He's worried about the message it sends. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greg is one of many people working in tech who are increasingly self-conscious about how the industry - represented by consumer-facing tech titans like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Twitter and Uber - is perceived: as under-regulated, overly powerful companies filled with wealthy tech bros and \"brilliant assholes\" with little regard for the local communities they occupy. Silicon Valley has taken over from Wall Street as the political bogeyman of choice, turning tech workers - like it or not - into public ambassadors for the 1%.</p><p>\"I would never say I worked at Facebook,\" said one 30-year-old software engineer who left the company last year to pursue an alternative career. Instead, at dinner parties he would give purposefully vague responses and change the subject. \"There's this song and dance you learn to play because people are quick to judge.\"</p><p>Now wealthy white geeks go to Stanford and then waltz into a VC or tech firm</p><p>Like Wall Street before, the tech industry is a justifiable punchbag. \"MBA jerks used to go and work for Wall Street, now wealthy white geeks go to Stanford and then waltz into a VC or tech firm.\"</p><p>Patrick Connelly, founder of health-tech startup Corevity, also sees the Wall Street parallels.</p><p>\"The focus of Silicon Valley used to be innovation with the wonderful bonus of money on the side of that, but those two things seem to have switched - just as the pencil pushing mentality of finance in the 70s became the champagne lifestyle in the 2000s,\" he said. \"People have come to have too much swagger and not enough insights.\"</p><p>With that swagger comes bad behavior, as highlighted at Uber, the subject of a litany of scandals including allegations of sexual harassment, intellectual property theft and driver manipulation. </p><p>\"We have this habit of highlighting and celebrating brilliant assholes like Steve Jobs and [Uber co-founder and ousted CEO] Travis Kalanick, when the reality is they are awful human beings,\" said Greg, head of technology at e-commerce startup Brandless, adding that it is women and people of colour who tend to bear the brunt of their behaviour.</p><p>\"It reminds me of stories that came out of Wall Street in the 1980s, when sexism was part and parcel of the culture,\" he added. \"Stories like that become public very quickly and people find out and paint tech with one brush.\"</p><p>Some of this behaviour stems from the hubris that positions profit-seeking corporations as benevolent forces in the world.</p><p>\"You are selling ads, you're not really making the world a better place,\" noted the former Facebooker. \"But most people drank the Kool-aid.\"</p><p> Related:  Divisive Russian-backed Facebook ads released to the public</p><p>It's a view echoed by one current Googler in her twenties, who is embarrassed by tech companies' cluelessness about their reputation outside of the Silicon Valley bubble. </p><p>\"Internally I don't think they have a good read on how they're perceived,\" she said, citing the backlash after it was discovered that ads were appearing around videos promoting extremist views on YouTube or the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election, including buying ads on Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>\"[Googlers] will say 'why are the papers making a big deal out of this, I don't get it'. Are you fucking joking? These people don't realise the scale of what they are doing,\" she said.</p><p>\"Some of these folks aren't the most socially gifted people and therefore suddenly having a culture encouraging this experience for them bleeds into everything, giving them a sense of self importance and entitlement. It's effectively like dealing with children all the time,\" Greg said, referencing his time at Dropbox when people would \"fly around the office on these stupid scooters and skateboards\". </p><p>The combination of the toxic culture in some tech companies combined with rising inequality and gentrification in local communities leads to \"aggression and suspicion\", he added.</p><p>Greg first experienced this in San Francisco in 2014, when protestors would picket the tech shuttle buses, which had become a symbol of gentrification and a lack of community engagement, and display signs saying \"techies go home\".</p><p> Related:  Apple secretly moved parts of empire to Jersey after row over tax affairs</p><p>\"Being in tech puts a badge on you. Things are going bad for a large section of the economy in this area and here's a shiny beacon of people getting paid far too much for what they do. It's a very easy target especially if you mark yourself as one,\" he said.</p><p>Greg mentions one particularly excruciating clash, captured on video, where a group of Dropbox employees awkwardly tried to move a bunch of local kids off a soccer pitch.</p><p>All of this feeds into the perception that techies are, according to the former Facebooker, \"pod people\" who aren't part of the community.</p><p>\"You wake up, get the shuttle bus, go to the bubble of campus and order food via an app when you get home. You are not a citizen, just a bizarre leach who makes money,\" he explained.</p><p>While there's still plenty of fodder for the satirical TV show Silicon Valley, Greg is hopeful the industry can become less embarrassing. When hiring for his own team he screens interviewees carefully to weed out \"covert brilliant assholes\".</p><p>\"There's a large and growing number of people who have negative emotions about how it is right now and really want to change it.\"</p><p>                     Contact the author: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:olivia.solon@theguardian.com\">olivia.solon@theguardian.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-38715449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX3-WVP1-F021-634W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The year was 1917, and the Fed had just started allowing banks to transfer funds by telegram free of any interest charge. More than a century on, central banks are grappling with another technological revolution: the rise of mobile payments and the turn away from cash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as in the early 20th century, when central banks created telegraph transfer networks, they are now coming to the view that they must design their own digital-payment networks in order to retain control of their monetary systems. One idea gaining favour is to issue a so-called central-bank digital currency (CBDC), which would exist only as electrons on a computer chip, rather than a coin or bill. Roughly 80% of central banks are doing some kind of CBDC work, from research to trials, according to one survey. Although still early, it is a trend that could give rise to tantalising new possibilities for monetary policy.</p><p>Most central bankers were sceptical about CBDCs at first, but in recent months their views have turned more positive, according to an analysis of their speeches by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a club of central banks (see chart). Partly, that is because they are now more familiar with the concept. China has already put the digital yuan into use on a limited test basis, and Sweden is close to that with the e-krona. The coronavirus pandemic has added to the urgency as more people shop online or pay with contactless cards or phones rather than cash.</p><p>The primary motivation for issuing a CBDC is likely to be defensive. The gradual demise of cash poses two basic risks. First, online-payment systems could fail, suffering outages or hacks. To safeguard the integrity of their currencies, central banks hope to offer fail-safe digital alternatives.</p><p>The second risk is that private-sector systems are too successful, with more people switching to payment platforms offered by big tech firms such as Facebook or Tencent. Many central banks began taking this risk more seriously when Facebook unveiled its plans for a digital currency in 2019. As Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the BIS, has put it, a shift towards such currencies would be like moving the economy from a town-square market\u2014where all vendors happily accept cash\u2014to competition between full-service department stores. Once popular enough, the department stores could stop you from shopping elsewhere and might also introduce new fees. Regulators could require private payment platforms to interconnect, but a well-designed CBDC would help ensure that this happens, by forming a digital bridge between different systems. </p><p>European central bankers are most exercised by the effects of a privately run digital currency on competition and the consumer interest. The Fed seems farther away from considering the idea, in part because Americans are keener on cash.</p><p>CBDCs also give central banks more control. They could allow for transactions to be easily tracked, perhaps making them more alluring to China's authorities. In the West, where surveys show that the public cares more about privacy, CBDCs may need to ensure anonymity, without circumventing anti-money-laundering checks. </p><p>Where things get really interesting from a theoretical perspective are the implications for monetary policy. This is particularly the case if the new currencies are \"retail\" CBDCS, made available for use by the public. (A less exciting option would be to issue \"wholesale\" CBDCs exclusively to commercial banks, much as they already get funds from the central bank, albeit underpinned by whizzier technology.) </p><p>CBDCs may make it easier to implement negative interest rates. Unlike old-fashioned cash, digital fiat can be programmed. For now, rates cannot go too negative, because savers can always demand cash, which by definition offers an interest rate of zero. But if digital cash is programmed to have a negative interest rate, people would have fewer fallbacks and central banks more flexibility.</p><p>Central bankers might also be tempted by the potential for targeted interventions\u2014much to the horror of those already worried about the clout of unelected monetary officials. Rather than lending to commercial banks, central banks would be able to top up individual currency accounts. During a downturn, they could transfer funds to those with low balances. After a natural disaster, they could direct support to affected areas. And they could offer consumption rebates depending on how and where the money is spent.</p><p>Yet these newfound powers would have drawbacks. For the CBDC to be a conduit for negative rates, countries would probably need to have eliminated cash, otherwise people could still opt for physical over virtual money. Moreover, if the CBDC does have a deeply negative interest rate, people might lose confidence in it. Savers could demand another currency or a different asset, such as gold. As for targeted interventions, there is a danger in programming too many special features into digital currencies. They would start to resemble securities with specific purposes, undermining the fungibility that has been a feature of money since the days of cowrie shells.</p><p>Central banks would also have to pay heed to new vulnerabilities. In the event of a panic, savers could convert their bank deposits into their CBDC accounts, adding to stresses on the financial system. Even without a panic, strong demand for CBDCs could chip away at banks' deposit bases, making them more reliant on wholesale funding, which is often more costly and less stable. Some economists argue that limits on withdrawals and on issuance might help avoid some of these effects.</p><p>In any case, the policy ramifications are the stuff of monetary fiction for now. A more practical concern is whether central banks can succeed in building sturdy, easy-to-use CBDCs. The past few months have brought several examples of failures in public technology, from overwhelmed unemployment websites in America to an abandoned coronavirus-tracing app in Britain. No government wants to see its currency crash, even if only virtually. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Paper's past it</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-MC8M1GA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-G6B1-DY2R-2016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

In fact, your clicks and taps may have helped build them. Since 2008, renewable energy has gone from 9% to 18% of the U.S. energy mix, according to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A big part of that shift stems from tech companies' rapid buildup of cloud storage centers and a move to burnish their public image by vowing they'll run these centers on sources such as wind and solar.</p><p>Rather than lose  deep-pocketed customers,  power companies are changing policies and crafting deals that meet increased demands for renewable energy, in some cases shifting away from  electricity supplies such as coal and natural gas - even in coal mining states such as West Virginia.</p><p>\"We have the ability to shape the market,\" said Michael Terrell, head of Google Energy Policy. \"If you build it, we will come.\"</p><p>Last year, the top four corporate users of renewable energy in the world were Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Google announced this month that as of 2017, all of its facilities and data centers ran on 100% renewable electricity.</p><p>Coal declines</p><p>The practice of insisting power companies offer wind- and solar-sourced supplies is spreading.  Walmart, GM and Budweiser all have goals to run more of their global business off renewable energy.</p><p>This is bad news for the  coal industry. Coal producers have seen their share of U.S. power generation decrease since 2008, even as the Trump administration promised to roll back what it considers hostile environmental regulations. Since the government is not going to discourage production, the coal industry has to deal only with the marketplace. The problem is that a growing portion of the marketplace demands green energy.</p><p>\"There's no federal or state law out there today that says you must do this, but there are boards of directors that say, 'We want to set a carbon footprint goal for our companies,'\" said Appalachian Power President  Chris Beam.</p><p>In December, the Charleston, W.Va-based utility contracted with Bluff Point Wind Energy Center in Indiana to buy 120 megawatts of wind-generated electricity, green power it can offer to companies that make it a requirement on where they'll locate, Beam said.</p><p>Appalachian Power generates 61% of its electricity by burning coal and 5% from wind and solar. By 2031, Beam said, he hopes to get that mix to 51% coal and 25% wind and solar.</p><p>There's a trickle-down effect. Big tech companies push their suppliers to go green. Apple which said last month that 100% of the electricity it uses for its facilities and data centers comes from renewables, said nearly two dozen of its suppliers - such as manufacturers of batteries, keyboards and lenses - have made a commitment to 100% renewable energy.</p><p>\"The smart ones are seeing it as a competitive advantage,\" said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration. \"They know they have an edge in competing for Apple's business.\"</p><p>A public shaming</p><p>The tech push toward renewable began in earnest in 2011, when Greenpeace released a report calling out data centers for being huge users of electricity created by non-renewable sources. It came at an opportune time. Going green fit tech's corporate ethos. The companies were flush with cash, making it easier for them to make choices that were more expensive.</p><p>\"The tech companies have knowingly and willingly paid a premium for green power ... because it advanced their self-stated goals,\" said Greg Morgan of  Dominion Energy.</p><p>Almost 50% of corporate investment in offsite renewable energy in the USA has been from tech companies, said John Hoekstra, vice president at Schneider Electric, an  energy management and automation company.</p><p>Walmart said it gets 28% of its global electric needs from renewable energy and wants to hit 50% by 2025. Last year, Budweiser said that it would be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025.</p><p>Companies such as Google</p><p>and Apple commit to running their facilities on 100% renewable energy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BURLFP-bur-1953557265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BURLFP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-82V1-JC3H-02PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256624</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Burlington Free Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Burlington Free Press (Vermont)</publicationName><edition>2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Revenue climbed 20% to $63.4 billion. Analysts, on average, expected $62.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also said operating income in the current quarter will be $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion, well below analyst estimates of $4.34 billion.</p><p>The third quarter is the period when Amazon typically invests in its facilities for the busy holiday shopping season at the end of the year, so big spending on the one-day shipping initiative spooked investors, said R.J. Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.</p><p>\"The company's been pretty upfront about investing in one-day shipping,\" he said. \"This is their heaviest investment period of the year, so it's when we're most likely to see a pullback.\"</p><p>Amazon's spending growth in the second quarter accelerated across the board, including for marketing to promote the annual Prime Day sale and on technology and content, which includes money for engineers and video programming. Operating expenses increased 21% to $60.3 billion in the quarter, faster than revenue. Shipping costs jumped 36% to $8.13 billion.</p><p>Although e-commerce remains Amazon's biggest source of sales, other businesses -- such as cloud computing, logistics for online merchants and advertising -- are growing faster and now generate almost half of the company's quarterly revenue.</p><p>In addition to greater competition, Amazon faces increasing scrutiny from government antitrust regulators and lawmakers who argue that Amazon acts like a monopoly to dominate online shopping. The U.S. Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it was opening a broad antitrust review into whether big technology companies are using their power to blunt competition.</p><p>\"Regulator risk is the No. 1 risk for the big tech companies, including Amazon,\" said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.</p><p>Amazon reported its results Thursday after the close of regular trading. Its shares fell 1.6% to $1,943.05 on Friday. The stock has climbed nearly 30% this year, pushing the company's market value near the $1-trillion mark it surpassed briefly in September.</p><p>Amazon Web Services sales increased 37% to $8.38 billion in the second quarter, missing analyst estimates of $8.5 billion. Cloud computing is one of Amazon's most profitable businesses, fueling investments in other parts of the company.</p><p>Despite the disappointing profit outlook, Amazon has a track record of making long-term investments that ultimately pay off, said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. \"They've got some growing pains ... but they're managing that pretty well,\" he said. \"That can only be a good thing longer term, and, frankly, that's how I think the market will be looking at it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: MOVING products closer to customers for one-day delivery was more costly and complicated than expected.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2018</p><p>(Trump deleted the original tweets a few hours later, but re-posted the statements to Twitter around 11 a.m. The newer tweets refer to the \"Fake News\" media\" instead of the \"Fake New Media,\" but are otherwise the same.)</p><p>Why was Trump tweeting about this at 5:30 a.m. on a Tuesday? One possibility - which many seemed to assume - is that Trump was Googling \"Trump news\" in an early morning investigation into one of his favorite topics - bias against himself.\u00a0 In all likelihood, however, Trump is repeating a claim that first appeared two days ago on PJ Media, a conservative news site, which published a piece with the headline, \"96 Percent of Google Search Results for 'Trump' News Are from Liberal Media Outlets.\"</p><p>Perhaps ironically, the PJ Media story came up in the first several results for \"Trump News\" when I performed a Google search for the phrase minutes after the president's tweet. As other reporters noted, the top news result this morning listed under a Google search for \"Trump News\" was from Fox News.</p><p>The PJ Media story has already made the rounds on conservative media by the time Trump tweeted about it. Lou Dobbs also tweeted it out two days ago, tagging the president's Twitter handle:</p><p>Tech Giants Are Crushing Conservatives: 96 Percent of Google Search Results for ' @realDonaldTrump' News Are from Liberal Media Outlets <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/V6FBgEA0fI\">https://t.co/V6FBgEA0fI</url> #Trendingvia @pjmedia_com #MAGA #TrumpTrain #AmericaFirst #Dobbs</p><p>- Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) August 26, 2018</p><p>The topic came up again on Dobbs's show on Fox Business\u00a0on Monday, where vloggers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, popularly known as Diamond and Silk,\u00a0called it \"a form of political lynching.\"</p><p>Tech companies like Google, Diamond warned, have outsize influence around the world.</p><p>\"These big tech companies don't care about conservative voices ... what they want to do is push their narrative,\" she said, adding that the\u00a0government should \"step in and really check this out.\"</p><p>Silk accused Google of wielding politically-honed search algorithms to censor conservatives. Dobbs agreed.</p><p>\"Thank goodness\" Trump uses Twitter to get around the media, Dobbs said in the segment.</p><p>This morning, Trump tweeted about Google. Afterward, the Drudge report claimed credit for bringing the issue to his attention, tweeting, \"THE DRUDGE LINK THAT STARTED IT ALL...\"\u00a0       </p><p>The actual PJ Media story is based on a search in Google News for \"Trump,\" which is probably a slightly different search than the one the president tweeted about, which was \"Google search,\" presumably the main google.com search bar. (Each of those two parts of Google uses different practices to rank results.) The PJ Media author performed the search a handful of times across a few different computers and then listed the news outlets appearing in the first 100 results for each query. The 96 percent figure seen in Trump's tweet and the piece's headline draws on these findings.</p><p>The PJ Media author used a to determine a publication's leanings and found what it deemed to be major right-leaning news sources with large reporting staffs like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, but didn't see several smaller right-wing and right-leaning sites better known for their commentary in the results, including the\u00a0National Review, Breitbart, the Blaze, the Daily Wire, Hot Air, Townhall, Red State and PJ Media.</p><p>\"While not scientific, the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content,\" the author writes.</p><p>Google News results are ranked on a variety of factors, and the results are personalized to some extent. According to Google, the rankings are supposed\u00a0\"to promote original journalism, as well as to expose users to diverse perspectives.\"</p><p>There are several factors that contribute to those results, including \"freshness\" of content and the extent to which it contains original reporting, as opposed to just aggregation or commentary on the news. Those rankings, Google says, are provided by algorithms. And of course, the results have a lot to do with the specific terms you choose to search.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday morning, a Google spokesperson addressed Trump's claim about Google search results.</p><p>\"When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"</p><p>The Trump administration is \"taking a look\" at whether Google and its search engine should be regulated by the government, said Larry Kudlow, Trump's economic adviser, outside the White House on Tuesday.</p><p>\"We'll let you know,\" Kudlow said. \"We're taking a look at it.\"</p><p>There are many other reasons PJ Media didn't see certain conservative publications\u00a0in the top 100 results in their survey, based on how the Google\u00a0News algorithm works, and the specific moments in which the searches were conducted. But the accusation of bias has been around for a while and is a mainstay of how right-wing outlets talk about tech companies like Google.</p><p>In July, Republicans accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of bias against conservatives at a hearing about \"content filtering\" practices of major tech companies. As my colleague Tony Romm reported, multiple Republican lawmakers on the panel used the hearing to accuse the companies of a litany of things that they believed were proof of bias.</p><p>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) said Google was censoring the word \"Jesus\" in some search results, a claim he did not give Google time to address. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) asked Facebook about falling traffic for\u00a0controversial conspiracy\u00a0site Gateway Pundit.</p><p>The questions were similar to those asked of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in April, when multiple Republican lawmakers used their time with Zuckerberg to talk about Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump vloggers.\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) used their complaint as an example of \"a\u00a0pervasive pattern of political bias\" during the hearing, for example. The context was, the midst of algorithmic changes that impacted traffic for many publishers on Facebook, Diamond and Silk had said that their traffic was falling, which was proof of Facebook's anti-conservative bias.</p><p>Soon, it will be Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey's turn. He's scheduled to testify during a Sept. 5 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on algorithms and content monitoring. In advance of that hearing, Dorsey has been on a media tour, discussing a wide range of topics (including perceptions of bias) with mainstream and conservative news outlets.</p><p>Claims like this, of a massive conspiracy of bias against conservative ideas by all the big tech companies, don't have to be airtight to be viral.

Our top story: In Britain, MPs have again rejected government efforts to call a snap general election. It's the sixth defeat for the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, in little over a week. Parliament is now set to be suspended for five weeks. </p><p>Authorities in the Bahamas have defended their response to Hurricane Dorian. Aid still hasn't reached tens of thousands in the worst-hit areas - and many bodies haven't been recovered. And this video is trending on BBC.com. The author Margaret Atwood has told the BBC that her best-selling book the Handmaid's Tale has got \"a lot closer to reality\" since she wrote it 30 years ago. The sequel, called The Testaments, is due to be published on Tuesday. That's all. Stay with BBC World News. We have lots more of all of our stories on the website including what is taking place in the Lords at the moment, the prorogation of Parliament. We go to Rico to get the business news. Google competition pro. A group of 50 states and territories in the US launch an investigation into the search giant's dominance of online advertising. Alibaba's boss steps down from his role as executive chairman as he marks his 55th launch an investigation into the search giant's birthday. Good morning, Asia. Hello, world. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for another exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I am Rico Hizon. We start off with the world's biggest search engine. 50 groups and territories in the United States have launched an investigation into Google's dominance of the online advertising market. A Samira Hussain reports from New York, there are a mounting number of probes of big technology giants by authorities in America. This is not something you see very often in Washington, DC, Democrats and Republicans working together. But together they stood on the steps of the Supreme Court, announcing an investigation into the business practices of the business giant Google. And well Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we all have a common bond and that is we are charged with responsibility of protecting the citizens of our state. Visa state officials are looking at Google's search engine and is digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own size. This is not the only investigation to hit intact. Last week another investigation of state officials found an anti-trust look into Facebook. We decided to probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big. In the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms stop and that will leave policy with another question does just do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in our efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. The troubled Japanese carmaker Nissan, the chief executive has said he will be stepping down next week stop shares are rising by on this news. He has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. Although he denies any wrongdoing. The company has been embroiled in a scandal since its former boss was arrested late last year and charged over alleged financial misconduct. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmakers' For some time he has expressed his strongest desire to pass the baton to the next generation. Under the current circumstances board has decided his resignation to take place as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: Took a lot of time but the in-house investigation has finished.

Our top story: President Trump's attended a state banquet hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, as he begins his UK state visit. He praised \"decades of treasured friendship\" between the US and UK. But some politicians boycotted the occasion and the Leader of the Opposition will attend protests against him on Tuesday. </p><p>Pakistan's investigating whether medical malpractice could be behind a sudden spike in HIV. Around 600 children have been diagnosed in a month. And efforts to change attitudes to high heels in Japan has caught people's attention online. A petition calling for a ban on workplaces forcing women to wear them has gained nearly 20,000 signatures. The Ku Too campaign mimics the Me Too movement, playing on the Japanese words for 'shoe' and 'pain'. That's all. Stay with BBC World News. We have lots more news stories on our website and more about what President Trump will be doing on Tuesday, his second day of his state visit. Now it is time for the business news. Fangs blunted. The US heavyweights are set to launch groves into the sector. Tiananmen Square anniversary. China's economy 30 years on from the brutal crackdown that shook the world. Good Morning, Vietnam, hello, well. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for an exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I'm at Rico Hizon. We kick off the programme with US technology stocks. They slumped overnight in New York under reports that enforcers are set to launch probes into the sector's biggest players. The so-called Faangs. They are all losing ground overnight. The biggest loser among the major indices. Michelle Fleury has all the details from New York. The spark that set it offers the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny. US anti-trust enforcers have apparently carved up jurisdiction for possible investigation into Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. It is not uncommon for the agencies to negotiate over who gets to vet which companies and markets. It is to avoid application, stepping on each other's toes. And claiming jurisdiction is still a long way from filing an actual anti-trust lawsuit. It is worth noting that the last big anti-trust suit in the United States was against Microsoft and that was roughly 20 years ago. Part of the challenge is that it is hard to show American consumers that have been harmed. That is a requirement of the law. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook and turn around and say, hang on a second, we are providing services for free in exchange for people's personal data. But make no mistake, the threat is real. For a while, many Americans have come to believe that the tech industry is too much power and ease to be reined in. But Washington has tended to be hands off. Silicon Valley was seen as an engine of economic growth not be tampered with. But opinion is shifting. Republican Sadeghi companies have a liberal bias against them, while the Democrats say these firms are too powerful and are hurting consumers and society. To quote Bob Dylan, it seems for the big tech companies the Times are changing. Michelle Fleury New York. Apple has been holding its annual developers conference in San Jose, California. This year's headline grabbing announcement is a phasing out of iTunes. The download store that upended the music industry when it first was launched in 2001. The BBC's North America technology reported Dave Lee has the details. It has been almost 20 years since Steve Jobs introduced iTunes into the world. The world of entertainment has changed a lot since then. As many Apple fans have been predicting for some time, iTunes is going to be phased out and replaced, instead, with three separate apps, one for music, one for podcast, and one for Apple's TV subscription service that is coming later this year. Another significant announcement at this year's event was a feature Apple 's calling sign in with Apple. It creates a unique e-mail address for every app you sign up to. Which means if there is a database down the line it will not affect you as much. And that data is not going to be useful for advertisers, either. For the first time in six years Apple announced a new desktop PC. It will cost $5,999</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-d5a4b138e9b34d85b112e2f4a2566d0d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W87-C7N1-JBH6-C1TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But there is also a lot of switching right now in terms of oil surprises -- oil prices. They are looking at Saudi Arabia for supply. That's correct, so the US has made it very clear that it is very serious about these sanctions on Iran and the allies of the US around the world, with the threat of also secondary sanctions through the banking system, are switching their supply sources away from Iran where they can. </p><p>No technology is arguably more responsible for shaping the modern internet than Google. From its humble beginnings at Stanford dorm until now, 1 billion people use its services every month and this month marks 20 years since the company was set up. How did they beat the competition? Mark Einstein says the company was simply in the right place at the right time, with the right business model. It came out with the better product, a better search algorithm and they really expanded into the mobile and social media space and the online video space. So I think that has a lot to do with it. Is there any company, in your view, or any up-and-coming technology company that can topple Googlefrom its lofty perch? I think that at this stage of the game where we are seeing internet collectivity and internet users not really growing like they used to, I think it is very difficult. There are competitors out there, like Duck Duck Go, but I think Googlehas gotten so big that the question is are we going to see Googlebroken up because of how dominant they are? Googlenow facing ethical questions, especially amidst this Russian meddling in US elections in 2016. How do these companies like Googlewalks a fine line to handle this ethical dilemma the industry faces right now? So I think these big tech companies have pretty much been living in the wild West in terms of regulation up until very recently, but we have seen the dilemma the industry faces, and the US is now talking about and Thai trusts, so I think more regulation of tech giant is something to expect going forward -- anti-trust. India is a signatory to the Paris climate agreement which means 40% of the energy it uses needs to come from renewable sources by 2030. One thing you get plenty of in India is sunshine so the government has set ambitious targets for solar panel generation in the country. India started setting up solar facilities later began compared to China, the US and Europe, and is now one of the solar markets in the world. But good recent policy uncertainties hinder progress? Our correspondent has more. What used to be dry, barren land in this southern state is now covered with millions of solar panels. This is one of the biggest such parks in the world. Thousands of farmers leased out fields they struggled to grow crops in, allowing power companies to harvest energy instead. Several firms have set up plants here. This one belongs to a Finnish company. Firm's boss tells me that India contributes a significant chunk the total solar power added in the world. In India alone, around 50 gigawatts would be added. So that is huge. And it is not just large solar farms. Rooftop installations are also proving popular. In a country where electricity from traditional distribution networks is often unreliable and patchy, it would make sense for factories to have their own solar energy on the rooftops. But the point at which this went from being an idea to something executed in reality was about three years ago, when the cost of power generated from the sun became cheaper than that from additional energy sources. These solar panels were set up about a year ago. They power the factory below. Nearly 90% of the machines here work on electricity generated from sunlight, manufacturing fertiliser bags. The company's power costs have gone down by one third. Now, while solar energy might be cheaper in the long-term, it costs a lot of money to set up a power station. Firms they need more support to make the switch. -- firms say they need more support. TRANSLATION: Banks do not give loans for these plans. They turned me down saying it is not a tried and tested activism. I finally funded it myself, but not everyone has that kind of cash available. Recently the government also announced that it plans to impose duties on imported solar panels. Nearly 90% come from overseas, while</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-96c60bb7da724088bf120c35dc64d5ff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBG-PV71-JBH6-C37P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The issue is making headlines for its role in systemic racism in the U.S., and for its privacy implications in Europe. Several large tech companies announced plans to scale back or pause sale of facial recognition technology, but the market for this product is still expected to be booming in the coming years   see our Chart of the Week for a growth estimate.</p><p>READ MORE: Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here, and read our latest coverage on the crisis here.</p><p>Chart of the Week  </p><p>Top Stories  </p><p>Podcast: COVID-19 shows many ESG agendas have 'forgotten about the people'</p><p>The pandemic has brought social issues to the forefront and highlighted that the climate agenda cannot come at the expense of people, Mikkel Larsen, chief sustainability officer at Singapore-based DBS Group, tells ESG Insider. The bank stopped financing coal-fired power plants, but only after finding price-competitive renewable energy alternatives. \"We were not willing to accept that lack of electricity   we are in Southeast Asia where 65 million are still without electricity   was necessarily going to be the trade-off,\" Larsen said.</p><p>Big tech's pause on facial recognition not likely to blunt deployment</p><p>The global facial recognition market is expected to reach $15.4 billion by 2024, according to estimates from Variant Market Research. Though recent calls for police reform have thrown a spotlight on the risks involved in the technology, various companies stand ready to capitalize on the segment's potential by continuing to work with law enforcement and by supporting other use cases.</p><p>Facial recognition tech tests the limits of Europe's data privacy laws</p><p>The European Union and the U.K. are separately exploring new guidelines for live facial recognition technology, which pairs surveillance equipment with visual-recognition software so images can be analyzed, for example by searching a database of suspects for matches   known as remote biometric identification. In Europe, remote biometric identification is banned under the General Data Protection Regulation. A European Commission spokesperson said this is the most \"intrusive\" form of facial recognition, and its use is also governed by human rights law.</p><p>Environmental </p><p>5G networks better positioned to weather extreme storms   experts</p><p>Utilities face tough choices in meeting climate goals after natural-gas binge</p><p>'This is all about risk': Cheniere sharpens focus on emissions in new ESG report</p><p>Social</p><p>As gold rises, industry faces mounting concerns over human rights diligence</p><p>California adopts new tool to determine what utility customers can afford to pay</p><p>ESG comes into focus for some pipeline firms seeking new investors</p><p>Governance</p><p>Russian central bank sets responsible investment principles for market players</p><p>Westpac review finds management of risk culture 'immature, reactive'</p><p>France's regulator calls for separation of insurers' CEO and chairman positions</p><p>ESG Indices </p><p>Upcoming events</p><p>Sustainability Impact Conference NAEMAug. 4-5 Online</p><p>Sustainability Reporting and Communications Europe 2020 Ethical Corporation Sept. 1-2 Online</p><p>Water &amp; Long-Term Value  Skytop Strategies  Sept. 1-3  Calistoga, Calif.</p><p>ESG Regulation, Data and Reporting in Financial Services Informa Sept. 10 Online</p><p>Forum on Green Finance and Investment OECD Centre on Green Finance and Investment Oct. 6-9 Online</p><p>ESG &amp; Sustainability Forum  Infrastructure Investor  Oct. 12  Berlin, Germany</p><p>Sustainable Returns: ESG Investing  Institutional Investor  Nov. 19-20  New York, N.Y.</p><p>New York 2020: Sustainable Business and Finance Responsible Investor Dec. 2-3 New York, N.Y.</p><p>ESG and Sustainable Investments Forum  Institutional Investor  Date TDB Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><p>Questions or suggestions?

Impulsada por su fundador, Mark Zuckerberg, y por un grupo de 27 socios, la idea es que empiece a funcionar en 2020 y su objetivo pasa por \"ofrecer una moneda sencilla y global\" a trav\u00e9s de tecnolog\u00eda blockchain.Pero el proyecto Libra no es s\u00f3lo eso. Es mucho, mucho m\u00e1s. Es una idea de dimensiones tan colosales que s\u00f3lo as\u00ed se explica la respuesta en tromba y casi un\u00e1nime de los gobiernos, reguladores y supervisores a nivel mundial para intentar frenarla. Sin ir m\u00e1s lejos, ha sido uno de los temas centrales de la reuni\u00f3n de los ministros de Finanzas del G-7 esta semana en Chantilly (Francia), donde han llegado a calificarla de riesgo \"sist\u00e9mico\". Tambi\u00e9n esta semana, el secretario del Tesoro de EEUU, Steven Mnuchin, manifest\u00f3 sus inquietudes respecto a que pueda ser una v\u00eda para el blanqueo de capitales y tanto el BCE como la Fed han advertido de que vigilar\u00e1n y actuar\u00e1n para que cumpla todos los requisitos legales.Demasiados temores para algo que se present\u00f3 a s\u00ed misma como una criptomoneda. Y esa es la clave, que Libra no es s\u00f3lo una criptomoneda, sino que detr\u00e1s del proyecto se esconde, en realidad, la pretensi\u00f3n de Zuckerberg y sus socios \u2013la llamada Asociaci\u00f3n Libra\u2013 de crear un sistema financiero fuera del control directo y la supervisi\u00f3n de los grandes poderes que manejan ahora los designios de la econom\u00eda mundial: Wall Street, bancos centrales, supervisores, reguladores, gobiernos, gigantes empresariales\u2026\"Todos mirar\u00e1n Libra con cierta hostilidad porque desde siempre han intentado controlar el monopolio de la oferta monetaria: es rentable y adem\u00e1s es el mecanismo para intentar insuflar m\u00e1s o menos actividad econ\u00f3mica, aparte de representar un elemento de soberan\u00eda. El cambio no ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil\", apunta Ignacio de la Torre, socio y economista jefe de Arcano.\"El mercado de activos criptogr\u00e1ficos hasta ahora parec\u00eda no representar ninguna amenaza y los reguladores estaban medianamente tranquilos. </p><p>Sin embargo, la creaci\u00f3n y puesta en marcha de uno de estos activos por una empresa que tiene 2.300 millones de usuarios mensuales (sin contar los de otras empresas de su mismo grupo) es harina de otro costal\", se\u00f1ala Cristina Carrascosa, Of Counsel en el despacho Pinsent Masons y miembro del Observatorio Blockchain de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea.Asimil\u00e1ndola con algunas de las monedas virtuales m\u00e1s populares, como Bitcoin o Ethereum, Facebook posiciona en cierta medida a su nueva criatura hasta que pueda ponerla en marcha, pero lo cierto es que son muchas m\u00e1s las cosas que las separan que las que las unen.\"Est\u00e1 controlada por un grupo peque\u00f1o de empresas, respaldada por activos de bajo riesgo, todav\u00eda no se sabe exactamente para qu\u00e9 va a servir\u2026\", enumera Carrascosa. Adem\u00e1s, no es an\u00f3nima y no fluct\u00faa libremente por oferta y demanda, sino que \"es un stable coin, es decir, su valor estar\u00e1 respaldado por activos en una divisa dura, presumiblemente el d\u00f3lar\", a\u00f1ade De la Torre. Eso implica que el valor de Libra depender\u00e1 de los activos mantenidos en la reserva creada por los miembros de la asociaci\u00f3n y no de la din\u00e1mica de la oferta y la demanda, como sucede con Bitcoin. Adem\u00e1s, las divisas virtuales m\u00e1s populares est\u00e1n basadas en un red blockchain descentralizada, es decir, la propia red aprueba las transacciones, mientras que Libra es centralizada, por lo que el consorcio se ocupar\u00e1 de validar cada transacci\u00f3n y, por tanto, tendr\u00e1 el control\u2026 y el poder. Aqu\u00ed radica gran parte de la preocupaci\u00f3n de los reguladores. Esta semana, David Marcus, director ejecutivo de Calibra y encargado de integraci\u00f3n de Libra en los servicios de Facebook, compareci\u00f3 ante el comit\u00e9 de Banca, Vivienda y Asuntos Urbanos del Senado de EEUU para ofrecer m\u00e1s detalles del proyecto. Los senadores quer\u00edan conocer en qu\u00e9 consiste Libra, para qu\u00e9 va a utilizarse o de qu\u00e9 manera se garantizar\u00e1 la seguridad de los usuarios, entre otros aspectos. Ninguno sabe en realidad c\u00f3mo enfrentarse a este nuevo escenario.El otro gran tent\u00e1culo del criptoproyecto de Facebook salpica al negocio bancario tradicional. \u00bfHay que vincular Libra con el desembarco de Facebook \u2013y, en general, de las Big Tech (Facebook, Amazon, Apple y Google)\u2013 en ese sector? \"Rotundamente s\u00ed\", sentencia Carrascosa. \"Si analizas el Whitepaper de Libra, muchas de sus afirmaciones hacen referencia a la inclusi\u00f3n financiera, que ha sido el leitmotiv de la industria de las criptomonedas, pero si uno se fija en el detalle, aparecen conceptos como pr\u00e9stamos diarios, pagos sin fricci\u00f3n y otros que pueden sonar a que Facebook quiere ofrecer productos financieros sobre blockchain\", a\u00f1ade.En el mercado, este es uno de los aspectos que m\u00e1s inquietud genera. Hace tiempo que las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas est\u00e1n tanteando sus posibilidades, aunque las exigencias regulatorias y de solvencia a las que tendr\u00edan que enfrentarse act\u00faan por el momento como freno.Es probable que ni Google ni Amazon ni Apple ni Facebook quieran ser un gran banco, pero todas buscan operar de alguna manera con el dinero de sus usuarios. Por el momento, cuentan con licencias como entidades de pago, lo que les permite realizar transferencias, procesar recibos, pagos con tarjeta e incluso facilitar financiaci\u00f3n a los clientes. Lo que no pueden hacer, porque para ello necesitar\u00edan una ficha bancaria, es captar dep\u00f3sitos.La amenaza para las entidades tradicionales no es desde\u00f1able y no s\u00f3lo por el conocimiento tecnol\u00f3gico y el desarrollo que atesoran, \"sino sobre todo porque, hasta que no se modifique la legislaci\u00f3n, pretenden entrar en dicho negocio sin pasar por el tortuoso camino de la regulaci\u00f3n y el compliance por el que s\u00ed pasan los bancos\", apunta la abogada de Pinsent Masons. Sin ir m\u00e1s lejos, eso ha provocado que EEUU se plantee la posibilidad de prohibir por ley que las tecnol\u00f3gicas tengan acceso a esta industria.A medida que tecnol\u00f3gicas como Facebook se posicionen como proveedores de servicios financieros, su \u00e9xito podr\u00eda permitirles controlar no s\u00f3lo la distribuci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n competir m\u00e1s directamente con los operadores tradicionales mediante la fabricaci\u00f3n de productos financieros adaptados minuciosamente para cada cliente. Los dispositivos actuar\u00edan como una especie de chivato para seguir las pr\u00e1cticas de consumo de cada persona a cada segundo. \"Si se cruzan los datos que recopile el consorcio con los que posee Facebook, ser\u00e1 relativamente f\u00e1cil poder adivinar de qu\u00e9 tipo de cliente se trate. Se puede extraer informaci\u00f3n muy valiosa\u2026 y peligrosa\", advierte De la Torre. Entran en juego, por tanto, la seguridad y la privacidad. Sin ellas, quedar\u00eda al descubierto una de nuestras partes m\u00e1s sensibles: c\u00f3mo gastamos el dinero. Las tecnol\u00f3gicas \"podr\u00edan deducir con relativa facilidad los pagos de una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito o incluso amenazar con desvelar datos personales\", apunta Joaqu\u00edn Rivera, economista de Arcano.Pero no todo es tan negativo. Zuckerberg y la Asociaci\u00f3n Libra defienden que su proyecto abre una v\u00eda para reducir la pobreza. \"La creaci\u00f3n de un ecosistema alrededor de un moneda digital puede conllevar enormes posibilidades, por ejemplo, que las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) disfruten de reducci\u00f3n de costes y trazabilidad de sus proyectos\", cuenta Rivera. La cuenta atr\u00e1s para comprobarlo ha comenzado.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MUNDO-REFID/98963191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MUNDO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM8-GHT1-F16M-C199-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256121</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n General, S.L.U.

Increasingly bipartisan politics remove the bonding power of centrist or moderate forces because there is increasingly unrestrained bids for power.\u00a0\u00a0 Too often, this creates gridlock in the legislature, diluting public trust in its efficacy and pushing decision-making increasingly to the Executive. \u00a0In more and more elections, from Erdogan to Trump, the public vote for charismatic leaders who win elections at the expense of polarizing society.\u00a0</p><p>Forty years ago, most societies would have 60% of people in the centrist or moderate group, with 20% each on the left or right side of political or social views.\u00a0 Today\u2019s polarization has shifted 40% each to the left or right, with 20% only in the middle, which may swing either way depending on the mood of the moment. Thus in the recent Hong Kong district elections, the pro-democrats won 60% of the votes, but took most of the seats due to the simple majority win rule.\u00a0 There is still 40% of the population which has voted for the Hong Kong government, quite like the 40% entrenched supporters for Trump, despite repeated attacks by the Democrats.</p><p>Polarization by generational divideis a knowledge and experience issue. Having more experience of the consequences of social disorder, the older generation tends toprefer the status quo.\u00a0 Lacking that experienceand knowledge, the young generation wants change now and some are willing to be violent to make dramatic changes.</p><p>Hence, truth or real information lies at the core of all social order, particularly democracy. Disrupters have discovered that you can turbo-charge social polarization throughtechnology by disseminatingbad or fake information. \u00a0The underlying public discontent with globalization, loss of jobs, fear of migration, social inequality, incompetent or corrupt governance is the dry prairie that needs only the spark of fake or false information to set ablaze.</p><p>In 2017, the Council of Europe\u2019sInformation Disorder\u00a0Report classified the malaise into three categories: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mis-information</emphasis>, when false information is shared, but no harm is meant; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dis-information</emphasis>, when false information is knowingly shared to cause harm; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mal-information</emphasis>, when genuine information is shared to cause harm, often by moving private information into the public sphere (trolling or doxing).</p><p>Information disorder is very disruptive, because bad information with ill-intentions can be produced and pushed at minimal costs with very high returns.</p><p>The world is therefore suffering from Severe Information Disorder Syndrome (SIDS), a viral attack not dissimilar to the 2003 Hong Kong SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome.\u00a0 Freedom of information on the internet has generated fake news that are targeted towards vulnerable groups, such as school-children, through computational amplification (AI manipulation of online views), filter bubbles and echo chambers that reinforce prejudices; eroding trust in evidence, institutions and truth.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It is bad enough that criminals, terrorists and fundamentalists are using social media to promote crime and discontent.\u00a0 It is worse when governments are involved in geo-political rivalry and use social media to disrupt each other, such as Cold War dissemination campaigns.\u00a0 Information viral attacks against each other create such fears that there is already talk of the Splinternet - balkanization of the Internet through national firewalls.\u00a0</p><p>As Carothers and O\u2019Donohue recognize, what makes SIDS intractable is that severe polarization damages all institutions essential to democracy, such as the police or judiciary.\u00a0 Polarization poisons everyday interactions and relationships, dividing families, fellow workers and civil society, contributing to spikes in hate crimes and political violence. Worse, once society is deeply divided, it is very difficult to heal.\u00a0 Governments cannot respond to divided societies in the speed and clarity which the public expects, precisely because there are no simple answers that can be agreed by a divided society.\u00a0 Worse, freedom of information guarantees that neither government, judiciary nor legislatures know how to stop fake news, because they are so difficult and costly to prove and punish.</p><p>In short, as long as fake news and echo chambers exist, there is currently no good way to counter the effects of SIDS.\u00a0 Even Google is not immune to internal attacks on its own biases and echo chambers.\u00a0 If these global tech platforms have hidden algorithms that perpetuate hate and polarization, what can governments do about this?\u00a0\u00a0 French President Macron, after the Yellow Vest protests,proposed in 2018a Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">, </emphasis>supported by 75 countries and companies like Microsoft and Huawei. Unfortunately, key players like the US, China, India, Brazil and Russia have not signed on.</p><p>We are therefore still far away from addressing SIDS viral attacks.\u00a0 Information viral outbreaks require not only cyberspace hygiene (public health prevention), but also global cooperation in regulation of Big Tech platforms and clear rules of the cyberspace game.As long as the world is globally and locally polarized, expect more mass protests through\u00a0 vicious SIDS outbreaks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>ANN Desk (Asia)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ANN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-109822</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP0-RC61-JDSH-23JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 7, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Thailand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

The Indian startup has developed a platform for visualizing and virtually customizing interior spaces, and it will use the funding to deepen research and development in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and 3D visual technologies. Real estate consultancy JLL led the round with participation from several undisclosed investors. (JLL)</p><p><br/> Co-working provider naked Hub acquires Gravity (China/Australia). Shanghai-based shared workspace operator naked Hub - which has venues across China, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the UK - will take over Gravity, an Australian provider of premium co-working spaces. The deal comes amid a boom in Asia-Pacific's co-working industry, with increasingly fierce competition between regional players like URWork and JustCo, and foreign entrants like US unicorn WeWork. (China Money Network)<br/> ZmyHome raises US$400,000 to disrupt listings (Thailand). The Thai startup seeks to challenge larger real estate portals like PropertyGuru by allowing buyers and vendors to transact directly and at lower cost by removing the need for agents and other intermediaries. The capital injection came from Singapore-based KK Fund. (Tech in Asia)<br/> Media and entertainment<br/> Rappler loses its license (The Philippines). The online news site had its certificate of incorporation revoked by country's Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) after allegedly falling foul of regulations limiting foreign investment in media companies. The SEC said that Rappler engaged in a \"deceptive scheme to circumvent the [Philippine] constitution\" under which \"its receipt of over a million dollars from a foreign investor would be theoretically defensible.\" (Philippine Daily Enquirer)<br/> Sleekr scores Money Forward funding (Indonesia/Japan). Japanese fintech firm Money Forward has made a strategic investment in Indonesian HR and accounts management platform Sleekr. The amount was not disclosed. The deal represents Money Forward's first investment in Southeast Asia, with the firm's CFO Naoya Kanesaka suggesting more are on the way. (Tech in Asia)<br/> Logistics and delivery<br/> On-demand delivery app Zoom closes US$1 million pre-series A round (Malaysia). Gobi Partners led the round, with Cana Asia, Spiral Ventures, and Cradle Fund also taking part. Zoom said it will use the funds to launch in Johor Bahru and Penang, expand its services in the Kuala Lumpur region, and work towards entering Indonesia and Thailand. It will also invest in white-labelling its interface for corporate clients. (Gobi Partners)<br/> Transportation<br/> Ofo rides into Pune (India). Chinese bike-sharing firm ofo is launching its first Indian service in partnership with payments app Paytm, which can be used to pay for ofo rides. Initially rolling out in Pune, ofo is next expected to expand to Chennai, Indore, Ahmedabad, and Bangalore. The Chinese company will face competition from local players Ola and Zoomcar, which have both launched bike-sharing services within the past few months. (Livemint)<br/> Big tech<br/> SoftBank mulls US$18 billion IPO for mobile phone unit (Japan). The Tokyo-based tech giant is planning to list shares in its mobile phone business towards the end of this year. It would be one of the largest IPOs in history and could be Japan's biggest, rivaling fellow telco NTT Docomo's US$18.1 billion stock market float in 1998. SoftBank would use proceeds to invest in foreign IT and telecom businesses. (Nikkei Asian Review)<br/> Alibaba and MediaTek partner on IoT (China/Taiwan). Alibaba's AI Labs unit has signed an agreement with Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek to collaborate on internet of things research and development in area such as smart home protocols, customized IoT chips, and AI smart hardware.

Transportation<br/> Taxi firm sues Grab over alleged unfair business practices (Vietnam). Vinasun has sued the Singapore-based ride-hailing company in a Ho Chi Minh City court, claiming its \"rampant\" promotion deals and discounts are akin to the \"dumping\" of manufactured goods. Vinasun further alleged that it must comply with more regulations than Grab, leading to unfair competition. Grab's lawyers contend that its software solution actually creates competition, and that Vinasun's evidence and methods of loss calculations are questionable. (The Straits Times)</p><p><br/> Blibli and Astra reported to join Go-Jek's latest funding round (Indonesia). Local ecommerce startup Blibli reportedly invested up to US$120 million in the ride-hailing giant's recent fundraise, which is expected to haul in around US$1.5 billion. Automotive firm Astra International is also said to have invested as much as US$170 million. Other reported backers of the round include JD, Google, Meituan-Dianping, Temasek, and Tencent. (e27)<br/> Didi does deal with allied auto giants (China). The ride-hailing firm has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance of automakers to explore future collaboration on electric car-sharing services in China. The potential partnership could see the manufacturers supplying all-electric battery car models for Didi's new service, said a person familiar with the matter. (Reuters) Fintech<br/> Alipay will soon be accepted at the Apple Store (China). Alipay, developed by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, will be the first third-party mobile payment system to be accepted at Apple's stores anywhere in the world. The service, though, will be limited to the US company's 41 China outlets for now. The move comes as Apple, whose Apple Pay system has not taken off in China, seeks to expand its footprint in the country. (Reuters) Property and real estate<br/> GoWork and Rework merge, become Go-Rework (Indonesia). The two shared workspace operators have joined forces and rebranded to create what they claim is the country's largest premium co-working provider. The newly combined company operates five venues across Jakarta and plans to expand to 50 locations throughout Indonesia by the end of this year, adding over 5,000 seats. (Go-Rework) Mobile<br/> Gogolook gets US$11.7 million (Taiwan). The app developer behind caller ID widget Whoscall nabbed the funds from unnamed investors. It will use the money to improve its user experience and expand into new markets. Gogolook launched in 2012 and was acquired by Korean web giant Naver the following year in a deal worth around US$17.6 million. (DealStreetAsia) Artificial intelligence<br/> Joveo raises US$5 million at series A (India). The startup, which provides its AI-driven job search platform to third-party partners, secured the funds in a round led by Nexus Venture Partners. It will use the fresh capital to enhance its product offerings, grow partnerships, and improve its AI and deep learning tech. (Inc42) Big tech<br/> Alibaba leads the world in blockchain patents (China). The Chinese tech giant had 44 patents related to blockchain technology published last year. That brings its all-time total to 49 - the highest number of blockchain-related patents belonging to a single organization globally. Chinese companies comprise 49 of the top 100 blockchain patent recipients worldwide last year.

Fintech<br/> SpherePay announces US$10 million funding and oBike integration (Singapore). The mobile payments startup has raised over US$10 million from undisclosed investors. It will use the funding to expand in Southeast Asia and add new features, such as bill payments and location-based services.

(SpherePay)</p><p><br/> BTCC bought out by Hong Kong investors (China). Formerly known as BTC China, BTCC became the country's first cryptocurrency exchange when it was founded in 2011. Amid China's regulatory crackdown on exchanges and other cryptocurrency trading-related businesses, it has been acquired by undisclosed Hong Kong-based investors, and will focus exclusively on serving the international market going forward. (Bloomberg) Ecommerce<br/> PCCW enters ecommerce space (Hong Kong). The Hong Kong telco has launched its own ecommerce platform, Habbitzz, to tap what it says is the territory's \"poorly served\" market. The site will focus on premium products to compete with incumbents such as Amazon and Taobao, and is headed by former JD chief operating officer Alex Bono. (Mumbrella) Transportation<br/> Ola begins Australia hiring drive in first international expansion (Australia/India). The Indian ride-hailing firm will begin inviting private vehicle owners and driver partners to work with it in Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney, with a view to commence commercial operations in early 2018.

The flagship Gogo store run by local startup Xiao Mang Guo Technology opened in the Sichuanese city four months ago.

The cashierless space is becoming a rapidly crowded one in China, with numerous startups competing against big tech players like Alibaba, JD, and Tencent. (Technode) Big tech<br/> Google completes HTC acquisition (Taiwan/US). The US tech giant has finalized its takeover of the Taiwanese company's smartphone design business. Around a fifth of HTC's engineering team is moving to Google, which will also receive a non-exclusive license to HTC's intellectual property as part of the US$1.1 billion deal announced last September.

It's a mixed picture in financial markets but the main points are: Tokyo (0.44%) and Sydney (o.o5%) are down. Seoul (1.1%) and Hong Kong (o.5%) are up, and Shanghai is flat. In currencies, the US dollar index is down slightly at 94.97. The Aussie dollar is up a bit in the past few hours at US71.21 while the yen is holding steady against the dollar. The pound is up at $1.323. The FTSE100 is seen opening up 0.1% while the Dax in Frankfurt will rise 0.6%, according to futures trade. Chinese exports grew 6.5% for the year so far, showing decent growth despite trade tensions. But the China customs agency warned that growth may slow in the fourth quarter Chinese media hints at state intervention to stem possible losses In Australia, mortgage lending was down 2.1% in August - more ethan the market expected and bad news for super-leveraged local housing industry Australia's Reserve Bank said the country is at risk from some external shocks such as a US-China trade war or a slowdown in China. Catch up with our market wrap here: Or check out Richard Partington's excellent explainer about why stocks are going down (or is that up?): And with that I'm wrapping up this blog. The inestimable Graeme Wearden will be back at 7am UK time. Thanks for joining me. And more still from China. The Shanghai Composite, which fell by as much as 6% on Thursday, was flat but in a sign of possible state intervention, the state-run Securities Times sought to soothe jittery investors by calling for more market-friendly policies from the government in Beijing. Courtesy of Reuters... Authorities \"should roll out positive measures so that investors know the government cares about the stock market, while listed companies and financial institutions should also contribute to improving market confidence,\" the media said State-owned Global Times said in an editorial that China's stock market \"has a limited impact on the whole Chinese economy, and the Chinese economy has withstood this round of impacts.\" \"What will happen to the US stock market and how it affects the US economy remain to be seen,\" the Global Times editorial said. More on China. The country's customs agency says foreign trade grow may slow in the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year. But reuters reports that spokesman Li Kuiwen says exporters are diversifying their markets, which will support overall export growth. The reflects a very strong start to 2018 - and a trade surplus of 1.44 trillion yuan (US$208.72 billion). But because it's only the first three quarters we don't know the full picture of how the trade tensions have impacted. Still with China, and the Shanghai market is exactly flat, while Hong Kong is up 0.5%. The Nikkei is off 0.44% and Sydney is just in the red by 0.05%. And in case you're wondering what all this is about, you're in good company... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn't have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It's a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be \"a positive development for financial stability\" However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies - especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities - there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia's banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn - much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It's down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan's big exporters. The Aussie dollar - a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region - has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We're currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ's profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank's return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. \"ANZ's profitability is dramatically lower than it was,\" he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (\"it's their money\" he said). But Keogh said: \"It's not - it should have been in the customer's pocket the whole time,\" to which Elliott puts his hands up: \"I accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to - but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.\" In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn't make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It's <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Shayne.Elliott@anz.com\">Shayne.Elliott@anz.com</email> The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. \"Every case is unique and they should expect a response,\" Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. \"I give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.\" He says he won't always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he \"will stay on top\" of responding to customer's concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he's meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's interim report which found \"greed\" had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, \"given what has been uncovered so far.\" ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was \"no pride\" being the subject of regulator Asic'sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a \"major fail\". He said \"fear\" was a \"strong word\" when it came to Asic, but the bank \"certainly respects Asic\". Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. \"The bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for 'sales' hasn't been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don't have that same middle layer, saying 'middle management have a sales target, but the juniors don't. We don't have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday's big moves. Losses are easing back already but it's early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today's data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We're off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country's biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you're reading outside Australia and you haven't followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia's financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We're also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump's comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as \"out of control\" because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it's still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day's trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I'm Martin Farrer and I'm taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday's 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain's FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields - the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday's selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum - the breadth of the decline - we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade - we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy - the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was 'disappointed' in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn't intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It's a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful - and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell's defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump's claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I'm now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump's attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday's Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here's the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there's nothing to celebrate -- instead, we're staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday's 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here's our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump's attempts to put pressure on America's central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 - the index of UK blue-chip shares - closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value - the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain's FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It's now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he's determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump's criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed's interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution's independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed's monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He's escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump's pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell's predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America's top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: \"It's a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful - and it causes difficulty doing business.\" Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I'm not going to fire him. I'm just disappointed. Here's the big picture tonight, and it's not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today's losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don't give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It's not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump's trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month's midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. \"Our multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" After a day of hectic selling, Britain's blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It's no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy's main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government's budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday's 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week's \"financial market turmoil is (long) overdue\". He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president's chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China's president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is 'concrete', so don't count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter's WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday's losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can't be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn't necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.\" Donald Trump's treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president's criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday's sell-off was a fairly normal event. \"Markets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.\" Yesterday's sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here's some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don't panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should 'stay calm' today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn't on the brink of a recession, so there's no reason to dump your portfolio: \"Isolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world's most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today's weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It's still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today's sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting \"a little bit too cute,\" adding: \"They're making a big mistake.\" More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an 'initial claim' for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn't rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren't rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain's FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the FrenchCAC is down 1.5% while Germany's DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan's Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX 'fear index', which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve 'crazy', hasn't helped the mood. The world's top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here's a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America's top central banker against Donald Trump's claim that the Federal Reserve has 'gone crazy': Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it's being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there's a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today's selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan's main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain's FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it's been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now \"we've talked ourselves into a sell-off\". Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: \"The sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China's growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. \"But for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed's expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF's meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: \"Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.\" Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it's harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There's no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York's 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday's plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies' costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump's trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here's a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China's stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today's sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That's a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields - the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday's selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum - the breadth of the decline - we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade - we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy - the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That's according to data provider MSCI, whose 'all country' index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That's thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning's heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It's been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US - despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic - most notably Trump who's been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months - I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn't a shock: \"The sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy's new budget, on top of today's other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain's FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China's Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year's trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund's meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was \"legitimate and necessary\" for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That's a rebuke to Donald Trump's claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. \"It is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high\". The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday's selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal's CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers' suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: \"Today's equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.\" Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: \"This is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve's projected rate path will choke off the expansion.\" Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan's Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as \"crazy\".... \"It's a bit of a bloodbath,\" said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \"It's primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\" European markets had already endured a bad week, and it's about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain's FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed 'crazy' for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: \"The Fed has gone crazy. \"No, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They're so tight.\" \"It's a correction we've been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.\" The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump 'achievement'), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what's going on. The President's criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.

Instead of placing the citizen at the heart of digital public policy with privacy, trust, security and inclusion as drivers of digital governance Asian governments are focusing instead on surveillance and command and control, which contradicts the spirit of a decentralized Internet and undermines citizen's rights.</p><p>Asia's digital governance is fragmenting from the global norm and morphing into two platforms with remarkably similar characteristics.</p><p>One is a China-driven model aptly called the Great Firewall where surveillance of citizens is an explicit objective and any external material deemed to be subversive is kept out. A complementary model has also emerged more recently, which can best be described as China-light, which seeks to emulate the control aspects of the Great Firewall.</p><p>There are of course overlaps between emulators of the China model (this list includes Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos) and those pursuing China-light (Singapore, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia). A common thread running through these two approaches, which differ only in intensity and scope, is the belief that the state is best positioned to police social media and protect the rights of citizens.</p><p>This was not how it was supposed to be. A decade ago, Asian political leaders spoke about the virtues of an open internet. Such talk has faded, and a narrowing of Asia's digital space is taking place against a backdrop of an intensifying trade war between America and China, where regional supply chains run the risk of a decoupling into distinct Sino and American spheres, upending Asia's durable economic model of the past few decades.</p><p>Digital fragmentation in the world's fastest growing region, with five G20 members, will complicate efforts to build global governance and standards.</p><p>Asia's digital landscape</p><p>Asian governments, including democratic ones, have developed an unhealthy obsession with what their citizens are up to on a daily basis. Their solution is round-the-clock monitoring in cities and towns, powered by new surveillance technologies.</p><p>Name tagging and facial recognition to track movement of citizens has become pervasive across the region, with China emerging as the preferred source of technology, knowledge, and techniques. While India's Supreme Court has ruled that privacy is a fundamental right, translating this into concrete citizen's protections will be difficult with the Modi government eager to emulate China's approach.</p><p>Asian governments are also following China in requiring that their citizen's data be housed within national borders and are rebelling against the established practice of data offshoring.</p><p>In the post-Snowden era and amidst increasing cyber risks, there are rational national security reasons for why governments may want to ring-fence customer data within national boundaries. However, Asian governments are paying little or no attention to how companies are using customer data within national boundaries, with widespread abuses going unchecked.</p><p>Global standards are still evolving and there is a strong case here for a uniform regional approach, perhaps via ASEAN or APEC, on standards governing customer privacy, payments, data collection and handling. Big tech companies and platforms operate across much of Asia and a regional approach will curb their current instinct of conducting regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>There is a genuine problem in Asia, as elsewhere in the world, with the proliferation of fake news and extremism. But instead of addressing the source of this problem, governments are clamping down by generously expanding the definition of fake news (Singapore) or by shutting down the internet altogether (India, Sri Lanka, and China being serial offenders).</p><p>As disseminators of news of all stripes, including the fake variant, the big tech firms have a primary responsibility in policing their platforms. However, the regulatory capacity of many Asian governments to monitor this is weak and in crisis situations, governments prefer to shut the pipes altogether.</p><p>Digitalization of course is not all about surveillance and holds the promise of driving inclusion. There is considerable hype within Asia on the promise of fintech as an enabler of this inclusion.</p><p>Hong Kong and Singapore are licensing new digital banks, India's UPI (unified payments interface) is reducing friction in domestic payments and China's BAT companies (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) are disrupting traditional commerce and payments, and seeking to expand in the region.</p><p>However, there is an elite focus in many of these initiatives, with the target market being the region's rising middle class rather than those at the bottom of the income ladder. Making fintech work for all will require micro-initiatives with the support of NGOs, local governments and small enterprises, with the objective of digitalizing microfinance.</p><p>Here developing Asia will again benefit from learning from each other and in building regional approaches. India's Aadhar for example, with appropriate security safeguards, is a model for Asia in terms of building digital identity.</p><p>Given differing regional and national objectives, it is difficult to imagine a global accord for digital governance any time soon. However, by signing on to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Transpacific Partnership (CPTPP, the successor to the TPP), Asia has consistently demonstrated its leadership in trade and regional governance.</p><p>This is why the region needs to come together to ensure that the promise and potential of digitalization flows evenly and equitably to the region, with the region's 3.8 billion citizens at the heart, rather than at the margins of sensible public policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123435059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-X461-DYTH-G1TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent to 3,135.32 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 shed 0.1 percent to 19,917.51. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.3 percent to 25,786.00 and Seoul's Kospi was off 0.2 percent at 2,369.51. Sydney's S...SX 200 gained 0.8 percent to 5,818.90 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,110.09. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Thailand rose while Singapore and Manila retreated.WALL STREET: U.S. stocks bounced back to record highs as investors put an end to a two-day drop for technology companies. Energy and consumer-focused companies also made outsize gains. </p><p>The Standard ...or's 500 index picked up 0.5 percent to 2,440.35. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 21,328.47. The Nasdaq composite, which has a large concentration of technology companies, rose 0.7 percent to 6,220.37. FED WATCH: The U.S. Federal Reserve ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates for the third time since December. They also are watching for the Fed's latest views on inflation and hints on how aggressive it will be in raising interest rates in the future. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]ANALYST'S TAKE: 'Despite stubbornly low inflation, the Fed is widely anticipated to lift its interest rate tomorrow,' Ric Spooner of CMC Markets said in a report. 'In a further sign that the Fed is leading a gradual global exit from monetary stimulus, Canada's Central Bank Governor last night surprised markets with hawkish comments.' CHINA: Government data showed retail sales in May rose 10.7 percent from a year earlier, a small gain over the 10.3 percent rate for the first four months of the year. Factory output rose 6.5 percent over a year earlier, holding steady at April's rate. Growth in investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets decelerated to 8.6 percent over a year earlier in the first five months of 2017, down 0.3 percentage points from the rate in January-April. BREXIT: The European Union moved to tighten its oversight of a key financial market based in London, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in Britain once the country exits the bloc. Draft regulations published by the EU executive Commission would force any clearinghouse considered important to the EU financial system to accept direct oversight from the bloc and, if requested, relocate to inside the EU. One report suggests that losing the market could cost the country 83,000 jobs, mostly in London, one of the world's top finance hubs.TECH BOUNCE: U.S. tech stocks bounced back but still are below last week's record-high prices. Facebook rose 1.5 percent to $150.68 while Microsoft gained 1.2 percent to $70.65. Hard drive maker Western Digital added 3.9 percent to $90.05. Even after their recent skid, technology companies have done much better than the rest of the market in 2017. Big tech companies like Apple and Alphabet have been responsible for a huge portion of the stock market's gains this year. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 46 cents to $46.00 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 38 cents on Tuesday to $46.46 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 42 cents to $48.30 in London. It gained 57 cents the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar declined to 110.02 yen from Tuesday's 110.04 yen. The euro gained to $1.1250 from $1.1205.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng retreated 0.2 percent to 25,804.41. Sydney's S&amp;P-ASX 200 advanced 0.9 percent to 5,826.90. Seoul's Kospi lost 0.2 percent to 2,369.84 and benchmarks in Singapore and Malaysia also retreated. New Zealand, Manila and Jakarta gained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALL STREET: U.S. stocks bounced back to record highs as investors put an end to a two-day drop for technology companies. Energy and consumer-focused companies also made outsize gains. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index picked up 0.5 percent to 2,440.35. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 21,328.47. The Nasdaq composite, which has a large concentration of technology companies, rose 0.7 percent to 6,220.37.</p><p>FED WATCH: The U.S. Federal Reserve ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates for the third time since December. They also are watching for the Fed's latest views on inflation and hints on how aggressive it will be in raising interest rates in the future.</p><p>ANALYST'S TAKE: \"Despite stubbornly low inflation, the Fed is widely anticipated to lift its interest rate tomorrow,\" said Ric Spooner of CMC Markets in a report. \"In a further sign that the Fed is leading a gradual global exit from monetary stimulus, Canada's Central Bank Governor last night surprised markets with hawkish comments.\"</p><p>CHINA: Government data showed retail sales in May rose 10.7 percent from a year earlier, a small gain over the 10.3 percent rate for the first four months of the year. Factory output rose 6.5 percent over a year earlier, holding steady at April's rate. Growth in investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets decelerated to 8.6 percent over a year earlier in the first five months of 2017, down 0.3 percentage points from the rate in January-April.</p><p>BREXIT: The European Union moved to tighten its oversight of a key financial market based in London, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in Britain once the country exits the bloc. Draft regulations published by the EU executive Commission would force any clearinghouse considered important to the EU financial system to accept direct oversight from the bloc and, if requested, relocate to inside the EU. One report suggests that losing the market could cost the country 83,000 jobs, mostly in London, one of the world's top finance hubs.</p><p>TECH BOUNCE: Though U.S. tech stocks bounced back they still are below last week's record-high prices. Facebook rose 1.5 percent to $150.68 while Microsoft gained 1.2 percent to $70.65. Hard drive maker Western Digital added 3.9 percent to $90.05. Even after their recent skid, technology companies have done much better than the rest of the market in 2017. Big tech companies like Apple and Alphabet have been responsible for a huge portion of the stock market's gains this year.</p><p>ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 46 cents to $46.00 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 38 cents on Tuesday to $46.46 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 41 cents to $48.31 a barrel in London. It gained 57 cents the previous session.</p><p>CURRENCY: The dollar declined to 110.02 yen from Tuesday's 110.04 yen. The euro gained to $1.1250 from $1.1205.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report, conducted on behalf of Temenos, is titled \"A Whole New World: How technology is driving the evolution of intelligent banking in Asia-Pacific\". It found that competition is intensifying between established retail banks and the technology and e-commerce disruptors that threaten to carve up the payment solutions market.</p><p>Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and major payment players such as WeChat Pay, Alipay and PayPal are viewed as the biggest threat to APAC bankers (60%), followed by neo-banks, like Volt Bank, Varo Money, Monzo (25%). With these threats top of mind, 37% of Asia-Pacific bankers see mastering digital marketing and engagement as their top strategic priority by 2020.</p><p>Martin Frick, Managing Director - APAC at Temenos, said:</p><p>\"Asia-Pacific bankers are acutely aware of the race they find themselves in against technology giants that have the capital and scale to take market share from established players. Neo-banks are not far behind and have the flexibility to outmaneuver major banks on the margins. To remain relevant, retain customers and appeal to the evolving demands of younger generations, banks must master digital engagement, and quickly.\"</p><p>The report also found that as digital technology regulation in Asia-Pacific catches up to the rest of the world, 37% of bankers believe that this emerging regulation in areas such as data protection and digital taxation will have a significant impact on the banking sector.</p><p>Regulation across the region has developed disparately. In Australia, open banking is being driven by the government to increase competition within established regulatory frameworks. In other parts of Asia-Pacific, such as Singapore, open banking is primarily being driven by the players themselves propelled by their desire to remain competitive and resulting in a need for retrospective regulation.</p><p>The report also points to China, where tighter licensing and data protection rules are set to diminish Alipay and WeChat Pay's duopoly across the broader region.</p><p>Key report highlights:</p><p>* New technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain are viewed as the dominant trend that will have the biggest impact on retail banks by 2025</p><p>* For 37% of respondents, emerging data regulation will have a major impact on the banking sector</p><p>* Technology and e-commerce disruptors such as Google, Alibaba and Apple are considered the biggest threat to banks (32%), followed by payment players such as PayPal, Ripple and Alipay (28%) and Neo-banks such as Volt Bank, Varo Money and Monzo (25%)</p><p>* Mastering digital marketing and engagement is the top strategic priority for banks by 2020 (37%), while migrating client usage to digital from physical channels is the top priority by 2025 (29%)</p><p>* The main concerns about open banking are the ability to capture customer data (34%) followed closely by a third-party relationship vulnerability being exploited (31%) and an inability to protect against cyber-attacks (31%)</p><p>About the survey</p><p>The Economist Intelligence Unit surveyed 400 global banking executives about the challenges retail banks expect to face between now and 2020/2025, and the strategies they are deploying in response. Fifty-one percent of respondents were at C-Suite level and 10% were board members. The APAC report was based on roughly 100 respondents from the Asia Pacific region and was supplemented with in-depth interviews with senior executives from leading banks in the region.</p><p>Source: Temenos</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0048702124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-G0N1-JB5M-W4FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009C8R</classCode><className>TEMENOS GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The shutdowns have become an irresistible option for governments of all stripes and ideological affiliations. Democratic India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Philippines are prodigious offenders. So are Asia's more repressive regimes, notably China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In their defence, governments have offered real and imagined threats to national security as reasons for shutting down the pipes. It is useful to examine these claims as well as to objectively frame the issue. Are internet shutdowns in Asia legitimate and can be defended and explained as threats to national security? Or should we take a broader approach where international law, norms, values, rights and indeed economic stability could be invoked to curb this invidious practice?</p><p>Let's start with the shutdown in Kashmir, where Indian authorities clamped down on internet access for a straight 165 days, described by rights group Access Now as the 'longest shutdown ever in a democracy'. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimates that the shutdown had huge economic costs, estimated at over 1.9 billion.</p><p>The economic cost of the continuing surveillance and shutdown in China's Xinjiang province is likely to be higher. But India is a democracy and could be a role model, which is why the recent assertion of Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravishankar Prasad is worrying. He asserted in Parliament that the Indian citizen's right to the internet was not a fundamental right. 'While right of internet is important, security of the country is equally important...Can we deny (that) the internet is abused by terrorists...?'.</p><p>The minister's primary defence of the shutdown that the internet was being abused by terrorists and others to foment unrest has some merit. Our starting point therefore is that big tech platforms should be doing a significantly better job in monitoring content and in removing material designed to provoke violence and hatred. This is the original sin and Asian governments are right to worry about messaging platforms, for example, becoming preferred channels for venom and hate speech.</p><p>To date, the big tech firms have made the right noises about monitoring and moderating content, but they have not gone far enough, providing governments with the excuse to routinely shut down access. To be blunt, self-regulation of the platforms is not working and tougher global regulation, enforcement and sanctions, possibly via the G20, would help.</p><p>At the same time, better policing of the platforms will not resolve the issue entirely because governments regard internet shutdowns as a useful way to restrict human rights and to consolidate political control and surveillance over citizens. The international community including nation-states, NGOs and the private sector needs to come together and embrace two overarching principles:</p><p>First, digital access is a fundamental human right and integrated into global declarations and norms.</p><p>Second, to protect fragmentation and Balkanization of the internet, the digital pipes which carry data across national boundaries should be embedded into international law as being part of the global commons (just like oceans are under maritime law). This would raise the bar on countries which frequently restrict digital access to their citizens.</p><p>Sensible though these recommendations might seem, it is obvious that many Asian governments would be loath to sign up to global declarations which would limit their policy options at home. There is an economic dimension to internet shutdowns, as the Kashmir case makes clear, which could be addressed by naming and shaming, just as the OECD's Financial Action Task Force does for countries falling foul of money laundering regulations. Recommendations include:</p><p>Digital access should be included in the UN's Human Development Index.</p><p>The World Bank's closely followed Doing Business Index (DBI) should score countries favourably based on their commitment to offering unimpeded access to the internet. China and India watch the DBI rankings very closely and will be forced to pursue a more liberal approach if their rankings fall precipitously.</p><p>Since internet shutdowns have a clear economic cost, particularly in payments and financial services, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should make an annual determination of member countries (as part of its surveillance mandate) of the impact of shutdowns on economic activity and financial stability.</p><p>Finally, all Asian governments have declared a public commitment to drive financial inclusion by providing digital access and identity to the poor and vulnerable. This mandate is at odds with frequent internet disruptions. A small vendor in Kashmir, Xinjiang or elsewhere in the region has limited or no recourse when the pipes are shut down. Central banks in the region need to step in by offering some level of protection, just like deposit insurance coverage.</p><p>It is clear that many of these recommendations would be rejected outright by many Asian governments. They regard internet shutdowns as part of their policy toolkit to deal with external and internal threats to national security. In pursuing such a rigid approach, governments are wilfully curbing their citizens' space for debate and ignoring a much broader issue of rights to digital access.</p><p>Armed with a hammer, it is tempting for governments to regard the internet as a nail. The international community and citizens' groups have an obligation to make such hammering very expensive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123497830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-SB01-DYTH-G20K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fintech<br/> Lendingkart secures US$4.7 million in debt funding (India). The online lender for small businesses netted the capital from FMO, the Netherlands' development bank. This follows US$3.8 million debt funding from Indian bank SBI in December last year. Lendingkart also got a US$10.9 million investment from Sistema Asia Fund, Bertelsmann India Investment, Mayfield India, Saama Capital, and others in September. It plans to use the new funds to grow its loan book. (Inc42)</p><p><br/> New cryptocurrency mining startup gets US$1 million from Fatfish Internet (Malaysia). Australian investor Fatfish will obtain 51 percent of APAC Mining. The startup, which manages, leases, and invests in cryptocurrency mining hardware, will launch in two locations in Malaysia later this month. It plans to take advantage of favorable local electricity prices to mine Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether. (Fatfish)<br/> Line seeks to integrate cryptocurrencies (Japan). The messaging app is in discussions with multiple potential partners - including South Korean token exchange Upbit - to enable cryptocurrency transactions through its payments platform, Line Pay. It hopes the move can help slow the exodus of users in its key markets: Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. (Bloomberg)<br/>Paytm launches wealth management unit with US$10 million funding (India).

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea has reported 113 new cases of COVID-19, its first daily increase over 100 in five days, as the country entered a holiday break that officials fear would possibly worsen transmissions. The numbers released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Wednesday brought the caseload to 23,812, including 413 deaths. </p><p>Eighty-one of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, where health workers have struggled to stem transmissions linked to various sources, including churches, medical facilities, restaurants, schools and workers. The newest cluster of infections is a mental hospital in northern Seoul where at least 30 have been infected. Twenty of the new cases were tied to international arrivals. Officials have called for citizen vigilance ahead of the Chuseok harvest festival that began Wednesday and continues through the weekend. While millions of South Koreans travel during Chuseok every year to visit relatives, officials have pleaded that people stay home to help stem transmissions. Nightclubs, bars, buffet restaurants and other establishments deemed as 'high-risk' will be shut in Seoul during the holiday period to reduce gatherings. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region: \u2014 North Korea called on governments to 'display effective leadership' in the fight against COVID-19 and said its own measures against the pandemic ensured it had the threat 'under safe and stable control.' Kim Song, the country's U.N. ambassador, said a tightly administered anti-pandemic effort in his nation had been working. North Korea strictly regulates foreign visitors and filters all information through its state propaganda apparatus, with details about its approach to the coronavirus relatively scant. 'A series of state measures are now being taken to block the virus inflow into the country, and all people adhere strictly to anti-epidemic regulations while maintaining the highest alert,' he said. Separately, state media reported the nation's leader Kim Jong Un had presided over a Politburo meeting where officials warned against complacency and addressed unspecified problems in the anti-virus campaign.

Those four words should be taped to the computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a discount. View the \"7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale\"[2].

The Supreme Court's decision allowing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed is relatively narrow, but today's technology titans have reason to be nervous nonetheless. </p><p>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh sided with his four liberal colleagues Monday to let device owners challenge Apple over the way it allows iPhone and iPad users to download apps only through its proprietary store - and then takes a commission on some of the sales. The ruling is less dramatic than it may sound: It's up to a lower court to determine whether Apple or its store holds a monopoly in any market, as well as whether the firm is abusing its position. Still, a conservative justice's willingness to entertain a rethinking of antitrust policy in the digital age is a surprise, and a signal.</p><p>Antitrust advocates argue that the regime around competition today lags behind the times. Network effects help large companies grow larger while keeping little ones out, and every piece of data acquired makes the last millions or billions of pieces more valuable. The most ardent crusaders for regulation say focusing only on whether consumers are immediately being charged higher prices will not be enough to rein in the tech industry's power players. In that sense, the court's opinion is more of the same. It asks whether Apple's commission policy leads developers to recoup what they lose by making users pay more.</p><p>Other aspects of the ruling, however, are surprisingly forward-thinking. By determining that consumers can have a direct purchasing relationship with a platform even when they are buying third-party products, the court blurs the line that companies have held so far: that they are neutral intermediaries. And the additional acknowledgment that the third parties might also bring a case for any harm that Apple causes them in its role not as a dominant supplier of apps but as a dominant buyer - a \"monopsony\" rather than a monopoly - opens up another front for litigation.</p><p>Apple has a robust argument for why it should remain beyond regulatory reach. Its software runs on less than half of U.S. smartphones and a much smaller share of smartphones worldwide. Opponents say that does not matter because Apple still has a stranglehold on apps that run on its devices. (Plus, iPhone users are much bigger spenders than their Android-customer counterparts.) Figuring out what market a company has a monopoly in, if any, is a difficult enterprise. Figuring out whether that company is unfairly leveraging its role to hurt consumers or snuff out any potential competition can be thornier still. But before this week, it looked as though these fights might never have a chance to occur when it came to tech companies. Now, a battle has begun.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-d3e28c82-7688-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W46-TJH1-JBFW-C0SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 16, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The Supreme Court\u2019s decision allowing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed is relatively narrow, but today\u2019s technology titans have reason to be nervous nonetheless. </p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh sided with his four liberal colleagues Monday to let device owners challenge Apple over the way it allows iPhone and iPad users to download apps only through its proprietary store - and then takes a commission on some of the sales. </p><p>The ruling is less dramatic than it may sound: It\u2019s up to a lower court to determine whether Apple or its store holds a monopoly in any market, as well as whether the firm is abusing its position. Still, a conservative justice\u2019s willingness to entertain a rethinking of antitrust policy in the digital age is a surprise, and a signal. </p><p>Antitrust advocates argue that the regime around competition today lags behind the times. Network effects help large companies grow larger while keeping little ones out, and every piece of data acquired makes the last millions or billions of pieces more valuable. The most ardent crusaders for regulation say focusing only on whether consumers are immediately being charged higher prices will not be enough to rein in the tech industry\u2019s power players. </p><p>In that sense, the court\u2019s opinion is more of the same. It asks whether Apple\u2019s commission policy leads developers to recoup what they lose by making users pay more. </p><p>Other aspects of the ruling, however, are surprisingly forward-thinking. By determining that consumers can have a direct purchasing relationship with a platform even when they are buying third-party products, the court blurs the line that companies have held so far: that they are neutral intermediaries. </p><p>And the additional acknowledgment that the third parties might also bring a case for any harm that Apple causes them in its role not as a dominant supplier of apps but as a dominant buyer - a \u201cmonopsony\u201d rather than a monopoly - opens up another front for litigation. </p><p>Apple has a robust argument for why it should remain beyond regulatory reach. Its software runs on less than half of U.S. smartphones and a much smaller share of smartphones worldwide. Opponents say that does not matter because Apple still has a stranglehold on apps that run on its devices. (Plus, iPhone users are much bigger spenders than their Android-customer counterparts.) Figuring out what market a company has a monopoly in, if any, is a difficult enterprise. </p><p>Figuring out whether that company is unfairly leveraging its role to hurt consumers or snuff out any potential competition can be thornier still. But before this week, it looked as though these fights might never have a chance to occur when it came to tech companies. Now, a battle has begun. </p><p>\u2014The Washington Post </p><p>CREDIT: THE WASHINGTON POST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYWOS-2227403491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYWOS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5Y-RGP1-JBHT-D2DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322651</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Record May 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Daily Record;

On September 10th Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming boss, set out her priorities: managing the transition from fossil fuels, extra dollops of American big-tech bashing and 'upgrading our unique social market economy'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first two at least have the benefit of being clear. On the economy, however, Europe needs a lot more than blather. In the past decade the trend of economic integration that defined post-war Europe has gone backwards. The 'single market', once breathtaking in its ambition to eliminate all internal EU barriers for goods, services, capital and people, has failed to keep up with the economies it was trying to shape. If Europe wants to create prosperity and world-beating firms, it needs not just to reinvigorate the single market, but also to rediscover that original vision in neglected areas of trade such as services.</p><p>The single market still matters-look at the mess Britain finds itself in as it tries to extricate itself from the EU. But a policy originally devised to break down trade barriers in the era of coal and steel has not adapted fast enough to the era of bits and likes (see Briefing). In the past decade Europe's banks have retrenched to their home markets and its firms have shifted their energies to expanding outside the EU. As a result, Europe still looks like a series of mid-sized economies patched together, not a single rival to China and America.</p><p>That is one reason why, even as central bankers administer a drip-feed of monetary adrenalin, Europe's economy is losing ground to global rivals. It risks becoming a business backwater. A decade ago ten of the world's 40 largest listed firms by market value were based in the EU; now only two are-in 32nd and 36th place. Desperately few of the world's leading startups are European.</p><p>Policymakers who ache at the absence of a European tech success on the scale of Google or Amazon pay lip service to the importance of the single market. And yet France and Germany argue that the real answer is dirigiste indus</p><p>trial policy. They have called for mergers of European firms to create industrial 'champions' shielded from antitrust rules and Chinese competition.</p><p>They should be aiming to complete the single market instead. A functional single market helps firms achieve economies of scale. It is cheaper to make a product that has to meet one set of EU regulations than to try to follow 28 different national rulebooks. Stiffer competition from firms across the continent means that shoppers get better and cheaper stuff. Imagine if the dozens of mobile operators in Europe were free to pitch their data plans to those beyond their national borders. Instead, consumers have to make do with higher-charging local oligopolies.</p><p>Innovation spreads faster in a unified market, pepping up productivity. A properly integrated energy grid would boost the most efficient (and greenest) power producers. Banks with loans out across the continent avoid trouble if their home market falls into recession. Capital markets on a continental scale can help them distribute risks beyond the banking sector. Safer banks and deeper markets mean cheaper capital and fewer bail-outs.</p><p>For all those reasons, reinvigorating the single market ought to be at the centre of the debate on how to boost Europe's economy. It is not. Since her appointment two months ago Mrs von der Leyen has mentioned the single market only in passing ( see article). The commissioner in charge of the brief, Sylvie Goulard of France, is well regarded, but will have to split her time between internal-market duties, regulating artificial intelligence, and a new defence-industry and space brief.</p><p>That might be understandable if the single market were beyond saving. In fact it can be revitalised in three ways. The first is to ensure that its statutes are fully implemented. Too often, national governments flout the edicts of the single market so as to protect a politically connected industry. On average, each European country regulates the workings of nearly 200 professions, making it needlessly tricky for Europeans to move to where the jobs are. No wonder bits of the continent still have double-digit unemployment. The new Brussels team should step up enforcement against governments that fail to apply the rules.</p><p>The second way is to focus on the euro. The single currency is in some ways an extension of the single market, even if fewer countries belong to it. It would be more stable if a central fund insured bank deposits. A more substantial euro-zone budget, focused on unemployment insurance, say, could help integrate euro-zone economies. As an added benefit, this would also deepen cross-border links, notably by helping banks become truly European. Here, Mrs von der Leyen has a harder task. Her native Germany will seek to keep progress glacial.</p><p>Most ambitious would be a fresh push to remove what structural barriers remain to cross-border European trade. Collecting value-added tax in a neighbouring country would not be so daunting for small businesses if the levy was structured in the same way across Europe, for example. Banks would pitch their wares more broadly if bankruptcy laws were harmonised, and a proper capital-markets union created. Standard contracts for business services (on professional liability, say) would make it easier for German accountants to tout for business in Italy, or for Spanish architects to pitch their offerings beyond the Pyrenees.</p><p>A grand bargain of policies serving up tax reform, services liberalisation and a more robust euro would run into plenty of national red lines. But each country would also have lots to gain. Europe needs to shield itself from the fallout a global trade war might bring. It needs a vision after the departure of Britain, the single market's most reliable champion in Brussels-but also, often, a brake on ambitious projects. Meanwhile, Britons tempted to say good riddance to the single market's frustrations should reflect on how much losing a seat at the table could cost them.</p><p>Jacques Delors, a former head of the European Commission who championed closer integration, rightly pointed out that 'nobody can fall in love with the single market'. There is nothing flashy about reworking bankruptcy rules or tax regimes. But Europe's greatest economic project is half- finished business, yielding just half the benefits it could. Europe has few such obvious levers to pull to boost its economy. Time to tug on this one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY16092019000528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2R-7VY1-JCH9-G0KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1097\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He has sought a meeting with Republican Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), each of whom have questioned the app's independence from Beijing.</p><p>Zhu is also expected to connect with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has pressed TikTok to better protect children online, her office confirmed. Axios previously reported about Zhu's plans to meet with Blackburn.</p><p>In advance of the visit, TikTok's recently expanded team of lobbyists has made the rounds on Capitol Hill, seeking to stress that the social media app is not capitulating to censors in Beijing and protects users' data from the Chinese government.</p><p>But they face heavy doubt from some lawmakers who say that TikTok may have to separate itself completely from its parent, the Chinese tech conglomerate ByteDance, if it truly wants to win Washington's trust.</p><p>'It's difficult to see a way forward for TikTok without a complete separation from its Beijing-based owner,' Cotton said in a statement to The Washington Post.</p><p>TikTok declined to comment.</p><p>TikTok began the year as a gilded viral hitmaker, the rare new social app to best far-larger rivals, convince young users of its coolness and pierce the online mainstream. But it will end the year embattled on all sides: scrutinized by regulators, pummeled by competitors and increasingly questioned by an audience worried over censorship and foreign control.</p><p>The app's leaders stoked some lawmakers' ire last month by skipping a congressional hearing chaired by Hawley probing its ties to China. And its parent company faces an investigation by an arm of the federal government that reviews foreign business deals for national-security concerns.</p><p>TikTok executives' foray to stodgy Washington could seem surprisingly off-brand: The app has been downloaded on more than 1-billion phones around the world largely due to a stream of crafty, energetic and unconventionally funny videos that young audiences love to share.</p><p>But the growing doubts about its approach to content moderation and privacy have forced TikTok to travel the same well-trod path through Washington as its big tech predecessors, including Facebook and Google \" a task made tougher due to its Chinese ties.</p><p>Suspicions of censorship on TikTok reached a fever pitch last month, when a 17-year-old high school student, Feroza Aziz, said her account had been suspended following her posting of a viral video drawing attention to China's detention camps for Muslims in Xinjiang.</p><p>The company first attributed the penalty to a previous satirical video she had posted, then later acknowledged it had briefly taken down her video about China due to a 'human moderation error.' Still, the incident emboldened critics who remain unconvinced by TikTok's assurances that U.S. moderators, not Chinese censors, review U.S. users' videos.</p><p>Former TikTok employees told The Post last month that their content-moderation decisions were largely in the hands of Chinese regulators, who demoted or removed content related to a wide range of U.S. social and political topics.</p><p>Leaked content-moderation guidelines published by The Guardian and the German blog Netzpolitik also found that the company had urged moderators to suppress videos including political criticism or people with disabilities. TikTok said the measures were a blunt and misguided approach to encouraging positivity and preventing bullying on the app, and that the company had updated its rules with 'more nuanced' protections for speech.</p><p>The app's parent company, ByteDance, has long professed its pride in being a tech conglomerate with Chinese roots. But it has also encountered resistance for hosting content that dissatisfied strict regulators in Beijing.</p><p>The Chinese government has blocked major Western websites across the world's second-largest economy, and it has far-reaching powers to access data and compel obedience from companies working within its borders.</p><p>ByteDance last year shut down a popular comedy app that included jokes deemed inappropriate by Chinese censors. In a long apology, ByteDance's billionaire founder, Zhang Yiming, vowed to fall in line with government demands, saying the company's problems sprung from 'deficiencies in education on the socialist core values and deviation from public opinion guidance.'</p><p>He also credited the Chinese Communist Party for the company's massive growth, saying, 'We profoundly understand that our rapid development was an opportunity afforded us by this great era.'</p><p>That close link to communist authority has become a major hurdle for TikTok's attempts to prove its independence and sidestep government scrutiny in the United States. Lawmakers have suggested the company could pose a threat to Americans' data privacy and free-speech rights.</p><p>The U.S. government, through its Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., is examining the deal that birthed TikTok, ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly in 2017, for potential national-security risks. The government panel has sweeping authority and could, if it wanted, push the Chinese company to sell TikTok, citing the threat of Americans' personal data in foreign control.</p><p>Cotton and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) in October urged U.S. intelligence officials to determine whether the app posed a 'potential counterintelligence threat.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:drew.harwell@washpost.com\">drew.harwell@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-fd69b560-17b1-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNR-1N71-JBFW-C337-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

He has sought a meeting with Republican Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), each of whom have questioned the app's independence from Beijing.</p><p>Zhu is also expected to connect with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has pressed TikTok to better protect children online, her office confirmed. Axios previously reported about Zhu's plans to meet with Blackburn.</p><p>In advance of the visit, TikTok's recently expanded team of lobbyists has made the rounds on Capitol Hill, seeking to stress that the social media app is not capitulating to censors in Beijing and protects users' data from the Chinese government.</p><p>But they face heavy doubt from some lawmakers who say that TikTok may have to separate itself completely from its parent, the Chinese tech conglomerate ByteDance, if it truly wants to win Washington's trust.</p><p>'It's difficult to see a way forward for TikTok without a complete separation from its Beijing-based owner,' Cotton said in a statement to The Washington Post.</p><p>TikTok declined to comment.</p><p>TikTok began the year as a gilded viral hitmaker, the rare new social app to best far-larger rivals, convince young users of its coolness and pierce the online mainstream. But it will end the year embattled on all sides: scrutinized by regulators, pummeled by competitors and increasingly questioned by an audience worried over censorship and foreign control.</p><p>The app's leaders stoked some lawmakers' ire last month by skipping a congressional hearing chaired by Hawley probing its ties to China. And its parent company faces an investigation by an arm of the federal government that reviews foreign business deals for national-security concerns.</p><p>TikTok executives' foray to stodgy Washington could seem surprisingly off-brand: The app has been downloaded on more than 1-billion phones around the world largely due to a stream of crafty, energetic and unconventionally funny videos that young audiences love to share.</p><p>But the growing doubts about its approach to content moderation and privacy have forced TikTok to travel the same well-trod path through Washington as its big tech predecessors, including Facebook and Google \" a task made tougher due to its Chinese ties.</p><p>Suspicions of censorship on TikTok reached a fever pitch last month, when a 17-year-old high school student, Feroza Aziz, said her account had been suspended following her posting of a viral video drawing attention to China's detention camps for Muslims in Xinjiang.</p><p>The company first attributed the penalty to a previous satirical video she had posted, then later acknowledged it had briefly taken down her video about China due to a 'human moderation error.' Still, the incident emboldened critics who remain unconvinced by TikTok's assurances that U.S. moderators, not Chinese censors, review U.S. users' videos.</p><p>Former TikTok employees told The Post last month that their content-moderation decisions were largely in the hands of Chinese regulators, who demoted or removed content related to a wide range of U.S. social and political topics.</p><p>Leaked content-moderation guidelines published by The Guardian and the German blog Netzpolitik also found that the company had urged moderators to suppress videos including political criticism or people with disabilities. TikTok said the measures were a blunt and misguided approach to encouraging positivity and preventing bullying on the app, and that the company had updated its rules with 'more nuanced' protections for speech.</p><p>The app's parent company, ByteDance, has long professed its pride in being a tech conglomerate with Chinese roots. But it has also encountered resistance for hosting content that dissatisfied strict regulators in Beijing.</p><p>The Chinese government has blocked major Western websites across the world's second-largest economy, and it has far-reaching powers to access data and compel obedience from companies working within its borders.</p><p>ByteDance last year shut down a popular comedy app that included jokes deemed inappropriate by Chinese censors. In a long apology, ByteDance's billionaire founder, Zhang Yiming, vowed to fall in line with government demands, saying the company's problems sprung from 'deficiencies in education on the socialist core values and deviation from public opinion guidance.'</p><p>He also credited the Chinese Communist Party for the company's massive growth, saying, 'We profoundly understand that our rapid development was an opportunity afforded us by this great era.'</p><p>That close link to communist authority has become a major hurdle for TikTok's attempts to prove its independence and sidestep government scrutiny in the United States. Lawmakers have suggested the company could pose a threat to Americans' data privacy and free-speech rights.</p><p>The U.S. government, through its Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., is examining the deal that birthed TikTok, ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly in 2017, for potential national-security risks. The government panel has sweeping authority and could, if it wanted, push the Chinese company to sell TikTok, citing the threat of Americans' personal data in foreign control.</p><p>Cotton and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) in October urged U.S. intelligence officials to determine whether the app posed a 'potential counterintelligence threat.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:drew.harwell@washpost.com\">drew.harwell@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-fd69b56017b111ea91103b34ce1d92b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNP-WX41-DYX1-H4GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>1:23 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

I wasn't concerned that the government was about to take away my beloved gadgets. Instead, I was reminded how much the devices I rely on every day reflect the unique concentration of corporate power, and the lack of competition, that excites the passions of politicians on both sides of the aisle. More and more, it seems, our digital devices and services offer only the figment of choice, without delivering on the technoutopian promise of democratization of wealth and influence. The result: a tech industry dominated by a handful of corporations whose value and reach only grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ubiquity of those companies and their products makes antitrust investigations into a cause for celebration. But those same inquiries may prove fruitless for the very reason that they feel so necessary: Difficult as it is pull ourselves away from Big Tech, would it really be feasible to pull it apart?</p><p> I recently acquired a laptop made by Microsoft - a company whose market capitalization reached a dizzying $1 trillion earlier this year, joining superheavyweights like Amazon and Apple. (Google, another prime target of the antitrust investigation, has yet to breach the trillion-dollar mark.) In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Microsoft was famously the target of a grinding antitrust suit, premised largely on its inclusion of its Internet Explorer web browser in the Windows operating system. Microsoft lost the suit, but it later settled with the government and continued its forward march to market dominance. In retrospect, the whole affair can seem almost laughable - a foolhardy attempt to stem the monopolistic rise of a new corporate giant. When I bought a Microsoft laptop last month, I found it difficult (though not impossible) to change its default browser to something other than Microsoft's Edge. Even after I set my preference to Firefox, the operating system still regularly prompts me to use Edge, and some links open in Microsoft's browser. Microsoft not only survived its antitrust suit; its software and services are more integrated into its operating system than ever before.</p><p> The point is less to dwell on the picayune details of what was once known as the \"browser wars\" than to show how hard it is to escape the hold these companies' ecosystems has on our lives. My phone is made by Google, whose global surveillance apparatus instills jealousy in the hearts of intelligence professionals everywhere and whose services, from Maps to Gmail to Search, have become integral parts of daily life. The chat apps I use are mostly owned by Facebook, which has been furiously working to integrate the back-end systems of WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, possibly in an effort to complicate breaking up the parent company. I shop on Amazon, whose massive portfolio extends from a global e-commerce powerhouse to groceries, digital video, logistics, health care and even a planned network of thousands of satellites. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p> The rise of Big Tech has reaped spectacular riches for a select group - and arguably has made our lives more efficient and convenient - but it has also corralled us into an economy dominated by a handful of corporations that, thanks to a fortuitous series of loopholes, pay almost no taxes in the United States. What was once a group of upstart incumbents has matured into an ossified industry controlled by a few major players. While the tech industry has long celebrated the form of creative destruction known as disruption, it seems unlikely that any startup will be able to unseat, much less compete against, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple or Microsoft. For these reasons, we should celebrate a rigorous government effort to chart how these companies came to dominate the technology industry.</p><p> There are some good reasons to be skeptical of the potential efficacy of the antitrust probe. For one thing, they take a long time and can lead to less than satisfying results. Years of lean budgets, poor hiring and criticism from both major parties have helped create an impression of the government as a feckless regulator. But worrying about outcomes is not a reason to abandon a worthwhile process. Corporate power isn't curbed with simply a wish or a song - or an op-ed, for that matter. It is done, on the government side, through the hard, deliberative work of investigating, issuing subpoenas, calling hearings and digging deep into the operations of these companies.</p><p> Still, we should be mindful of past examples, Microsoft included. After a 10-year battle with the government, in 1984, AT&amp;T agreed to divest from and break up the\"Baby Bells,\" regional carriers that underwrote much of the company's telecommunications dominance. But in the following decades, the Baby Bells, like some \"Terminator\" villain, reconstituted themselves, eventually reforming as - yep - AT&amp;T. (A similar phenomenon took place after the breakup, more than 100 years ago, of Standard Oil.) Today, AT&amp;T is once again one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. It is also a reminder of one of the major oversights of the recently announced Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission investigation: the refusal to look at the big telecoms, which have regional monopolies and, through various acquisitions like Verizon's takeover of Yahoo, are increasingly controlling both how we connect to the internet and what we see. If Silicon Valley is to be first under the microscope, the telecoms should be next.</p><p> We can expect the tech giants to throw everything they have at these investigations - fleets of lawyers, packs of lobbyists, oodles of political donations, and any amount of wheedling and cajoling. They will plead innocence or argue for the value of self-regulation, a mythical concept with no foundation in law or governance. They will proclaim their belief in innovation and competition. They will promise - despite all evidence to the contrary - that they are mature stewards of our personal data. Tech leaders, like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, will tout the virtues of privacy - a bizarre about-face for someone who once implied that privacy was \"no longer a social norm\" largely obsolete and whose company's tremendous profits are generated by industrial-scale surveillance of its users.</p><p> We should believe none of it. These investigations are well past due. And while we may be dubious of their efficacy - breaking up a trillion-dollar conglomerate is no small matter - that is no reason not to press forward. Our politicians may inspire little hope that they work for the public good, rather than to perpetuate their own cushy positions of authority. But here they've landed on something important. For too long, the tech giants have been allowed to steamroll their way over legacy industries, to insinuate themselves into more and more of daily life, often without our consent. It's time to do something about it. An antitrust probe is a worthy starting point.</p><p>           Jacob Silverman is the author of \"Terms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\"    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4411286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DB50F347E1 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9H-P3R1-JBCN-4171-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1199\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Milford Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I wasn't concerned that the government was about to take away my beloved gadgets. Instead, I was reminded how much the devices I rely on every day reflect the unique concentration of corporate power, and the lack of competition, that excites the passions of politicians on both sides of the aisle. More and more, it seems, our digital devices and services offer only the figment of choice, without delivering on the technoutopian promise of democratization of wealth and influence. The result: a tech industry dominated by a handful of corporations whose value and reach only grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ubiquity of those companies and their products makes antitrust investigations into a cause for celebration. But those same inquiries may prove fruitless for the very reason that they feel so necessary: Difficult as it is pull ourselves away from Big Tech, would it really be feasible to pull it apart?</p><p> I recently acquired a laptop made by Microsoft - a company whose market capitalization reached a dizzying $1 trillion earlier this year, joining superheavyweights like Amazon and Apple. (Google, another prime target of the antitrust investigation, has yet to breach the trillion-dollar mark.) In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Microsoft was famously the target of a grinding antitrust suit, premised largely on its inclusion of its Internet Explorer web browser in the Windows operating system. Microsoft lost the suit, but it later settled with the government and continued its forward march to market dominance. In retrospect, the whole affair can seem almost laughable - a foolhardy attempt to stem the monopolistic rise of a new corporate giant. When I bought a Microsoft laptop last month, I found it difficult (though not impossible) to change its default browser to something other than Microsoft's Edge. Even after I set my preference to Firefox, the operating system still regularly prompts me to use Edge, and some links open in Microsoft's browser. Microsoft not only survived its antitrust suit; its software and services are more integrated into its operating system than ever before.</p><p> The point is less to dwell on the picayune details of what was once known as the \"browser wars\" than to show how hard it is to escape the hold these companies' ecosystems has on our lives. My phone is made by Google, whose global surveillance apparatus instills jealousy in the hearts of intelligence professionals everywhere and whose services, from Maps to Gmail to Search, have become integral parts of daily life. The chat apps I use are mostly owned by Facebook, which has been furiously working to integrate the back-end systems of WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, possibly in an effort to complicate breaking up the parent company. I shop on Amazon, whose massive portfolio extends from a global e-commerce powerhouse to groceries, digital video, logistics, health care and even a planned network of thousands of satellites. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p> The rise of Big Tech has reaped spectacular riches for a select group - and arguably has made our lives more efficient and convenient - but it has also corralled us into an economy dominated by a handful of corporations that, thanks to a fortuitous series of loopholes, pay almost no taxes in the United States. What was once a group of upstart incumbents has matured into an ossified industry controlled by a few major players. While the tech industry has long celebrated the form of creative destruction known as disruption, it seems unlikely that any startup will be able to unseat, much less compete against, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple or Microsoft. For these reasons, we should celebrate a rigorous government effort to chart how these companies came to dominate the technology industry.</p><p> There are some good reasons to be skeptical of the potential efficacy of the antitrust probe. For one thing, they take a long time and can lead to less than satisfying results. Years of lean budgets, poor hiring and criticism from both major parties have helped create an impression of the government as a feckless regulator. But worrying about outcomes is not a reason to abandon a worthwhile process. Corporate power isn't curbed with simply a wish or a song - or an op-ed, for that matter. It is done, on the government side, through the hard, deliberative work of investigating, issuing subpoenas, calling hearings and digging deep into the operations of these companies.</p><p> Still, we should be mindful of past examples, Microsoft included. After a 10-year battle with the government, in 1984, AT&amp;T agreed to divest from and break up the\"Baby Bells,\" regional carriers that underwrote much of the company's telecommunications dominance. But in the following decades, the Baby Bells, like some \"Terminator\" villain, reconstituted themselves, eventually reforming as - yep - AT&amp;T. (A similar phenomenon took place after the breakup, more than 100 years ago, of Standard Oil.) Today, AT&amp;T is once again one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. It is also a reminder of one of the major oversights of the recently announced Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission investigation: the refusal to look at the big telecoms, which have regional monopolies and, through various acquisitions like Verizon's takeover of Yahoo, are increasingly controlling both how we connect to the internet and what we see. If Silicon Valley is to be first under the microscope, the telecoms should be next.</p><p> We can expect the tech giants to throw everything they have at these investigations - fleets of lawyers, packs of lobbyists, oodles of political donations, and any amount of wheedling and cajoling. They will plead innocence or argue for the value of self-regulation, a mythical concept with no foundation in law or governance. They will proclaim their belief in innovation and competition. They will promise - despite all evidence to the contrary - that they are mature stewards of our personal data. Tech leaders, like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, will tout the virtues of privacy - a bizarre about-face for someone who once implied that privacy was \"no longer a social norm\" largely obsolete and whose company's tremendous profits are generated by industrial-scale surveillance of its users.</p><p> We should believe none of it. These investigations are well past due. And while we may be dubious of their efficacy - breaking up a trillion-dollar conglomerate is no small matter - that is no reason not to press forward. Our politicians may inspire little hope that they work for the public good, rather than to perpetuate their own cushy positions of authority. But here they've landed on something important. For too long, the tech giants have been allowed to steamroll their way over legacy industries, to insinuate themselves into more and more of daily life, often without our consent. It's time to do something about it. An antitrust probe is a worthy starting point.</p><p>           Jacob Silverman is the author of \"Terms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\"    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4411285</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DB50F347E1 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9H-P3R1-JBCN-417N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1199\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Milford Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

New announcements, particularly those from Apple, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smartcompany.com.au/technology/43662-apple-s-iphone-6-announcement-a-victory-for-hype-over-innovation-control-shift.html\">are nearly inescapable</url>. But what goes on in the lead-up to these big product reveals?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a mobile phone from the drawing board to a finished  product in stores takes around 12 to 18 months. However, it can take  significantly longer for new product categories, designs, or if a major  rewrite of a device's operating system is involved.</p><p>One aspect of the process a lot of people don't fully  appreciate is that developing a prototype of a product is a very  different proposition to putting it into mass production.</p><p>It might be possible for a team of four or five engineers to  hand-build a prototype of a device, or a small number of units.  However, coming up with a design that can be produced cheaply and  efficiently on a factory floor in volumes of a million units or more  with a low defect rate is a whole different ball game.</p><p>Back in the early 1980s, for example, engineers at now  defunct computer manufacturer Commodore figured out how to create a  working touch screen for the venerable Commodore 64. Unfortunately, with  technology and manufacturing techniques standing as they did back then,  mass producing a touchscreen monitor was simply not financially viable.</p><p>A low defect rate is an especially important consideration  when refining a design for production, because the working units need to  be sold with enough margin to cover the cost of any defective units  that need to be thrown away.</p><p>For example, one of the big innovations that made the 1980s home computer revolution was that a company called <url normalizedValue=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502\">MOS Technologies</url> worked out a way to significantly reduce the defect rate of its  processors. This, in turn, made it possible to put these processors into  a range of low-cost consumer devices, from the original Apple II to the  Atari 2600, BBC Micro B and Nintendo NES, where these devices would not  have been viable otherwise.</p><p>Likewise, where it might be possible to custom manufacture a  mould for a prototype at a local tool shop; this is not an option for  mass-produced tech devices. So each component of a device also needs to  be put into mass production, before the pieces can be assembled into a  finished product and shipped.</p><p>So often, a group of engineers at a company will first  prototype a new design, then it will be refined ahead of a small test  run of \"engineering samples\" where the device's design will be refined  to make it easier to manufacture, before it gets placed into full  production.</p><p>Along the way, new mobile phones need to go through a  rigorous process of tests from mobile phone carriers (after all, if  there are issues with a phone, they want to know about it before they  offer them subsidised on a plan) and government regulators. Often in  multiple countries, and sometimes requiring devices to be modified as a  result.</p><p>Of course, no one wants to buy a new device, only to find  there is no content that runs on it. That's why in the middle of the  year, before the big tech releases, most tech companies run developer  conferences where new platforms and developer kits are unveiled. They  want the tools to be in the hands of developers and content in the store  before it reaches consumers.</p><p>Finally, device manufacturers need to manufacture enough  components and assemble them into finished devices in order to fill up  their supply channel. Managing the logistics of this is a nightmare in  and of itself.</p><p>Because of the length of the process, companies will often  have the next iteration of a device somewhere in the pipeline even as  the latest model is being released. While it all sounds so easy in  theory, in practice - being technology - something goes horribly wrong.</p><p>Somewhere along this long and risk-filled process, the new  device will be introduced to the public. How far that official  announcement takes place carries with it both risks and opportunities  for the company developing the product.</p><p>For example, during the 1980s, a company called Osborne  Computer Corporation announced their next model a full year before it  was introduced to the market. Understandably, consumers waited until the  new, more powerful model came out rather than buying the existing  model. In a chain of events known as \"the Osborne effect\", its sales  eventually tanked and the company filed for bankruptcy as a result.</p><p>On the other hand, an early announcement of a forthcoming  product can also be used to get consumers to hold off from buying a  competitor's existing product. This is a tactic known as \"fear,  uncertainty and doubt\" or FUD, and is precisely what Apple is attempting  by announcing its smartwatch before it's ready to hit stores, while  competitors such as LG, Samsung and Motorola have already begun selling  theirs.</p><p>Of course, if your company can keep a secret, another option  is announcing a new product late in the process, just as it's about to  hit stores. This can mean your competitors spend 18 months scrambling on  R&amp;D while you have the market to yourself. If you ever wondered why  Apple is so secretive, this is why.</p><p>Finally, \"accidentally\" leaking details to selected tech  reporters in the lead-up to your big announcement is always a good  option. This way, you can spread FUD about some aspects of your  competitor's products (for example, those persistent \"Apple's next phone  will have a big screen too\" rumours leading up to the iPhone 6) without  an official announcement that can damage your current ones.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This story originally appeared on</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smartcompany.com.au\">SmartCompany.</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SSMART-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SSMART2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D6J-D131-F0NT-H11X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><timeReceived>2:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>StartUpSmart</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50626\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 18, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS339930 DOLL, TOY &amp;

The Daily Beast reported[2] that emergency services were called to different Amazon warehouses around the US at least 189 times between October 2013 and October 2018 to respond to workers' \"suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental health episodes.\" An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider that the company offers employees \"comprehensive medical care starting on day one so employees have access to the care when they need it most.\" Some Amazon employees are reportedly experiencing emotional distress in the workplace and threatening self-harm. </p><p>An investigationfrom The Daily Beast[3] found that \"emergency workers were summoned to Amazon warehouses at least 189 times for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental health episodes\" between October 2013 and October 2018, at 46 fulfillment centers around the United States. The Daily Beast's report was based on interviews with current and former employees and a review of 911 call logs and police records. \"It's this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence,\" former Amazon employee Jace Crouch told the Daily Beast. An anonymous employee told the Daily Beast that the company treated its workers like \"robots.\" The Daily Beast noted that its report was \"not evidence that Amazon staffers experience suicidal episodes more often than other American workers, in or out of a warehouse.\" And the rate of suicide in the United States is on the rise \u2014 the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention estimated[4] that there were 1.4 million suicide attempts in the US in 2017. Amazon disputes this characterization of its work culture and notes that it offers employees a number of resources when it comes to mental health. \"The physical and mental well-being of our associates is our top priority, and we are proud of both our efforts and overall success in this area,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. \"We provide comprehensive medical care starting on day one so employees have access to the care when they need it most, 24-hour a day free and confidential counseling services, and various leave and medical accommodation options covering both mental and physical health concerns.\" Read more: Amazon warehouse employees speak out about the 'brutal' reality of working during the holidays, when 60-hour weeks are mandatory and ambulance calls are common[5] But this isn't the first report to paint a picture of difficult working conditions at Amazon. Employees have spoken[6] to Business Insider about feeling like \"robots\" due to intense surveillance in the warehouses, while others described how their coworkers would urinate in trash cans because they didn't have enough time to rush to the bathroom. Investigative journalist James Bloodworth worked undercover[7] in an Amazon warehouse in the UK. He told[8] Business Insider: \"The atmosphere is what I imagine a prison feels like. You felt like you were walking on eggshells.\" Business Insider also previously interviewed[9] 30 current and former Amazon employees about what it's like to work at the company during the holiday rush. One employee called the company's peak season \"brutal,\" while others described working long shifts that left them in physical pain.To read the full report, head to The Daily Beast.[10] NOW WATCH:
