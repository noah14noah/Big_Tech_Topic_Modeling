Though that practice \u2014 which security experts said left users vulnerable to identity theft \u2014 ended in May 2016, Facebookcontinued to gain access to the email address books of at least 1.5 million new users.</p><p>Users were not notified that their contact lists were being harvested at the time.

Nearly 2.4 billion people use Facebookeach month, with 1.56 billion people visiting the site at least once every day.</p><p>The investigation comes on the heels of a difficult year for the social networking giant, which has been rocked by a series of scandals regarding how it handles user data and privacy.

Bannon to the magazine's prestigious fall festival. \"I have every intention of asking him difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative conversation,\" Remnick told the New York Times. \"The audience itself, by its presence, puts a certain pressure on a conversation that an interview alone doesn't do,\" he added. \"You can't jump on and off the record.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The message: Yes, liberal readers, we're inviting a loathsome former White House aide to the New Yorker Festival, but only to beat him up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not good enough for many New Yorker faithful, including at least one staff member.

He hasn't written anything important. He's not a teacher or a scholar. He's not an intellectual of the caliber that would justify inviting him to headline a prestigious ideas festival.</p><p>- Lindsay Beyerstein (@Beyerstein) September 3, 2018</p><p>There are many accurate characterizations of Bannon in the protest tweets. As Joshua Green wrote in his book \"Devil's Bargain,\" Bannon was raised in Richmond and is a career opportunist with stops in the Navy, on Wall Street, in Hollywood, in publishing and in national politics. In his capacity as executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon turned the website into a clickbaity Trump cheerleading team with a solid following from the far-right, including white nationalists. In August 2016, Bannon bolted from Breitbart and joined the Trump campaign, where he took the let-Trump-be-Trump doctrine to extremes. He also held faith throughout the \"Access Hollywood\" episode that Trump's voters would stick with him. He was dead-on.</p><p>In transitioning from campaigning to governing, Bannon faltered. He advocated for Trump's dreadful travel ban and other populist measures that Trump promised at his roaring rallies, but he didn't last. After a half-year or so of infighting, Bannon bolted with a pledge to help Trump from the outside, as he re-assumed his old post at Breitbart. He failed at that as well: His strong advocacy of Roy Moore's candidacy for a vacant Alabama Senate seat helped to produce a rare Democratic victory in that state, as Democrat Doug Jones prevailed in the polls.</p><p>And then Michael Wolff published Bannon's critical words about Trump and his family in \"Fire and Fury,\" at which point he lost his perch at Breitbart.</p><p>Such a streak of embarrassments didn't diminish Bannon's appeal as an interviewee. Weeks after his exit from the White House, Charlie Rose - then with \"60 Minutes,\" now with himself\u00a0- gave him ample air time to look back on the rise of Trump, not to mention to rail against the Republican establishment: \"They do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic, nationalist agenda to be implemented. It's very obvious.\"</p><p>Even back then, the interview felt weak. What did this washed-up blowhard have to offer, anyway? Hadn't we heard enough of his rat-a-tat-tat political pronouncements about the media elite, the forgotten and the promise of Trumpian politics? Apparently not: Bannon gets quoted here and there on the issues of the day. Just last week, for instance, CNN asked for Bannon's thoughts on Trump's impromptu war on big tech. He said stuff like, \"These are run by sociopaths. These people are complete narcissists. These people ought to be controlled, they ought to be regulated,\" said the former White House adviser.</p><p>Anger toward the New Yorker fits with a more protracted pattern of disgust. There are many folks who feel that the media should boycott the White House press briefings on the rationale that the president's reps lie too frequently. Some people want to see the cable networks disinvite Kellyanne Conway, who obfuscates and dissembles with an expertise that surely impresses her boss. And how about banning Trump from Twitter?</p><p>Why on earth give these people - and Bannon, and Sean\u00a0Spicer, and Sebastian Gorka - a platform, goes the objection. For that matter, why did NBC News's Megyn Kelly give Alex Jones of Infowars a platform? The answer is that journalists interview people on all sides of a topic, even when some of them are liars and worse.</p><p>Challenging them - rather than ignoring them - is what a guy like Remnick does. Watch the interview before deciding to end your New Yorker subscription.</p><p>UPDATE: In a prolonged statement, Remnick argues:</p><p>In 2016, Steve Bannon played a critical role in electing the current President of the United States. On Election Night I wrote a piece for our website that this event represented \"a tragedy for the American republic, a tragedy for the Constitution, and a triumph for the forces, at home and abroad, of nativism, authoritarianism, misogyny, and racism.\" Unfortunately, this was, if anything, an understatement of what was to come. Today, The New Yorker announced that, as part of our annual Festival, I would conduct an interview with Bannon. The reaction on social media was critical and a lot of the dismay and anger was directed at me and my decision to engage him. Some members of the staff, too, reached out to say that they objected to the invitation, particularly the forum of the festival.          </p><p>The effort to interview Bannon at length began many months ago. I originally reached out to him to do a lengthy interview with \"The New Yorker Radio Hour.\" He knew that our politics could not be more at odds-he reads The New Yorker-but he said he would do it when he had a chance. It was only later that the idea arose of doing that interview in front of an audience.</p><p>The main argument for not engaging someone like Bannon is that we are giving him a platform and that he will use it, unfiltered, to propel further the \"ideas\" of white nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, and illiberalism. But to interview Bannon is not to endorse him. By conducting an interview with one of Trumpism's leading creators and organizers, we are hardly pulling him out of obscurity. Ahead of the mid-term elections and with 2020 in sight, we'd be taking the opportunity to question someone who helped assemble Trumpism. Early this year, Michael Lewis interviewed Bannon, who made it plain how he viewed his work in the campaign. \"We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall,\" Bannon said. \"This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\" To hear this was valuable, as it revealed something about the nature of the speaker and the campaign he helped to lead. The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.          </p><p>There's no illusion here. It's obvious that no matter how tough the questioning, Bannon is not going to burst into tears and change his view of the world. He believes he is right and that his ideological opponents are mere \"snowflakes.\" The question is whether an interview has value in terms of fact, argument, or even exposure, whether it has value to a reader or an audience. Which is why Dick Cavett, in his time, chose to interview Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Or it's why Oriana Fallaci, in \"Interview with History,\" a series of question-and-answer meetings with Henry Kissinger and Ayatollah Khomeini and others, contributed something to our understanding of those figures. Fallaci hardly changed the minds of her subjects, but she did add something to our understanding of who they were. This isn't a First Amendment question; it's a question of putting pressure on a set of arguments and prejudices that have influenced our politics and a President still in office.</p><p>Some on social media have said that there is no point in talking to Bannon because he is no longer in the White House. But Bannon has already exerted enormous impact on Trump; his rhetoric, ideas, and tactics are evident in much of what this President does and says and intends. We heard Bannon in the inaugural address, which announced this Presidency's divisiveness, in the Muslim ban, and in Trump's reaction to Charlottesville. What's more, Bannon has not retired. His attempt to get Roy Moore elected in Alabama failed but he has gone on to help further the trend of illiberal, nationalist movements around the country and abroad.</p><p>There are many ways for a publication like ours to do its job: investigative reporting; pointed, well-argued opinion pieces; Profiles; reporting from all over the country and around the world; radio and video interviews; even live interviews. At the same time, many of our readers, including some colleagues, have said that the Festival is different, a different kind of forum. It's also true that we pay an honorarium, that we pay for travel and lodging. (Which does not happen, of course, when we interview someone for an article or for the radio.) I don't want well-meaning readers and staff members to think that I've ignored their concerns. I've thought this through and talked to colleagues-and I've re-considered. I've changed my mind. There is a better way to do this. Our writers have interviewed Steve Bannon for The New Yorker before, and if the opportunity presents itself I'll interview him in a more traditionally journalistic setting as we first discussed, and not on stage.</p><p>-David Remnick</p><p>          Read more:       </p><p>          Erik Wemple: A bored Trump beefs with Bloomberg News\u00a0       </p><p>          Erik Wemple: Village Voice dies again       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-e5d1935efb50431e810a67d0687730db</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-M9G1-JB4M-V2S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1855\"/><timeReceived>9:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/>Erik Wemple</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 3, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CNUK</classCode><className>US LABOR DAY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLVG</classCode><className>WHITE NATIONALISTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000DL92</classCode><className>STEVE BANNON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

We wish you and your families a happy, healthy Easter together. We'll see you back here on Monday night. Good night, everybody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Information is our chief weapon against the coronavirus, so every night we open our show by trying to give you more of it. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher joins us now with a look at the very latest numbers. Hey, Trace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker, if you look at the New York coronavirus numbers, it appears to be kind of a mixed bag.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's begin with the all-important daily percentage of increase in new cases. You can see that from April 6th to 7th, on Monday, New York's seven percent increase in the number of infections, then from the seventh to the eighth, the increase was only 6.5 percent. But the next day, it jumped up to 7.6 and today it's gone back down to 7.1 percent.</p><p>But a key barometer when it comes to flattening the curve is the number of people admitted to hospitals and ICUs, and for New York, there is very encouraging news. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Change in ICU admissions is actually a negative number for the first time since we started this intense journey.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Meantime, on the national level, we're seeing a much steadier drop in the percentage of new cases. You can see on Monday, we had a nine percent increase and then each day the increase gets lower, today, it's at 7.8 percent.</p><p>Dr. Deborah Birx says we are today where Italy was one week ago, but I also want to point out that there are some potential new hotspots including Delaware, South Dakota, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. And it's interesting that Washington State and California are being touted as examples for how to flatten the curve.</p><p>And yet, Los Angeles County just extended it stay at home mandate until May 15th, saying things will get much worse, but they failed to offer evidence or perspective to back up those claims -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace, thanks so much for that.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just heard the latest on where the virus is now. It is worth taking a moment to think about where it began -- Wuhan in Central China was the first place in the world to suffer an outbreak of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>It's worth saying that out loud from time to time, both because it is true and materially significant, but also because a lot of the people in charge would rather you forgot it.</p><p>Because Wuhan is the site of the longest running coronavirus outbreak, we ought to study what happened there carefully. It's worth knowing as much as we can about how and why the disease started and how it moved so quickly to the rest of the world.</p><p>Even now, we know surprisingly little of that for certain, though, day by day, we're learning more.</p><p>For example, how easily does the coronavirus spread through populations? Well, early data from Wuhan led researchers to conclude that every infected person on average infected about two and a half additional people.</p><p>In epidemiological terms, that is a lot of people. It means the outbreak could double every six days and that is the assumption we've been working under ever since.</p><p>Now, it looks like that assumption may have been a profound understatement of what's really happening.</p><p>A new draft paper by a team of scholars in Los Alamos National Laboratory, concludes that the Wuhan coronavirus is actually highly, highly infectious.</p><p>Based on extensive case analysis, the researchers estimate that the average infected Wuhan resident infected 5.7 other people. That's enough to double the epidemic in fewer than three days.</p><p>Is that estimate accurate? We don't know if it is. An awful lot of the conclusions about this virus have turned out to be embarrassingly wrong. That's happened again and again, as we've told you, often with enormous consequences.</p><p>But for a moment, imagine this new number from Los Alamos is correct and the size of the outbreak in Wuhan was doubling every three days. Among other things, that would mean that a huge number of people there were infected with the coronavirus.</p><p>Here's the mystery. The Chinese government allowed five million residents to flee the City of Wuhan before they locked it down in January. Most of these people presumably went on to other places within China, and yet, according to Chinese government, and by the way, as well as all available evidence we now have in the West, there were no other major outbreaks in China -- not in Shanghai, not in Chengdu, not in Beijing.</p><p>Meanwhile, other cities all over Europe and the United States have been brought to their knees by the virus. How could this be? It doesn't seem to make any sense at all.</p><p>For some reason, almost nobody in the American media has even asked about it. That's strange.</p><p>At this point, we have no real explanation for why the coronavirus spread throughout the West, but not throughout China. We should find that out.</p><p>And that's far from the only thing that we don't understand about this pandemic. How about the most basic question of all -- how deadly is it? We still don't know that either.</p><p>In Italy, more than 10 percent of people with confirmed cases of it have died. In Germany, just two percent have died. It seems to me that both of these numbers probably overstate the reality of the death rate given that most people are not tested until they're already sick. It's a very skewed sample.</p><p>More comprehensive testing in one town in Germany suggests a death rate of just 0.37 percent. Would that number hold in every place? Or could it be that town was infected with maybe a milder form of the virus? Or is it possible that some groups of people are more vulnerable to illness than others?</p><p>We know that genetics does play a major role in the way many diseases progress. Is that true with this virus? We don't know that.</p><p>While we're at it, here are a few other questions that we should answer as soon as we can. Here's one. Is the virus seasonal? Will it recede in the summer as well hoping before maybe returning in the fall and winter?</p><p>If infected people get immunity, how long does that immunity last? Will the virus mutate so that people who get it this year could once again get it now next year?</p><p>And critically something we should be thinking about, what are the long term effects of being infected with the Wuhan coronavirus?</p><p>There's mounting evidence that an awful lot of people may have it and not know they do. They have no symptoms. But do they face long term health consequences from being infected? And if so, what are those consequences? We can only guess.</p><p>Those are just some of the things that we still don't know about this strange new virus from Wuhan, China. It would have been nice if the authorities had learned a lot more about it before they took such dramatic steps in response to it.</p><p>Our leaders had two examples to choose from as this pandemic bore down on our country. They could have chosen the Swedish model of targeted restrictions coupled with voluntary distancing. Or they could have chosen the Chinese model -- total lockdowns, internal travel restrictions, punishment for those who step out of line.</p><p>Our leaders chose the Chinese model. With every passing day, the response becomes more restrictive. Requests that people stay indoors have become orders that people stay indoors. People are being fined and arrested for driving alone, for playing catch in the park, for paddle boarding on the ocean.</p><p>How are measures like that keeping us safe? The short answer is we have no idea that they are keeping us safe. In fact, as noted, we still don't know much of anything, but we're definitely not encouraged to ask too many questions about it.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has become the face of the response to coronavirus is now suggesting that America could adopt a feature of life familiar to the population of Mainland China; another one, internal passports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Can you imagine a time where Americans carry certificates of immunity?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You know, that's possible. I mean, it's one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not.</p><p>This is something that's being discussed. I think it might actually be -- have some merit under certain circumstances.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It might have some merit. Your papers, please? Imagine a country where illegal immigrant can work, drive, get welfare and vote all without a single authentic document. Meanwhile, more than 300 million legal citizens must produce government papers to prove their right to go outside. That could be where we're heading and with remarkable speed.</p><p>For what has to be the first time in the history of this country, Easter services have been banded many places. Authorities will allow citizens to go to the supermarket, but not to practice Christianity in public. The Chinese population would recognize that, too.</p><p>In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has ordered the few stores that are still open to fence off areas that offer furniture, paint, home improvement goods. Governor Whitmer considers these \"nonessential items\" so she is prohibiting their sale.</p><p>The governor of Vermont has issued similar orders for stores there; other places will doubtless follow. What would the rationale be for this? Wouldn't closing off more sections of a store increase crowding in the areas that remain open? Where exactly is the science that shows this works?</p><p>Well, of course, there isn't any. They feel like doing it, so they're doing it. Politicians understand in the end that the only risk for them is in restraint. Authoritarian overreach is almost never punished.</p><p>When the Coronavirus has finally passed from this country, our leaders want to be able to say they took it seriously. But there's nothing serious about reactions like this. These are mindless and destructive measures.</p><p>Instead of arresting people for going to church, maybe they could pause for a minute, dive into the science and answer a few of the most basic questions first.</p><p>Bret Baier is Fox's chief political anchor. He hosts \"Special Report\" every night at six, and we're always happy to have him. Bret, thanks for coming on.</p><p>So we haven't seen a ton of political debate. You cover politics, obviously -- political debate in public, anyway, over the nature of the restrictions that we're living under. Do you expect some kind of public conversation about this to emerge soon?</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: I think so, Tucker. I mean, you saw the President today in this Taskforce briefing say that this decision that he has coming up is going to be the toughest decision of his life as he decides when and if the country is coming -- is going to open up in certain sections, how it's done specifically.</p><p>And he has this second Taskforce Reopening Council, he is calling it that he is going to launch on Tuesday. That is the crux of this issue. The economy versus the health of our country, and where is the balancing act? Because on the economy side, as we've talked about, we are really taking it on the chin.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder if -- and this is a broad question, I'm just wondering your impression, I wonder if political leaders are more afraid of seeming to overreact or more afraid of seeming to under react?</p><p>BAIER: Well, I think they're really concerned about the health of the American people obviously, and when you see death numbers like 777 out of New York today that's startling and more of that and the death toll affects public policy and how people think about things.</p><p>But at the same time, you have stories of small business owners who are not having the easiest time getting this money that was promised them through banks. The small business loan program is not so smooth as of yet out the door, and the balancing act here, I think they are more worried about overreacting.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting. I mean, maybe this is early for this question. But do we have polling on whether Congress's response, this $2.2 trillion package is popular with the government? Do citizens feel like they're being helped by this or will be, doing know?</p><p>BAIER: They're going to get that check in a couple of days, the $1,200.00 check. But again, it's been a long time since you get that money, but it's going to help a little bit.</p><p>But I really think that the big issue is the money to businesses and getting it out the door.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BAIER: They're not able to open and if they can't, eventually you have to fish or cut bait, they have to let these employees go, and then you have a whole another issue.</p><p>Tucker, it's going to be -- it's not going to be a flick of a switch where the country suddenly goes on and the economy kicks off. People are going to have to feel comfortable that they can go out and do things, and that's going to take leadership and a determination by Federal and state and local authorities.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's it. I mean, you just put your finger on it right there -- Federal, state and local -- so the President -- and it was my first thought when I heard him say it. This is the biggest decision I have to make, I'll make it soon. You'll hear it soon.</p><p>But a lot of these decisions are taking place the state level, aren't they? It is governors that are shutting things down. Will that change?</p><p>BAIER: Well, it's going to have to and this Council on Tuesday is going to include some governors -- Democrats and Republicans. It's going to include some local officials, whether those are mayors, we don't have a complete list yet and business people as well as health experts and that decision and how it goes will determine, I think whether President Trump is reelected or not.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's likely to be absolutely true. I hope you'll come back then. Bret Baier, great to see you tonight. Thanks a lot.</p><p>BAIER: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a new poll confirms what -- if you've got Google you already knew -- Joe Biden was a placeholder candidate, a person people have affection for, they tolerate, but don't necessarily think should be their standard bearer in an election.</p><p>According to \"The New York Post,\" a new national poll of Democrats finds that 56 percent of Democratic voters would like Biden replaced on the ticket by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The Governor's unofficial presidential campaign is getting a ton of free advertising from CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Now, you know, I've seen you referred to a little bit recently as the Luv Guv and I'm wondering if that's bleeding into your demeanor at all, making you a little soft on the President?</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I've always been a soft guy. I am the Luv Guv. I'm a cool dude and loose mood. You know that. I just say let it go. Just go with the flow, baby, you know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: This is called the process of humanizing a candidate. Everyone takes Andrew Cuomo seriously. He is a pretty serious guys. He is doing media briefings on TV every day. But the question is, could I like a guy like that?</p><p>And that's when it really helps to have a brother who works in television. The Luv Guv had him smoothly tee up his presidential aspirations right on CNN. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>C. CUOMO: Are you now giving a different consideration on running for President?</p><p>A. CUOMO: No.</p><p>C. CUOMO: So, you are still not thinking --</p><p>A. CUOMO: But it's a good question. But why?</p><p>C. CUOMO: Well, it's definitely a good question.</p><p>A. CUOMO: Well, I'm a thinking -- I'm a thinking being. I am thinking about a lot of things.</p><p>C. CUOMO: Yes. I bet.</p><p>A. CUOMO: I'm not that politician who says yes, I want it. It's all about me and then the step on the ladder.</p><p>Luv Guv says no way. I gave my word and my word is good. I'm not your typical guy.</p><p>Don't laugh. You're going to pay. Chris, one day you're going to be better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I am not one of those governors who thinks about I don't know, being President or anything.</p><p>The question is -- and this is a serious legal question, actually -- is CNN reporting into these segments is in-kind contributions to the F.E.C.? That's a political campaign ad you just saw. Are they admitting it?</p><p>Buck Sexton hosts \"The Buck Sexton Show.\" We're happy to have him on with us tonight. Buck, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, HOST, THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So I just want to be clear, we've kind of laid off the CNN host over there. He has the coronavirus. He is broadcasting from his house. I admire that. I wish him well. I feel sorry for him being trapped down there.</p><p>So leaving that aside, and I mean it, having a presidential candidate on your show and humanizing him in the way that they're doing in a really kind of transparent, political way, why is that different from a campaign ad?</p><p>SEXTON: Well, it's not. I think you could make the case that CNN is effectively an ongoing contribution to the D.N.C. Now, I think that the pretense that CNN clings to, just as an organization that for example, their primetime lineup and anybody can try this -- and some of them by the way or some of the hosts are very aggressive on Twitter. So you could actually, you at home, you could probably ask, and you might even get an answer from some of the more thin skinned ones.</p><p>You could say, are you a journalist or are you an opinion host? CNN is really alone of the networks in having people that are clearly opinion, but act as though they're journalists and think that then that gives them a pass for things like exactly what you're talking about, which is being effectively a propaganda arm of the D.N.C. or of a specific Democratic candidate.</p><p>And I actually worked at CNN during the 2016 election, believe it or not, and what was being said off and on air in favor of Hillary Clinton and against Bernie Sanders was jaw dropping, and then of course, we found out that there was at least one case of someone giving questions.</p><p>So there was a lot of bad behavior in that regard. But we don't think that CNN is ever going to be held responsible for this. They're clearly doing everything they can to stop Trump from getting reelected. If that means somebody stands in for Biden, Tucker, I think they're willing to help that effort, too.</p><p>CARLSON: You make a really smart point. I mean, we just had Bret Bair who is our chief political correspondent on, I couldn't ring up an opinion out, although I tried. He just won't give his opinion. Period. Because he is a news guy. Period.</p><p>There's not one person on CNN like that. Not one. Is there?</p><p>SEXTON: No, not on the primetime line up. What's amazing is they cling to the old model of thinking that they're just being objective -- they are so right in their opinions that that's objectivity, which is both delusional and a little scary.</p><p>But I would say this, there's also a broader issue here, and I don't want to get into -- you know, people are now trying to rewrite the history of who said what about the pandemic, and oh, you know, conservative media was wrong and look, that's a completely --</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I got it, yes.</p><p>SEXTON: That's ridiculous. It's a farce. But even beyond that, the lack of trust that we have now in objective news media that claims to be objective, at least, that has been a big problem, because., of course, there's a sense that these people are pushing an agenda at places like CNN.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>SEXTON: Of course, there's an understanding that there's -- I mean, and so, it's absurd to think otherwise. So then when we get lectured and talked down to for saying, well, hold on a second, when, for example, Nancy Pelosi holds up funding for American small businesses and they change the headlines to reflect that it's a stalemate. We all know what that's about.</p><p>CARLSON: Because they're completely in the tank. Buck Sexton, great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>SEXTON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Big Tech is already spying on almost everything you do. If you've got a phone with you, they know where you are, but the coronavirus crisis will allow them to do it even more under the guise of public health. We'll tell you how after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Apple and Google make billions of dollars by harvesting your personal data information about you -- private information. So it's not surprising how they like to fight the coronavirus by teaming up to make a tracking app that will monitor you through your phone.</p><p>What could go wrong? Fox's Matt Finn is here live with more on that. Hey, Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, these two tech rivals are actually collaborating to develop software that will alert you if you cross paths with someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>In a statement today, Apple says that this software will use existing Bluetooth technology already in our smartphones. The tracing apps will notify you if you come within a certain distance of another phone belonging to a person that tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>The software is able to look back for 14 days to tell you where you might have come in contact with someone with COVID-19.</p><p>Of course, there are a lot of questions. This technology only works if people who tested positive for the coronavirus are willing to share that personal medical information entered into a phone. Apple says some of the technology will be available next month.</p><p>Today, President Trump says the tech raises privacy concerns, but he will take a look at it. Apple made the coding for this software already public so that it can be analyzed and says if a person deletes the app, their private information is also erased.</p><p>The ACLU says tracing apps could be effective in curbing the coronavirus until there is widespread and free testing. The ACLU writes in a statement, \"People only trust these systems if they protect privacy, remain voluntary and store data on an individual's device not a centralized repository.\"</p><p>The ACLU says it will remain vigilant to make sure tracing apps like these remain voluntary -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Matt Finn, great to see you tonight. Thank you. And by voluntary that means that you agree to it, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have any idea that you agreed to it. You checked the box some time ago and that's voluntary. It's cool with the ACLU. They're looking out for you.</p><p>By the way, we should say, that's totally fine, and if you have any problem with it at all, you're some kind of paranoid disloyal American, okay. Big Tech wants to track you through your phone. Health officials want immunity passports. And as we'll discuss later, they're closing down Easter.</p><p>Some wants bans like this and measures like this to last indefinitely, at least a year or more. What kind of country are we creating? And can we maintain any semblance of the America we knew, say last month, during the course of it?</p><p>Ned Ryan is founder and CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight. Ned, thanks so much for coming on. So we really could kind of choose the Chinese model here. We're closing down churches, restrictions on internal movement, using technology to track our own citizens. Could there may have been another model other than the Chinese model to respond to this pandemic -- this Chinese pandemic?</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Yes, no, I think Sweden and some of these other countries probably had the right approach where they've taken a responsible approach and said certain people have to be quarantined, but we're not going to shut down the entire country.</p><p>I think the thing that's terrifying about all of this, Tucker is, again, we're building this Orwellian surveillance state in which we're combining big government and Big Tech. What was it -- Reagan said, some of the most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.</p><p>I think an even more terrifying version of that is I'm from the government and Big Tech, and I'm here to help, and if you hear those words, dear God, run like the devil is one step behind you. I do not trust them.</p><p>And Tucker, when you hear about a national surveillance -- a coronavirus surveillance system being proposed by someone in the White House. You hear about immunity cards. I mean, this is very troubling stuff.</p><p>And I have to tell you, I think Trump should bench Fauci for what he said about the immunity cards, and also the stupidity of it. How are you actually going to have enough people with immunity cards if you're calling for quarantining and people sheltering in place? It makes absolutely no sense.</p><p>And at some point, we as the American people have to decide, are we going to wholesale surrender our liberties in hopes for a little security against a virus that I do not think will have the mortality rates of the Asian or Hong Kong flu? And if we do surrender our rights, we don't deserve to be a free people.</p><p>CARLSON: At some point, I hope the public will be consulted on this. I mean, it seems like power has moved into the hands of a lot of unelected people. In some cases, impressive people like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who I think is a very impressive person and a nice person, by the way, we've interviewed him, but he is not elected by anybody.</p><p>And we've got to kind of wonder about a system in which people who haven't been elected, about whom we know nothing, for the most part are making the consequential decisions, is that a democracy?</p><p>RYUN: No, it's not, and I think this is where some of these red state governors have to take the bull by the horns and say, by the first of May, we are going to in a very responsible way have a red state revolt in which we open up a lot of our states, open up restaurants, open up businesses, in a responsible way.</p><p>Masks required -- all of these things. But we have to, in the second half of April, I really think flatten the media hysteria curve, stop listening to models that are filled with garbage assumptions and garbage data, and let's get some real stats and have a real conversation, and let's get back.</p><p>Because my concern, Tucker, in all of this, if we continue down this path, we might end up with more suicides and bankruptcies than actual coronavirus deaths as we are destroying our economy.</p><p>We have 17 million Americans who are already unemployed in the first three weeks of this. If we continue down this path, this year will be far more deadly than to the disease.</p><p>CARLSON: At the very least, we should demand actual evidence to justify these decisions.</p><p>RYUN: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: In fact, next week, we're going to be interviewing a series of governors and political leaders and just ask them respectfully, but where's the science to justify what you're doing? Maybe they will have a good answer. Maybe they won't. We'll find out. Ned, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>RYUN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So let's say you were running a country and your job was to protect your nation from coronavirus. What would you do? Your best strategy might be listen to the head of the World Health Organization, and then do the opposite of what he recommends.</p><p>His greatest hits, next.</p><p>But first, a look at what coronavirus has done to the world's greatest cities.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the current pandemic has focused on an awful lot of attention, it's something you may have heard of, but not know much about, the World Health Organization. That's an international organization that the U.S. has quietly automatically, unthinkingly spent billions of dollars supporting over the decades and mostly, we felt good about it.</p><p>But now it's time to ask the very reasonable question the President is in fact asking -- what are we getting for that support?</p><p>China spends less than half as much as we do supporting the W.H.O., and it's clear what they get. They get a servile global organization that is abetting their rise to superpower status. It's a pretty good deal for them.</p><p>The W.H.O. excludes Taiwan from membership solely because Beijing has demanded that they do that, cruelly, by the way.</p><p>From the start of this pandemic, the World Health Organization has done shockingly little to stop the virus from spreading around the world. In fact, when the organization appears in public at all, it seems to be functioning purely as an offshoot of Chinese state media.</p><p>Tedros Adhanom who is the Director of the World Health Organization has been there for close to three years. He was elected with the support of China over the opposition of the United States.</p><p>In late January, Tedros was gushing that China had contained coronavirus. In fact, he said China had set a standard that the rest of the world ought to copy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. TEDROS ADHANOM, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak.</p><p>China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it's not an exaggeration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: All hail China. Tedros was so impressed with the Chinese government, so confident that coronavirus was defeated that he attacked other nations for daring to take the racist step of protecting themselves.</p><p>When the President announced travel restrictions on China in late January, Tedros said that would \"have the effect of increasing fear and stigma with little public health benefit.\"</p><p>On February 3rd, he gushed about the Chinese dictator Xi and attacked any notion of slowing down global travel or trade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADHANOM: I was so impressed in my meeting with President Xi and his detailed knowledge of the outbreak.</p><p>There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's just absolutely disgusting and stupid and violate science and commonsense. Tedros was completely wrong. And because he was wrong, coronavirus became a global calamity.</p><p>Three weeks ago as one country after another entered lockdown, Tedros told the world, you should imitate Wuhan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADHANOM: Wuhan reported no new cases for the first time since the outbreak started. Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world that even the most severe situation can be turned around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's one of the most corrupt displays I think anyone has ever seen on tape. Of course, if other countries wanted to reduce their caseload, they don't want to take the World Health Organization's advice, and just like the C.D.C. in this country, W.H.O. was pushing the absurd claim that facemask somehow don't work and are not useful for containing the coronavirus.</p><p>China, meanwhile, the country that Tedros never stops praising did not agree with that. In fact, they were hoarding masks. They were doing it all the way back in January.</p><p>In fact, you start to wonder how honest the World Health Organization was even giving that advice. You also wonder how honest Dr. Tedros was when he warned against accelerating the use of hydroxychloroquine to fight the virus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADHANOM: Using untested medicines without the right evidence could raise false hope and even do more harm than good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: At this point, it is pretty obvious. This guy is trying to hurt people. He runs the World Health Organization and he is intentionally trying to hurt us.</p><p>If you wanted an effective anti-coronavirus strategy, you would just do everything that Tedros tells you not to.</p><p>In fact, that's been a pretty solid position to take for a long time. Before he ran the World Health Organization, Tedros was the Health Minister of Ethiopia. On three separate occasions -- three -- that country was ravaged by cholera epidemics. Tedros lied about it. He refused to admit it was happening and insisted instead, it was just an outbreak of \"acute watery diarrhea.\"</p><p>Hundreds died in those outbreaks which are only accurately identified when they spread into neighboring countries. In other words, he lied on behalf of the Ethiopian government, which was worried more about tourism and their reputation than people surviving an epidemic.</p><p>Then he took over the World Health Organization and Tedros vowed to crack down on corruption at that organization. That hasn't happened either.</p><p>The W.H.O. still spends $200 million a year flying its staff around the world often in business. That's something other health organizations banned their staff from doing. Doctors Without Borders would never do something like that.</p><p>Corruption, dishonesty, cover up, shilling for authoritarian dictatorships, lying as people die -- no wonder Tedros and China are such profound allies.</p><p>Fortunately, people are wising up to this, even the governor of New York Andrew Cuomo says the World Health Organization should be open to criticism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>A. CUOMO: Where were the warning signs? Who was supposed to blow the whistle? The President was asked this question and I think he's right.</p><p>The President's answer is the World Health Organization should have been blowing the whistle. I don't -- I don't know enough to know if that's right or wrong, but I know the question is right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, the question is certainly right, and the answer is very obvious. They didn't blow the whistle. People died as a result, and they still get to run around calling themselves the World Health Organization.</p><p>Why should we support corrupt international organizations like this? That's not a partisan political issue. Funding the W.H.O. has only given us a hostile, dishonest bureaucracy that's directly responsible for spreading this pandemic. We should get out of that organization immediately, and only fund health organizations that help people and prevent disease. And by the way, there are a lot of them -- just not this one.</p><p>Well, Christians who want to celebrate Easter -- that's a lot of people -- many millions may have to do it privately in their homes. No, this is still America apparently. But it's happening.</p><p>We'll talk to a pastor has been harassed by police for the crime of holding drive-in services, next.</p><p>But first another look at how the coronavirus has affected cities around the world.</p><p>CARLSON: The coronavirus pandemic has certainly focused the mind of the country and revealed which issues actually matter and which were just frivolous.</p><p>As horrible as this is, you are hearing a lot less all of a sudden about which pronouns you're allowed to use and how borders are racist, at least for most people -- not this guy. This is a Princeton Professor apparently actually a Professor at Princeton called Eddie Glaude, Jr. today on MSNBC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, JR., PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: We're dying, and we're seeing the disproportionate impact of the burden of this pandemic, precisely because of the inequality and the deep structural racism that has defined American society for generations.</p><p>I'm talking about black America, and I think the effects of this pandemic will throw us back into the 60s and the 50s in terms of our economic standing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Watching that really does make you hope that Princeton goes out of business soon. It's just garbage. It doesn't help anybody. Those words sound like something from another century -- structural racism? Coronavirus is going to bring back Jim Crow?</p><p>It's idiotic, it's mindless. It's also dangerous. The truth is coronavirus is hurting everyone in this country. It unites us that way. It's killing people of all races. It doesn't care what color you are.</p><p>Only people like that care what color you are because by dividing us, they become more powerful. Let's hope that end soon.</p><p>Well, this weekend is Easter, but for the first time in America's history, the country's Christians will not be able to celebrate it with one another even if they want to.</p><p>Most governments of this country will not allow them to gather in churches. Mississippi is under lockdown, all nonessential businesses are closed. That means liquor stores, of course are still open. They are essential. Churches are not essential according to the state.</p><p>King James Bible Baptist Church has been trying to hold drive-in services that means parishioners remain in their cars during it, but cops showed up anyway and raided it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLES E. HAMILTON, PASTOR, KING JAMES BIBLE BAPTIST CHURCH: This is King James Bible Baptist Church of Pastor Hamilton, where, I'm the Pastor of the church.</p><p>I'm a good citizen. I ain't breaking no law, ain't selling to drugs. I'm just preaching the Word of God. And look at all of the police car here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was Pastor James Hamilton you heard on the tape. We're happy to have him on with us tonight, along with Kelly Shackelford, President of the First Liberty Institute. Thanks so much for coming on, both of you. First to you, Pastor, what exactly were you doing wrong?</p><p>HAMILTON: Well, we weren't doing anything wrong. We were abiding by the C.D.C. guidelines that the City of Greenville had put in place, also the State of Mississippi.</p><p>Our members of the church was inside of their cars, had their windows up, and I was preaching the Word of God, so no one was outside. And also we had cars at a distance. And so legally, we weren't doing anything wrong. We were going by the C.D.C. guidelines.</p><p>And so I don't understand why the police officers would come to our church and try to break it up.</p><p>CARLSON: It's totally outrageous. Kelly Shackelford, I assume that when this happened, every Civil Rights group in America jumped to the pastor's defense, right?</p><p>KELLY SHACKELFORD, PRESIDENT, FIRST LIBERTY INSTITUTE: I don't know about that. We certainly did. The order that's in Greenville is just massively unconstitutional.</p><p>It targets churches in a way that it targets no other groups. So, cars in parking lots are fine. It's only a crime if the cars in the parking lot are at the church parking lot.</p><p>And I mean, look at last night, he had probably six, seven or so cars there for the church, and yet they were surrounded by police. And I don't know if you saw the video, Tucker, but one of the police officers came up to Pastor Hamilton and said that because of these orders, because that local order in Greenville, Mississippi, that his rights were suspended.</p><p>Those are the specific words he used, like your constitutional rights are gone now. I don't know what country he thinks he's living in, but your rights aren't suspended, and I would just tell any church that has any of these issues or whatever. We have a lot of this information, go to firstliberty.org -- just spell out First Liberty. It'll tell you that you do have rights that we want to follow the C.D.C. guidelines. We don't want people to be injured in any way and that's what this church did.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>SHACKELFORD: That doesn't give people the right to discriminate against churches and treat them in this kind of way.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course it doesn't. So Pastor, I mean, I -- I'm not against liquor stores, but liquor stores don't answer the question what happens when you die? Which is something maybe it'd be nice to know now that people are dying from this pandemic. How do you feel that liquor stores get to continue, but you can't celebrate Easter in church?</p><p>HAMILTON: I think of it like this. I believe that liquor -- beer have killed more people than the coronavirus ever would. And so it's a sad case in America.</p><p>Whoever thought that we will have a government in Greenville that will pass such a law that will allow the liquor stores to have curb side service, but when it comes to the church and try to disrupt a church service -- I would have never dreamed in a thousand years that America, the home of the braves and the land of the free would ever pass this law that will consider a liquor store essential, but church nonessential. I am shocked.</p><p>CARLSON: So 87,000 Americans died of alcohol last year. This epidemic is projected to kill 60,000. So you're absolutely right, technically, factually, you're right.</p><p>I just want to go out on this. I would like to know and if you know the name, I hope you'll say it on the air, who made this decision that liquor stores get a pass, but hassle your church with armed police officers? What politician decided that was a good idea, Pastor?</p><p>HAMILTON: Mayor Errick Simmons. He is the mayor. He's a supporter of Joe Biden. He made a decision that because most of the vile that was coming with linked he said to the churches, so that's why he came down very hard on the churches, to not have drive-in service.</p><p>I can tell you when 20 police cars came to our church, we felt -- not just me -- we felt intimidated. We felt frightened, and I heard about this in China. I heard this about a communist country, but I would never thought that I would feel so afraid and my people would feel so frightened and intimidated by police officers.</p><p>CARLSON: So you hear about Civil Rights violations. This is an actual Civil Rights violation. Pastor, thanks so much for coming on. Kelly Shackelford, I appreciate your coming, too. Thank you.</p><p>SHACKELFORD: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So health officials have hoped that a new test for the coronavirus antibodies will let us determine exactly how far this disease has spread. Will the test be reliable? Dr. Siegel has the very latest on this. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: In tonight's installment of tweets that haven't aged well, we present you ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Eric Swalwell. On March 4th, Swalwell, tweeted this, \"Stop wearing facemasks. #Coronavirus.\"</p><p>A month later, Swalwell backtracked. He tweeted this, \"I regret listening to the Surgeon General and posting this. We all need to wear masks if we go out.\" We're happy the congressman came around, but you also have to wonder -- this is a guy who believes the administration is controlled by Russia. So why is he listening to the Surgeon General? Wouldn't he be a Putin puppet, too?</p><p>By the way, why wasn't Eric Swalwell thinking for himself? Right, because he can't.</p><p>Well, U.S. health authorities are rolling out a new coronavirus antibodies test. The plan is to use the test to estimate how widespread the infection is in this country. The man we consider our show's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Marc Siegel. He joins us with more on that, plus the effort to develop a safe, effective vaccine.</p><p>Doctor, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, I spoke to Tony Fauci this morning about both things, and he said that that testing is really proceeding rapidly. But the trick is going to be to get a unified test and 70 different companies and labs have applied to the F.D.A. for emergency approval.</p><p>He thinks that over the next few weeks, we're going to be able to get an antibody test or more than one where we can say you've been exposed, now, you're over it. You can go back to work. That's huge.</p><p>At the same time, Tony talked to me about the vaccine development and he said that the Moderna vaccine that the N.I.H. is looking at is very encouraging, and it's about to go out of Phase 1 trials and soon into Phase 2. That's where they really see how effective it is. That's what they look for the manufacturing process.</p><p>By the time it gets to market several months from now, as you know, ton of regulations but a lot of money has to be put into it, up to about a billion dollars, the manufacturing process.</p><p>All of that is ahead, but he warned that in developing a vaccine, you could actually turn the virus into a super virus where you actually see more effects from the vaccine that make you worse. That has happened. And they're looking very carefully in animal models to make sure that that does not happen here.</p><p>It's one of the reasons that it takes a while, Tucker, to actually get an effective vaccine. You've got to be careful.</p><p>You don't want to get a vaccine that you think works. Try it out on a lot of people and find out there's a big side effect like that.

If there was a view that another stimulus scheme wasn't going to be reached, equities would probably be much lower, but the modest losses reflects the back and forth between the two political sides,\" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.</p><p>On the corporate front, Pfizer ended the best Dow performer, up 3.9% after the drugmaker reported a double-digit second-quarter revenue fall but the US pharmaceutical firm raised its annual guidance regardless.</p><p>In the period to June 28, revenue fell 11% to USD11.80 billion from USD13.26 billion the same period the year before. Net income fell 32% to USD3.43 billion from USD5.05 billion. </p><p>More promisingly, Pfizer raised its annual revenue forecast slightly to between USD48.6 billion to USD50.6 billion, from the previous range of USD48.5 billion to USD50.5 billion.</p><p>Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected between USD2.85 and USD2.95. Pfizer previously forecast an annual adjusted diluted EPS between USD2.82 to USD2.92.</p><p>In the second quarter, Pfizer's adjusted diluted EPS fell to USD0.78 from USD0.80 in the year prior. </p><p>Late Monday, Pfizer and German biotech BioNTech said they began their late-stage human trial for a potential coronavirus vaccine as pharmaceutical companies, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, race to win regulatory approval before the end of the year.</p><p>At the other end of the Dow, 3M ended the worst performer, down 4.9% after the industrial conglomerate 3M Co on Tuesday posted a double-digit second-quarter revenue decline but has noticed \"improving sales trends\" since then.</p><p>In the three months ended June 30, net sales fell 12% to USD7.18 billion from USD8.17 billion a year ago. Net income however improved 14% to USD1.29 billion from USD1.13 billion.</p><p>Operating expenses fell 16% to USD6.47 billion from USD5.44 billion.</p><p>McDonald's closed down 2.5% after the fast-food chain said its second-quarter earnings tumbled due to restaurant closures and \"dramatic changes in consumer behaviour\".</p><p>Revenue in the quarter ended June 30 fell 30% to USD3.76 billion from USD5.41 billion. Net income tumbled 68% to USD483.8 million from USD1.52 billion.</p><p>For the whole of the first half, revenue dropped 19% to USD8.48 billion with net income falling 44% to USD1.59 billion. </p><p>Meanwhile, a high-stakes congressional hearing with the heads of Amazon, Apple and other tech giants, which will feature the testimony of the world's richest man Amazon's Jeff Bezos, will take place on Wednesday. </p><p>Chief executives of those companies along with Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are scheduled to appear Wednesday for a hearing that will look at whether Big Tech has attained too much dominance as they have become increasingly central to the global economy.</p><p>The testimony comes at a time of growing complaints about the dominance of 'Big Tech' and amid calls by some politicians and activists to break them up.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve is also scheduled to complete a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged and focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he characterises the state of the economy.</p><p>In Europe, FTSE 100 in London closed up 0.4%, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended flat and the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.2%.</p><p>In Asia on Tuesday, the JapaneseNikkei 225 index ended down 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong also ended up 0.7%. </p><p>Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY105.07 at the New York close Monday, down from JPY105.44 at the close Friday.</p><p>The euro was trading at EUR1.1720 at the New York close, lower from EUR1.1747 late Monday.</p><p>The pound changed hands at USD1.2945, up sharply from USD1.2875.

Germany is concerned infections from a farm in Bavaria are spreading, while China sees the most local cases in at least four months as resurgences occur in the western and northeastern regions. Earnings results from McDonald's and 3M do not paint a positive picture of the US economy and that is also weighing on the crude demand outlook,\" said OANDA analyst Edward Moya.</p><p>The US earnings calendar on Wednesday has second-quarter earnings from aerospace giant Boeing, carmaker General Motors and payments processor PayPal Holdings. </p><p>By Arvind Bhunjun;

Congressional stimulus talks have stalled since early August with both political parties about USD1 trillion apart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 525.05 points, or 1.9%, at 26,763.13. The S&amp;P 500 lost 78.65 points, or 2.4%, closing at 3,236.92. The Nasdaq Composite ended 330.65 points lower, or 3.0%, at 10,632.98.</p><p>\"US stocks initially were boosted by the standard pandemic trading playbook, which calls to expect bullish momentum from incremental positive coronavirus vaccine news and a blockbuster earnings report, this time from Nike,\" said Oanda Markets analyst Edward Moya.</p><p>\"The rally was short-lived as it was not enough to overcome growing fears that the economy is poised to see widespread shutdowns and that Congress is nowhere close to reaching an agreement for more fiscal stimulus. President Trump said the US would not be implementing a second round of lockdowns, but Wall Street remains skeptical,\" Moya added. </p><p>On the Dow, Nike was one of only two components to end in the green, up 8.8% after the sportswear maker, late Tuesday, reported blowout quarterly earnings on strong digital sales, as its chief executive cheered the return of pro US sports. The athletic apparel giant notched an 82% increase in digital sales.</p><p>The stock hit a record high of USD130.38 in early trade. </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson closed up 0.2% after the medical devices and pharmaceutical company said it launched its pivotal, multi-country phase three trial for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S, developed by subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutical Co.</p><p>The initiation of the Ensemble trial follows positive interim results from the US pharmaceutical giant's phase 1/2a clinical study, which demonstrated that the safety profile and immunogenicity after a single vaccination supported further development.</p><p>The Ensemble trial will enrol up to 60,000 volunteers across three continents, and will study the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose against placebo in preventing Covid-19. J&amp;J still anticipates the first batches of a Covid-19 vaccine to be available for emergency use authorisation in early 2021.</p><p>On the Nasdaq Composite, Tesla shares were weighing on the tech-heavy index, ending down 10%. The electric carmaker's Chief Executive Elon Musk pledged to halve the cost of car batteries, but also warned of \"the extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology\" at the Palo-Alto-based firm's 'Battery Day' on Tuesday.</p><p>In addition, tech stocks were also under pressure with Google parent Alphabet closing down 3.5% and social media platform Facebook finishing 2.3% lower on increased regulatory pressure on internet companies.</p><p>The Trump administration unveiled legislation aimed at limiting the liability shield of online services for content they host, the latest in a series of proposals motivated by a backlash against 'Big Tech' platforms.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposal seeks to reform a law known as Section 230 which protects internet services from liability from third-party content.</p><p>\"For too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\" said Attorney General William Barr. \"Ensuring that the internet is a safe, but also vibrant, open and competitive environment is vitally important to America.\"</p><p>Barr said the bill would make platforms liable if they \"unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate criminal activity online\".</p><p>Elsewhere, Cintas ended 2.5% lower after the employee services firm said the Covid-19 pandemic is still a \"significant disruption\" and decided against providing annual guidance.</p><p>In the three months to August 31, the company's first-quarter, revenue fell 3.6% to USD1.75 billion from USD1.81 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit climbed 17% year-on-year, however, to USD325.2 million from USD279.0 million. Profit was helped by a 12% cut in selling and administrative expenses to USD476.5 million.</p><p>Uniform rental and facility services are among the services Cintas offers. Revenue there fell 4.1% annually to USD1.39 billion during the quarter. </p><p>On the economic front, US business activity edged a touch lower in September, with strength in manufacturing offset by a fall in the services sector, data from IHS Markit showed.</p><p>The flash US services purchasing managers' index reading was 54.6 in September, down from 55.0 in August, just shy of market consensus cited by FXStreet of 54.7. The September print was a two-month low, according to Markit.</p><p>The flash US manufacturing PMI score was 53.5 in September, up from 53.1 in August. The figure beat the consensus estimate of 53.2. The September reading was a 20-month high. The composite PMI print was 54.4 in September, down from 54.6 in August.</p><p>In Europe, FTSE 100 in London closed up 1.2%, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended up 0.6% and the CAC 40 in Paris finished 0.4% higher. </p><p>In Asia on Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.1% as Japanese financial markets resumed trading after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed down 0.1%. </p><p>The pound was quoted at USD1.2719 in London, down from USD1.2733 at the New York close Tuesday, following disappointing UK PMI data. </p><p>The euro was changing hands at USD1.1660 at the close, down from USD1.1705 late Tuesday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was trading at JPY105.42, up from JPY105.00.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate oil was quoted at USD39.70 a barrel at the close, little changed from USD39.75 a barrel late Monday, while Brent oil was trading at USD41.62, flat from USD41.65 from Tuesday's close.</p><p>Gold was trading at two-month lows, quoted at USD1,860.12 an ounce late Wednesday, down sharply from USD1,901.22 at the New York equities close Tuesday.</p><p>\"Gold is down on the day because of the aggressive move lower in silver, and the firmer dollar is playing a part too. Silver and gold tend to move in the same direction, and it seems the negative move in silver has dragged down gold. In the past week, gold has been moving lower and a break below USD1,863 should pave the way for further losses,\" explained CMC Markets analyst David Madden. </p><p>The economic events calendar on Thursday has the latest US jobless claims figures at 0830 EDT. In addition, Powell will conclude his three days of testimony on Thursday in front of the Senate Banking Committee, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. </p><p>The US earnings calendar on Thursday has second-quarter results from Trip.com and fourth-quarter results from Costco Wholesale. </p><p>By Arvind Bhunjun;

The S&amp;P 500 shed 59.77 points, or 1.8%, closing at 3,339.19. The Nasdaq Composite ended down 221.97 points, or 2.0%, at 10,919.59.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big tech and software stocks, which have been pummelled over the past week, fell on Thursday, with shares of Apple, Microsoft and Netflix ending down 3.3%, 2.8% and 3.9% respectively. </p><p>Commenting on the sell-off in tech stocks, analysts at TD Ameritrade said: \"It seems that some investors felt prices of tech-related companies may have gotten a little out of hand and wanted to book some profits and reassess where more appropriate valuations might be. Even though many tech-related companies are benefiting as more people work, learn, and play at home, investors still want to be realistic. </p><p>\"It's arguable that the recent pullback might be healthy for the market, especially if some money rotates out of the Tech sector to help other sectors gain ground and make the recovery more broad-based.\"</p><p>Citigroup closed down 0.9%. The Wall Street giant became the first major lender to name a woman as its chief executive. The move comes as the male-dominated world of US finance faces pressure to diversify its workforce, especially in high-profile roles. </p><p>Citi promoted Jane Fraser to be its next CEO and will take over the top job in February, replacing Michael Corbat who will retire. </p><p>Fraser, who has served as president and CEO of Citi's global consumer banking arm since 2019, will join the board of directors immediately, the bank said. She has held prior roles for Citi in Latin America and in investment banking.</p><p>\"Fraser is shattering a glass ceiling that has been in place way too long. Her qualifications made this an easy decision and that is why Citi promoted her last year to president, their second-highest post. A good part of 2020 is about bridging the many inequality gaps that exist and this appointment will resonate very well for some investors,\" said Oanda market analyst Edward Moya.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the latest twist to the LVMH-Tiffany saga, the French luxury goods firm accused the US jeweller of \"dishonesty\" Thursday, saying it would do battle in court as plans for a sparkling tie-up descended into bitter recrimination.</p><p>Tiffany shares closed up 0.4% in New York, while LVHM ended up 0.1% in Paris. </p><p>\"LVMH was surprised by the lawsuit filed by Tiffany,\" the French owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moet &amp; Chandon said in a statement. \"LVMH considers that this action is totally unfounded. It has clearly been prepared by Tiffany a long time ago and communicated in a misleading way to shareholders and is defamatory. </p><p>\"The long preparation of this assignment demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH,\" it added.</p><p>The Paris-based firm vowed to \"defend itself vigorously\" against Tiffany's accusation that it had failed to seek regulatory approvals for the planned USD16.2 billion acquisition in a timely manner.</p><p>In Europe, FTSE 100 in London closed down 0.2%, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.2%.</p><p>In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended up 0.9%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.6%, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong ended down 0.6%.</p><p>On the economic front, the latest US weekly jobless claims were unchanged on the week before, according to data from the Department of Labor on Thursday.</p><p>For the week to September 5, seasonally-adjusted initial jobless claims came in at 884,000, unchanged on the week before. FXStreet consensus had pencilled in a decrease to 846,000.</p><p>Continuing claims for the week ended August 29 rose to 13.4 million from 13.3 million the week prior. This again missed consensus, which had stood at 12.9 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers remain far apart on another round of stimulus spending, with Republicans pushing for a pared-down bill and pointing to strength in the housing market and elsewhere as signs that a broader relief package isn't needed.</p><p>The pound was quoted at USD1.2785 in London, down sharply from USD1.2996 at the New York close Wednesday, trading at fresh six-week lows as investors become increasing concerns by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. </p><p>At a stormy meeting in London, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic gave the UK until the end of the month to drop the controversial provisions in the Internal Market Bill or face the potential collapse of talks on a free trade agreement.</p><p>However, cabinet office minister Michael Gove - who co-chairs a joint committee on the withdrawal agreement with Sefcovic - said the UK government was not prepared to back down.</p><p>The euro was changing hands at USD1.1816 at the close, firm from USD1.1805 late Wednesday, after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde forecast the eurozone's coronavirus downturn would be less severe than feared.</p><p>Lagarde acknowledged a recent spike in coronavirus cases was causing \"headwinds\" for the recovery whose pace remained uncertain, but added data pointed to a \"strong rebound\" in the third quarter.</p><p>According to the ECB's latest forecasts, the eurozone economy is likely to shrink by 8.0% this year, compared with an earlier projection of negative 8.7%</p><p>Lagarde told reporters the rise of the euro had been discussed - though it was absent from the policy statement - and was \"something to be monitored carefully\".</p><p>Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was trading at JPY106.10, lower than JPY106.20.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate oil was quoted at USD37.00 a barrel at the close, down from USD38.02 a barrel late Wednesday, while Brent oil was trading at USD39.80, down from USD40.68.</p><p>Gold was quoted at USD1,945.41 an ounce at the New York equities close, lower against USD1,950.72 late Wednesday.</p><p>The economic events calendar on Friday has US consumer price index figures at 0830 EDT. </p><p>By Arvind Bhunjun;

The outlook is foggy for big-tech as the latest TikTok developments continues to add further strain to US-China trade relations and as Wall Street needs to start pricing in a Blue wave in November that would trigger higher taxes and tougher regulations,\" Oanda's Edward Moya said. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US government ordered a ban on downloads of popular video app TikTok and effectively blocked the use of the Chinese super-app WeChat on US national security grounds, escalating a fight with Beijing over digital technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The measures would effectively disable the Tencent-owned WeChat app in the US from Sunday, but are expected to allow TikTok users who have already downloaded the app to keep accessing the service through November 12.</p><p>TD Ameritrade's JJ Kinahan noted Friday was a rare \"quadruple witching day\".</p><p>\"Remember, it's 'quadruple witching,' the Friday each quarter when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single-stock futures all expire. This can make things move more quickly and dramatically than usual, especially around the open and close,\" Kinahan explained. </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 244.56 points, or 0.9%, at 27,657.42 Friday. The benchmark lost 0.2% this week.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 lost 37.54 points, or 1.1%, closing at 3,319.47. As a result, the broad-based index gave back 1.3% this week. </p><p>The Nasdaq Composite ended 116.99 points lower, or 1.1%, at 10,793.28. The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 2.0% this week. </p><p>\"It has been a bit of a slog for the stock market so far on this quadruple witching options expiration day. Once again, that has a good bit to do with the performance of the mega-cap, growth, momentum stocks, which are mostly on the defensive,\" Briefing.com said. </p><p>Apple gave back 3.2%, Amazon lost 1.8%, Microsoft shed 1.2%, Alphabet 2.4% and Facebook 0.9%. </p><p>Briefing.com continued: \"Some of today's rotation away from the mega-cap, growth, momentum stocks is likely related to options-expiration activity, but another component perhaps is the news that the Department of Commerce said the US is going to block downloads of the TikTok and WeChat apps, effective September 20, as well as services for transferring funds or processing payments within the US using WeChat.\"</p><p>US officials described Friday's measures as essential to national security as President Donald Trump confronts Beijing on a number of fronts amid a tough re-election campaign.</p><p>\"The Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the US,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.</p><p>TikTok denounced the order and said it would continue to fight the Trump administration's crackdown.</p><p>\"We disagree with the decision from the Commerce Department,\" the company said Friday, adding that it was \"disappointed\" in a ban on new downloads that takes effect on Sunday, saying it impedes a tool \"for entertainment, self-expression and connection.\"</p><p>That timeframe potentially allows for a tie-up between TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, and a US company ordered by the Trump administration to safeguard data for the popular entertainment app.</p><p>Despite the planned ban from Sunday, Trump said Friday he expected an agreement soon on TikTok to allay security concerns voiced by his administration.</p><p>\"I think it could go quickly. We have great companies talking to us about it,\" Trump said. </p><p>Trump said that under any deal, \"We have to have the total security from China. We're not going to do anything to jeopardise security.\"</p><p>Oracle is currently in the drivers seat to get the deal done after Microsoft pulled out of any potential acquisition during the week. </p><p>Oracle lost 0.7% Friday. </p><p>Beyond Meat lost 5.2% Friday after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral, with a price target of USD122. The stock ended Friday USD148.14. </p><p>Briefing.com, however, believe the firm is an \"attractive long-term growth story\". </p><p>\"In the US, according to the Mintel Report, the non-dairy milk (almond milk, soy milk, etc.) category is equivalent to 13% of the overall dairy milk category. By applying this to the plant-based meat category, Beyond Meat believes it can grow its industry to be at least the same proportion of the USD270 billion meat category in the US, which over time would represent a category size of USD35 billion,\" Briefing.com added. </p><p>Briefing.com expects more analyst downgrades for Beyond Meat, due to its \"lofty valuation\".  </p><p>\"It's difficult to get excited about Beyond Meat at these levels, but it will certainly be an exciting story to watch unfold in the coming years,\" Briefing.com said. </p><p>Tiffany staged an afternoon rally, closing up 1.0%, after its ongoing M&amp;A saga with LVMH took another turn. </p><p>LVMH lost 1.5% in Paris on Friday. </p><p>LVMH said it has submitted the acquisition for approval from European regulators.</p><p>The pair are currently entangled in a legal battle, after Tiffany accused LVMH of dragging its heel over the deal. In late November last year, Tiffany agreed to be bought by LVMH for USD16.2 billion. The bid was priced at USD135 per share in cash.</p><p>Earlier in September, Tiffany said it would take legal action against LVMH after the takeover of the US jeweller turned nasty. Tiffany accused LVMH of \"concerted efforts\" to delay the deal.</p><p>In a statement Friday, however, LVMH said: \"LVMH confirms that earlier today, immediately after receiving approval to proceed by the European Commission, it has submitted the proposed acquisition of Tiffany for antitrust review, as it has always stated it would do.\"</p><p>In Europe, FTSE 100 in London closed down 0.7%, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.7% and the CAC 40 in Paris closed 1.2% lower.</p><p>In Asia on Thursday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended up 0.2%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 2.1%, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong advanced 0.5%.</p><p>The pound was quoted at USD1.2919 in London, soft from USD1.2971 at the New York close Thursday.</p><p>The euro was changing hands at USD1.1850 at the close, up slightly from USD1.1848 late Thursday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was trading at JPY104.60, down from JPY104.69 at the same time on Thursday.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate oil was quoted at USD40.84 a barrel at the close, down from USD41.06 a barrel late Thursday, while Brent oil was trading at USD42.93, lower from USD43.30 from Thursday's close.</p><p>Gold was quoted at USD1,950.80 an ounce at the New York equities close Friday, higher against USD1,948.80 late Thursday.</p><p>A quiet economic calendar next week is headlined by a slew of PMIs on Wednesday, with Japan's Jibun Bank manufacturing flash PMI at 0930 JST, followed by Markit flash composite PMIs from Germany at 0930 CEST, the eurozone at 1000 CEST, the UK at 0930 BST and the US at 0945 EST.</p><p>Also of note next week, financial markets in Japan are closed Monday and Tuesday as the country celebrates Respect for the Aged Day.</p><p>Focus in US corporate calendar will be on Nike first quarter results on Tuesday, following by Trip.com and Costco quarterly earnings on Thursday. </p><p>By Paul McGowan;

Yes. Thank you, Kayleigh.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should -- quote -- \"absolutely not\" -- unquote -- be allowed back into the G7. Does President Trump agree with Mitch McConnell?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCENANY: Look, I haven't spoken to him on that matter. The president believes that we have to have diplomatic relationship -- relations with the top economies of the world. But there's been no one that's been tougher on Russia than this president. I went through several of those actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And also, I would note that when it comes to acting on viable, actionable, credible intelligence, there has been no one who has acted more forcefully than this president. He has a track record of that. He has made protecting our American troops overseas his highest and strongest priority.</p><p>As you know, Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of 600 Americans and thousands maimed from, quote, explosively formed penetrators, other improvised explosive devices, improvised rocket-assisted munitions, rockets, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, small-arms, snipers, and other attacks in Iraq. This is what Soleimani did to our American troops.</p><p>You had President Bush, who declined to strike Soleimani, who was, quote in the crosshairs, according to the New York Times. You had Obama-Biden who, quote, never made an effort to strike Soleimani.</p><p>But you had this president who, when he had actionable intelligence to protect American troops, he did it. He took that option. He was criticized by Democrats. Democrats condemn Trump's strike on Soleimani, as your publication, Axios, had in a headline. NBC said, Democrats demand answers on Soleimani killing. Politico, Top Democrats blast Trump's 'false' justification for Soleimani killing. And the Atlantic asked, Why Kill Soleimani Now?</p><p>We removed Soleimani from the battlefield -- President Trump did -- to protect our American troops, based on credible intelligence. He did the same with al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for 300 public beheadings, who killed thousands of captured prisoners of war. When this president had actionable intelligence, he took action, criticized by Democrats for it, but that's what this president does. He acts in defense of our American troops.</p><p>David.</p><p>QUESTION: You said it was targeted leaking in the New York Times. Who's doing the targeting and why are they doing it?</p><p>MCENANY: It's a -- it's a great question. But these are rogue intelligence officers who are imperiling our troops' lives.</p><p>We will not be able to get -- very likely not be able to get a consensus on this intelligence because of what was leaked to the New York Times. And you have both the NSC, ODNI, and CIA all noting what damage this leaks does, not just to the safety of our troops, which is paramount, but to the ability of the United States to aggregate information from our allies and have assets and have -- get this valuable information. So who's doing it? It's...</p><p>QUESTION: Are you saying members of the I.C. are going after Trump? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>MCENANY: It very possibly could be. And if that's the case, it is absolutely despicable.</p><p>QUESTION: Kayleigh...</p><p>MCENANY: Yes.</p><p>QUESTION: On that note, is the Trump administration doing anything or taking any action, like an audit of the I.C.? Or what steps are you planning on taking to try to find the source of the leaks?</p><p>MCENANY: Well, make no mistake: The DOJ has done several criminal leak referrals -- 120 in 2017, 88 in 2018, 104 on average, per year, under President Trump. So we do take those steps.</p><p>And we do have a president who, ultimately, when it comes down to the safety of our troops, he doesn't take impulsive action, he takes deliberate action. And we saw that in the killing of Soleimani and the killing of al- Baghdadi and the protecting of our troops. And at the same time, when you had Iran, who shot down a drone, he chose not to strike back in that instance. He chose to protect civilians, protect our troops. It was the measured response; it was a proportionate response.</p><p>And ultimately, the ultimate way to protect American troops is to not get into needless foreign wars. This president is on record for decades and decades and decades opposing -- opposing foreign wars. And Iraq is a great example, a 20 -- nearly two-decade war. You have this president who, when Washington was unanimous in saying, We're going into Iraq, this president said, No, that's not the right decision.</p><p>He's wound down our troop presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he's ultimately protected American troops and kept this country safe. And this president has a very strong foreign policy record to be incredibly proud of.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, well, that was short and sweet.</p><p>You have heard from Kayleigh McEnany, more or less dismissing these charges that the president was aware of a still disputed intelligence report that the Russians were placing bounty on U.S. soldiers and coalition forces soldiers, including the Australians and the Brits.</p><p>There has been no way to verify that. So we don't know how high up the chain of intelligence command it went or whether it ever reached the president's desk.</p><p>Keep in mind, there's always some caution about relaying information like this before you can check it out, for fear that whoever the president is would immediately act on potentially false intelligence.</p><p>She was also very quick to point out the progress the president has made in dealing with renegade elements certainly within the Middle East and pointed again and again to achievements of the president to make sure that she had American soldiers' back.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD, starting a little late today, just to let Kayleigh McEnany explain some of the comments that came up today.</p><p>On the coronavirus, for example, she was still saying that she believes we're making progress here, and so does the president. But it occurs on the same day that the president's likely challenger for the presidency, Joe Biden, took to a forum in Delaware today to say, the president has failed in its most basic mission, to protect the health and the well-being of the American people.</p><p>And all of this on the same day we had Dr. Fauci complaining about the fact that no one should take this very lightly. He wasn't talking about the president. In that case, he was talking about us and the fears that, if we don't handle this right, that this could quickly coalesce into something even more serious, about 100,000 deaths a week, if it were to metastasize here.</p><p>In the meantime, the read we got from those who were questioning Fauci and other officials is, this cautious approach is getting a little grating.</p><p>We're going to talk to Senator Rand Paul about that, says that Fauci has been playing it so guarded and so tentative, it's actually bordering on being irresponsible. The senator here on that.</p><p>We're going to have Joe Manchin here, the Democratic senator of West Virginia, who is no fan of the way this has been handled at the federal level, and not a fan of how the governor, the West Virginia governor, is handling it at the state level.</p><p>So, we have got a lot coming up here as we wrap up what was a robust quarter for stocks and a robust comeback for stocks, at that.</p><p>In the meantime, I want to go to Doug McKelway, who is very, very closely following how this president is dealing right now with challenges from his challenger that, when it comes to this virus and how he's been leading it, I think the message from Biden, Doug, was, too little, too late, and I would change that.</p><p>What's the fallout from what he said?</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, too little, too late.</p><p>He made a point of saying that, back in March, he offered a five-point plan for the -- dealing with the coronavirus, a five-point plan that the nation's leading epidemiologists are still basically talking about. That's the point he made.</p><p>But the bigger deal today for Joe Biden was that he came out of the proverbial basement. He started campaigning again actively, and he actually had a press conference for the first time in three months, give or take 90 days.</p><p>There are obvious reasons for that. The coronavirus has dramatically changed how campaigning is done in this election summer. But there are other factors.</p><p>First of all, Joe Biden is 77 years old. So, he is in that target range for the worst effects of the virus. But there had also been widespread speculation that he is perhaps enjoying staying at home because he's not subject to the constant exposure on television and to constant speculation about alleged cognitive decline.</p><p>I asked him specifically today, has he been tested for cognitive decline? And here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have been testing, and I'm constantly tested.</p><p>Look, all you got -- all you got to do is watch me, and I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: So, today may have signaled a return to a semblance of normal campaigning for Joe Biden. He said he wants to do more of these interactions with the press.</p><p>He also committed to three debates in the campaign season. I asked him also about the ongoing destruction of monuments across the country. And he offered this bit of a nuanced perspective:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I think the elected officials where those taxes are have a responsibility to move, put them in museums, get them down. But don't expect, if you have sitting in front of you after all these years, and we finally, finally are going through another phase of maybe responding to the systemic racism in America and what we have seen happen, is, don't be surprised if someone pulls down the statue of Jefferson Davis.</p><p>It's better that they do not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: He also offered a very clear contrast to the way the president is handling these allegations of a bounty by the Russians on the head of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>In regards to the presidential daily briefing, Biden said that he read the presidential daily briefing every day at his residence on Observatory Circle. And then, when he went to the White House for work, he would read it again, a clear contrast -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>That's alleging, of course, that this president does not. And so that can be disputed there.</p><p>Doug McKelway, thank you very, very much.</p><p>I want to go right now to Charlie Gasparino, because an issue that did not get as much coverage today when Joe Biden was making his remarks are his plan to raise taxes, because, no matter where you are right now, taxes are going to go up.</p><p>And whether you love Joe Biden or you love Donald Trump or you hate Joe Biden -- you get the drill -- invariably, taxes will go up. And that is something that is indisputable, Joe Biden himself indicating that with fund-raisers last night, who he acknowledged would not welcome that, but that he's got to do that.</p><p>So, Charlie, what kind of taxes are we talking about?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: I think he underplayed how many taxes he will raise and how much regulation is going to go on.</p><p>If Joe Biden becomes present, it will be -- it will probably be on an agenda that's much more progressive than even Obama, President Obama, his - - who he served with -- he was the vice president for President Obama -- enacted.</p><p>I mean, we will talk -- we're talking about massive regulations. We're talking about dismantling the entire Trump tax agenda, which was lower taxes for higher-income people and much lower corporate income tax. So we're talking about massive amounts of regulation.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Neil, will have a say in this new administration on various regulatory policies, maybe even tax policy. She might even be the Treasury secretary. We don't know. She's going to get something if he becomes -- and this is all presuppose he becomes president. There's a long time for that.</p><p>And these issues are something that could be very fertile ground for Donald Trump to attack, if he does -- if -- when -- during the debates, because let me tell you something, Neil.</p><p>To raise taxes massively coming out of this recession, to ramp up regulation massively coming out of what we're going through with the pandemic, which wasn't Donald Trump's fault -- I mean, it was handed to him. You could debate whether he did a good job handling it, but the lockdowns were not Donald Trump's fault.</p><p>They had to happen. But to sort of stymie the economy through massive government programs of regulation and taxes, it's probably not a smart thing to do. It will have an impact on the market. It's not having an impact now. It's because we're not close to it yet.</p><p>But I can tell you, I know for a fact, because I have been reporting this out for the last week, Wall Street brokerage firms are starting to get worried about how they're going to address the Biden economic agenda, how they're going to break it to their to their investors, hey, guys and gals, this is how you have to arrange your portfolio, because certain companies are going to get crushed on this, because they're going to get much higher taxes.</p><p>By the way, Joe Biden gets in there, the breakup of big tech, which I know the Trump administration's making noises in that in that direction, going after Google -- there's an active investigation of Google. There will probably be some sort of case against Google. We don't know how far- reaching it is.</p><p>But if Joe Biden gets in there, and Elizabeth Warren has his ear, well, guess what? They're going to attempt to break up big tech. And this all presupposes if Donald Trump -- if Joe Biden wins, that the Senate goes to the Democrats, which it will likely.</p><p>And that gives him a pretty clean slate to do what he wants. this is something investors really need to worry about. They should be talking to their financial advisers right now, because it is an issue that's going to come right at that -- if the polls stay this way, and then -- and we're in the fall, it's something that's going to -- it's -- you're going to have to decide on what to do -- back to you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Charlie Gasparino, thank you very much.</p><p>And, to Charlie's point, it's how people are feeling about this and the prospects of polls in the fall. That's when it comes closer to sticking. Markets are not really envisioning one thing or the other here.</p><p>As I always like to say, markets aren't red or blue. They're green. They like making money. They made a lot of it under Bill Clinton, a Democrat. They have been making a lot of it, even with the gyrations this crazy year, under Donald Trump.</p><p>So, jarring that would be jarring to them.</p><p>Art Hogan with us right now, the National Securities Corporation chief market strategist.</p><p>On that point, and after coming back, Art, to one of the best quarters we have seen since at least the 1980s, certainly for the Dow, all of them up double digits, a huge comeback, is it your sense right now the politics isn't coming into play right now? Maybe if these polls were sticking the way they are now, let's say, in August or September, it might be a different story, but play that out.</p><p>ART HOGAN, MARKET STRATEGIST: Yes, it's interesting. I think you framed that up perfectly.</p><p>First and foremost, I think we have got a lack of trust in polls. The polls got it wrong in 2016 about the presidential election.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: Certainly got it wrong in polling about Brexit.</p><p>So I clearly think that Wall Street looks at this and says, it's way too early. Let's start thinking about this as we head into August-September time frame, and when you can -- when you can credibly look at a poll and think it's telling you something.</p><p>The other thing that I thought you brought up which is very important is that the market has done over the last 50 years actually better under Democratic administrations than it has under Republican administrations in general.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: And when the market does (AUDIO GAP) one party in the White House and a different party in control of Senates. And that causes a lack of any major change.</p><p>Understand, this current administration took at least two years to get tax reform done. So, it's not as though -- I know Charlie brings up what we should be thinking about, but nothing happens that drastically, whether it's changes in regulation or changes in the tax code.</p><p>So, I would say investors understand that and say, yes, well, let's wait and see how this plays out. What does the world look like in August and September vs. where we look at the end of June?</p><p>CAVUTO: Art, about individual investors who are getting pretty scared around March and April, when we looked like we were freefalling into a pretty durable bear market, and then stopped that and reversed that, but their mood right now and the confidence that they are exhibiting right now, in this quarter in particular, after a bumpy start, what are you to make of that?</p><p>Have that have they gotten ahead of themselves? What?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, that's interesting.</p><p>So this quarter is almost a mirror image of the first quarter, where we had a pretty good month and two terrible months.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: And now we have got two terrible months and a pretty good month.</p><p>And what has happened over the course of the second quarter is, information has gotten sequentially better. On a month-over-month basis, we have gotten better numbers out of new cases covering COVID-19. We have got sequential better economic data. We have certainly heard about a lot of stimulus, both monetary and fiscal.</p><p>So, I think all those things combine to say, the second half likely looks better than the first half did. And I think that instills confidence that, hey, it's not great right now. None of the economic data is great, but it's certainly better than it was last month and the month before that.</p><p>And I think investors are looking and saying, OK, I bet 2021 is going to be better than 2020 was.</p><p>So, right now, I think that's the way investors are thinking. It's interesting, though, how quickly we rotate. We have had several rotations where technology has been the leadership -- and this happened almost for the entire quarter -- and then for about three weeks, we rotated into (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>HOGAN: And the same thing is happening again this week.</p><p>I think that shows that investors are very keen to make sure they're not overweight what has worked and start to get other things that might work as the economy slowly reopens.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, you mentioned slowly reopening. It's been staggered a little bit with spikes in cases in states like Texas and certainly in South Carolina, Arizona.</p><p>And I'm wondering now, even with California seeing an unprecedented spike, a record spike in new cases there, that the slow recovery and maybe the reemergence of a more stubborn virus, as Dr. Fauci was saying today, one that could turn on you fast, and produce a lot more deaths than we're seeing now, there's no way to plan for something like that, you know?</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, there really isn't.</p><p>I think we're trying to use other countries as a template and say, OK, this is how long it took for them to reopen. And we really can't do that. We're really having 50 openings, all at the same time, and all of that has been staggered.</p><p>New York went very slowly. And, obviously, New York is doing much better with single-digit new case discovery, largely the case with most of the Northeast.</p><p>Where some of the states that reopened a bit quicker a couple of months ago or eight weeks ago, call it, you're seeing in the South and the Southwest where there's been flare-ups. And I think that we need to learn from those experiences, tap on the brakes on the reopening plans, make sure we're ring-fencing the source of where the new cases are coming from.</p><p>But at the same time, hospitalization rates are going up and death rates are coming down, because the health care infrastructure has just gotten better. The standard of care for an admitted COVID-19 patient has changed over the last three months, such that the results are coming out better.</p><p>So, our therapeutic response is getting better and we're working rapidly towards a vaccine. So it's an experiment, but we're certainly getting there. And I think we're getting better in a lot of the phases.</p><p>So I don't know that we will ever go back to where we're all shut down again. I just think there's going to be a different pace for reopening.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, because I think, at that point, Art, my family's already sick of me, so I don't know if I want to push my luck, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Art Hogan, thank you very much, my friend, a very good read of things.</p><p>As Art pointed out, it's an important distinction. We are seeing a big spike in cases. But we're seeing a big decline in deaths throughout. I don't want to be morbid there, just to point out that the hike in cases is to be expected, maybe not to the extreme in some of these states.</p><p>But it's not corresponding, especially with the disproportionate number of young people affected, into fears that this is going to spiral into something very, very damning for a population that right now is seeing fewer deaths than it ever has, even in some of these states affected.</p><p>Back and forth on this and whether we're making progress at all with the coronavirus from Republican Senator Rand Paul and, fair and balanced, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, both very distinct views -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, going to Rockville, Maryland, soon. The vice president of the United States will be addressing coronavirus concerns right now, when he has urged people, for the better part of valor, go ahead and wear a mask.</p><p>His boss routinely does not. The president has always indicated people around him, said he's been tested many, many times, so no chance that he has the virus, so need to wear that. But Vice President Pence has made that an issue right now of where -- right now, given all the crackdowns in states to deal with problems, and then pickups in cases, now is probably a good time to consider doing that, rather than have the issue forced on you.</p><p>Let's go to Senator Joe Manchin on all of these developments, of the beautiful state of West Virginia.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi, Senator -- and it's very good to have you, by the way...</p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): Thanks, Neil. It's good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: ... has said, you know what, the mask thing is such a good idea, everyone should wear one in this country and make it a federal sort of a policy, everyone wears a mask.</p><p>Do you think that's a good idea?</p><p>MANCHIN: Well, I think -- you know, I have done a thing called mask up back home in West Virginia. And I think it is.</p><p>But it's a prudent thing. It's a safe thing. And it protects other people from each one of us. And I think it's a respectful thing to do.</p><p>So, with that being said, it's been told by the doctors and scientists that it does help, it would prevent the spread, and it's good for all of us, so anything that helps along those lines.</p><p>It's hard to open up a restaurant go to a restaurant with a mask on and eat -- eat your food or go to your bar with your beverage. So, I think they're going to have a harder time, until we get a handle with either an antibody or a vaccine, Neil, until they can open up safely.</p><p>But with that being said, that I think it's a good -- it's a good practice to have a mask on. Whether you're going to make it a federal law and a federal offense, I think that might be going a little bit too hard. But it would be great if the president would lead a little bit on this and show that it is a safe, prudent thing to do.</p><p>I try to do it all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>MANCHIN: I tried to go into CVS the other day in D.C., and if I didn't have the mask on, they wouldn't let me in.</p><p>So, I will tell you one thing. I didn't forget my mask anymore.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And they have to know who you are.</p><p>So, Senator, let me ask you a little bit about Joe Biden's comments today. He came out of his bunker, as some of his critics tell it, to really lambaste the president, and specifically over the handling of the coronavirus.</p><p>Do you think the president has botched it, as far as that response is concerned, and what the vice president had to say?</p><p>MANCHIN: Well, let me just say -- and I always try to be as respectful as I can. And I mean that. I think we all should be. The office basically deserves the respect it should receive.</p><p>With that, I couldn't ever figure out why the president did not declare Defense Production Act immediately, especially on all the equipment that was needed to protect us, the PPEs that the professionals needed and the hospitals and all the clinics and all the different essentials that we had still working.</p><p>And on top of that, I couldn't understand why we didn't have the Defense Production Act that made every possibility of a manufacturing who could do testing, manufacture testing, so that we could get a handle on it quickly.</p><p>And those things, I really think, could have been done a lot, lot quicker and a lot better along those lines there.</p><p>But, as they say, hindsight is 20/20. But that's something that I think that could have been done. It was there for us to use. And I think we could have used it a little bit more effectively.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think it was hyperbole, Senator, for Dr. Fauci to hint today, if we're not careful, we could rocket up to 100,000 coronavirus deaths a day? I think I mistakenly said earlier he was saying per week. He said a day.</p><p>Obviously, Rand Paul, who is going to come up, took him to task on that. But what do you make of the possibility of a dramatic resurgence even in your state?</p><p>MANCHIN: Well, we're seeing it.</p><p>First of all, I have all the respect for Dr. Fauci. I mean, he has been well, well respected for many, many years, in different many administrations, and in a nonpartisan way. So I take his advice really at heart, and I appreciate that.</p><p>With that being said, we're seeing it in areas of -- in West Virginia, we're a smaller state, a million -- a little over 1,800,000 people. So we have social distancing built in already, because we don't have any town bigger than 50,000. So we're a state of towns.</p><p>With that being said, we're seeing a spike in certain areas and rural areas, because people pretty much have become nonchalant, thinking, hey, everything's OK now. And it's not OK.</p><p>So, now we're seeing, as the reopening went phase two, they're starting to pull back a little bit, Neil, because of that. So I'm telling people, we have the most vulnerable state in the nation. It's been addressed as being the most vulnerable state, because we have an elderly population.</p><p>And these were hardworking people that gave so much to their -- to this country and to their families, if they have a lot of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But a lot of those people have been protected, we're told, Senator, with the CARES Act. And you have been critical about whether that money has reached them or been wasted.</p><p>MANCHIN: Oh, I'm -- it's...</p><p>CAVUTO: Can you update us on that?</p><p>MANCHIN: Neil, I can.</p><p>Right now, over 22 states haven't even distributed the money we have given them. My state has just been really Johnny-come-lately, state of West Virginia. And we have been pushing the governor to please get that out to where it's supposed to.</p><p>Well, guess what they did? They announced yesterday, and with $1.25 billion -- up until now, it was, I think, $14 million was given out about of $1.25 billion. Yesterday, he announced how he's going to roll it all out.</p><p>Six -- over $600 million to $700 million of it will go back to the state for workers' comp and the amount of workers comp situation and demand that we have; $100 million, he's putting into highway, COVID-related highway.</p><p>I don't know of a pothole that's had the COVID virus. I haven't found one yet. So, how they're using it for highways and potholes, and not using it for people, is beyond me...</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>MANCHIN: ... and having all our little municipalities and our counties and cities.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>MANCHIN: So, I'm a little bit reluctant when we start saying, let's put more money and just put more money to it. Let's make sure what we have done has worked. And what hasn't worked, let's fix it.</p><p>CAVUTO: First find out where the money...</p><p>MANCHIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: First find out where this money went.</p><p>MANCHIN: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Senator, I want to thank you very much.</p><p>We're going to reach out to the governor's office to find out more about this.</p><p>In the meantime, Senator Joe Manchin, thank you very much.</p><p>Fair and balanced, we're going to hear from Senator Rand Paul, a real moment today on Capitol Hill, when he and Dr. Fauci went at it.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, things getting rocky in New York City today, as they move on a measure to defund the New York City Police Department, not entirely, but how about $1.5 billion taken away?</p><p>It's not going down well -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Dr. Fauci, every day, virtually every day, we seem to hear from you things we can't do.</p><p>But when you're asked, can we go back to school, I don't hear much certitude at all. I hear, well, maybe. It depends.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: If you were listening -- and I think you were -- to my opening statement and my response to one of the questions, I feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get the children back to school.</p><p>So, I think we are in lock agreement with that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: One of the more heated moments of today's coronavirus members meeting before the Senate.</p><p>Rand Paul was the one asking the questions of Dr. Fauci, that he might be a little bit too tentative, a little too guarded, and a little too unclear in this particular case about allowing kids to return to school.</p><p>The senator with us right now.</p><p>Senator Paul, thank you for coming.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: He seemed to say, that is, Dr. Fauci, that you guys are kind of on the same page. You were pointing out that you're not, because he's not more unequivocal, I guess, right?</p><p>PAUL: You know, I think we got more out of him. I think it takes a little bit to draw out of Dr. Fauci. But, in the end, he did seem to be agreeing with me.</p><p>But my point is this. The scientific evidence is overwhelming that kids rarely get the disease, kids rarely die from the disease, and, actually, even more extraordinary, they rarely transmit the disease.</p><p>But here's the problem. You got scientists at the WHO who said -- who said this. A scientist came on, and she gave a press conference and said this, but you know what they did? They shut her down.</p><p>And because political correctness rules everywhere, they actually deleted the link to the studies that pointed out that this was rare.</p><p>So, I think this is a rare bit of good news. And we should be happy for children. But we need to send them to school. And in -- frankly, many of the schools in Europe are going back without masks. Many of them are going out with modified, if any, social distancing, and kids are not causing a spike.</p><p>I listed eight different countries, and we showed the chart where, guess what, there was no spike when they opened the schools.</p><p>CAVUTO: There have been spikes for other reasons in other areas in a number of states, about a dozen of them right now that have seen double- digit increases in cases, Senator.</p><p>And I'm wondering whether you agree with the governors in those states who are scaling back reopenings and phased reopenings, and, in the case of Texas, partly Florida, they're reversing them.</p><p>PAUL: I think it's unknown right now.</p><p>There are -- there definitely are increased cases. There is more testing, but I do believe there are more cases. But the thing we don't know yet is, is it having a really terrible effect? Are we going to have an increased death rate?</p><p>If you just have cases, and the average age is 37, and there's virtually no or no mortality, you could make the argument that we are increasing our herd immunity for the country.</p><p>And so I guess I'm not as alarmed as some. I'm not saying it's nothing. I'm saying we don't yet know. They say that the death rate lags. That's true. But we're two or three, even four weeks into a lot of the opening. The increased cases have been going on for a while.</p><p>And I think it's very good news. I think we shouldn't always have bad news that we talk about. It's very much good news that the average age is 37, and that the vast majority of them are surviving.</p><p>If you look at the statistics from the Netherlands, at age 37, or even at age 47, 95 to 97 percent were either mildly affected or asymptomatic. So, the odds are good with this disease, and we need to not keep scaring people.</p><p>I mean, this is the point with opening schools. They're now scaring teachers such that teachers don't want to go back to school, and they're going to refuse to teach. And yet the facts, the scientific evidence are, kids rarely transmit this to adults. Kids don't catch it very often. Kids don't get sick.</p><p>And so all the worry about grandma, kids need to go to school. Don't send the kids to the nursing home. I mean, we have to do what we can to protect those in the nursing home, but doesn't mean we shouldn't kids back -- send the kids back to school.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, well, fair enough.</p><p>Then you talk about practical advice that people should honor, rather than wait for an edict from the government. And one concerns masks, whether you should wear -- wear masks.</p><p>The vice president, who is speaking right now in Maryland, is advocating that, yes, push comes to shove, probably a good idea. The president doesn't wear a mask. And I get the reasoning. Part of his rationale is, he's been tested again and again and again, he doesn't have it, he's not going to give it to anyone.</p><p>But is it a good example to set? Do you think the president should wear it, or is he pushing a cavalier attitude where a lot of people say, well, the heck with it, if he's not wearing it, I'm not wearing it?</p><p>PAUL: Well, you know, I'm old enough to remember when the CDC -- the CDC said we were idiots for wearing masks, and now they say we're criminals.</p><p>I think the answer is somewhere in between. I think, if you're immunocompromised, you should avoid crowds. I think, if you are elderly, you should avoid crowds. And I think if you're 20 years old, I think the same prescription isn't there.</p><p>So, the people who want to tell every 20-year-old that you are going to have to stay inside and stay away from people forever or until there's a vaccine, and no vaccine comes, this is the new normal, I am really just not for that.</p><p>But I am for individual responsibility. Everybody every day, do you want to get in a car? Do you want to ride a motorcycle? Do you want to ride a bike in D.C.? Do you want to walk in D.C.? Do you want to jaywalk in D.C.?</p><p>All of the decisions we make in our life involve risks. And really, for young people, the risk of death from accidents and other things are as high or higher sometimes than some of the risks from infectious disease.</p><p>So I'm for individual choice. And there are people who should wear masks. And then there are other times in which it's sort of Kabuki theater and may or may not be doing anything to change the rate of what's going on.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you don't see people taking those commonsense measures, to just be aware of the crowds around you, distancing and all of that, what do you think of governors who force the issue, like, in New Jersey, where the governor just said, all right, I'm holding off on indoor dining, because you guys aren't listening?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAUL: Well, the thing is, is, they really don't have any scientific evidence on their side to say, oh, if you seat every other seat on the airplane, you have reduced infection. There's just no science to that.</p><p>That's what we're doing now. And even the airlines are pushing back and saying, well, what is your science?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAUL: Same with restaurants. I mean, what if eight people are in the same family and they hang out with their neighbors? Can we not let them make the decision?</p><p>Neighbors are getting together all over America. We're not telling Big Brother, but neighbors get together, and they have picnics, and they associate with people and extended families. That is happening.</p><p>So, when you go to a restaurant, you're not allowed to sit with those people? There are some absurdities to this thing. But I'm not saying you shouldn't take precautions. If you are in a nursing home or have cancer or are immunocompromised or someone your family is, take extra precautions, by all means.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAUL: But I don't like the one-size-fits-all. I'm against mandatory masks.</p><p>I'm against -- I'm against most of the government mandates on your personal behavior. I think we should be largely left free. It doesn't mean that we should ignore advice, but we should remember that we're a free country. That's what we were founded on, is freedom of choice.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, very good having you back. Be well. Be safe.</p><p>PAUL: Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: Rand Paul of the beautiful state of Kentucky. All right.</p><p>We're a little more than an hour away from a crucial vote going on in New York as to whether they should start taking money out of the police budget. It's about a $6 billion budget. They're talking about stripping $1.5 billion of that into other programs like for the young, et cetera.</p><p>But it is as divisive as you can get, and nasty too.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: One billion dollars is shifted away from the NYPD in a variety of manners.</p><p>We will be canceling the upcoming recruit class that would have started in July. And we're going to make sure that patrol strength is consistent by reassignments from administrative duty to patrol duty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, and so it has begun.</p><p>Looking live right now at New York City Hall, where a lot of folks are getting ready for what will be a very, very big vote later on today.</p><p>I'm sorry. That is not live. This is live. I apologize for that.</p><p>But the issue is the funding mechanism that they're voting on here where they're going to channel at least a billion dollars of the $6 billion police budget in New York into youth services programs and the like. And that will mean forestalling another class for incoming or potentially incoming police officers.</p><p>Depending on who you talk to, that doesn't always go down very well.</p><p>Let's get the latest read on all of this, Aishah Hasnie in the middle of it all in New York City -- Aishah.</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>So, that vote happens in just over an hour from now. And, so far, things have been pretty calm here at City Hall Park, where protesters are anticipating, anxiously waiting for that vote to come down. We will see here in just a little while.</p><p>Earlier this morning, though, a completely different story. We did see some clashes between protesters and some police officers that showed up in riot gear. One person was arrested for assaulting an officer this morning.</p><p>The mayor's plan would slash the NYPD's budget by a billion dollars and cancel, as you mentioned, an upcoming recruit class, with those dollars now going to youth and community programs. The mayor says he can make all of these cuts all while keeping the city safe.</p><p>But the police union feels differently, of course. They're pointing to a surge in shootings and violent crime across the city. And that is exactly why not every council member will be voting yes tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BORELLI (R), NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL: We are undoing everything we did to make New York City the place I like to live and the place that so many people like to visit. And it's just a sad day for New York. And I'm confident that this vote will be replicated in so many of America's large cities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASNIE: Now, even if the budget passes with the $1 billion in police cuts, a New York City public advocate is threatening to use his powers to block the execution of that budget in order to get more budget cuts in place.</p><p>But we will see what happens. Again, that vote happens at 6:00 tonight -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Aishah, thank you very, very much. Great reporting, as always.</p><p>In the meantime, you might have heard of other cities and states that are taking measures and going in reverse. Miami Beach is a good example of that. If you want to hit the beaches there over the weekend, good luck. They will be closed.</p><p>The Miami Beach mayor on why that is -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Miami Beach, home of sun and fun, but, for this weekend, no open beaches, at least in Miami Beach proper.</p><p>Dan Gelber is the Democratic mayor of that beautiful city, joins us right now.</p><p>Governor, this was a gut call, I guess in coordination with others as well. What's the reason for it?</p><p>Well, the county mayor closed all the beaches.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mayor. I apologize, sir. Go ahead.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAN GELBER (D), MAYOR OF MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA: Yes.</p><p>The county mayor closed all the beaches. And I agree with what he did. We're a destination city. We -- small city of 92,000, we get hundreds of thousands of people here. And they come to the beach, for the restaurants, for the promenades.</p><p>And there has not been at all the kind of compliance with social distancing and masks we'd hoped for. And all of our metrics are going in the wrong direction in the county, in the state, obviously, increase in hospitalizations, in ICU patients, obviously, with positive cases.</p><p>So, I think this is an action we needed to take, frankly, to avoid having to do what ultimately maybe something we don't want to, which is to return to a shelter in place.</p><p>CAVUTO: How do you police something like that, Mayor?</p><p>I mean, do they have local police officers saying, all right, guys spread out, or what? It depends, I guess, on the city and the beach. But what do you do to try to contain it? Because, obviously, a lot of people were doing a lot of things they shouldn't have been.</p><p>GELBER: Well, until today, actually, really, the only thing we could do is arrest somebody, and we haven't done that and we wouldn't do that, for not wearing a mask.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>GELBER: So, we created a $50 fine that hopefully will give us something to enforce with.</p><p>But, more importantly, we're sending ambassadors out with masks to give away, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, if necessary, in all the major promenades, so the people that may be congregating, somebody, a police officer, presumably, or an ambassador will walk up to and say, listen, why don't you use these masks if you're going to not exercise the proper social distance outside?</p><p>CAVUTO: Mayor, do you worry, though, the impact will be, people are going to hear of it, not only in the area, but those who would love to come to your beautiful city, and say, the heck with it, I'm not going to come because I don't know whether the beaches are going to be opened or closed, whatever?</p><p>GELBER: Well, it's a good point.</p><p>But we have to decide between lives and livelihood, trying to strike a balance. We did open up. And I think, unfortunately, when we opened up, it seemed like a green light to people that this was over and they could -- and it was an all-clear. And it really wasn't.</p><p>So I don't think we have really a choice here, because I'm a small city. We have a nursing home in South Beach. Thirteen people died in just that one facility.

My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work. - DHH (@dhh) November 7, 2019<br/><br/>AppleCard is a joint venture between Apple and Goldman Sachs which was launched earlier this year. Sachs is responsible for all the credit decisions on the card.<br/><br/>What happened?<br/><br/>David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish tech entrepreneur, on November 8, had tweeted his ire at how, despite having a worse credit score than his wife, he is allowed a 20X more credit limit than she is. Highlighting the problem of black boxed algorithms that replicate real world biases, he also pointed out that customer service couldn't also do much in this case since \"it's just the algorithm\".<br/><br/>She spoke to two Apple reps. Both very nice, courteous people representing an utterly broken and reprehensible system. The first person was like \"I don't know why, but I swear we're not discriminating, IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM\". I shit you not. \"IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM!\". - DHH (@dhh) November 8, 2019<br/><br/>6 different representatives across Apple, and Goldman Sachs have no visibility into this black boxed algorithm. As the thread gained traction on social media and turned into a PR disaster for the company, Apple raised Hansson's wife's credit limit to match his. But such a \"VIP bump\" doesn't resolve the underlying issue of algorithmic bias.<br/><br/>I wasn't even pessimistic to expect this outcome, but here we are: @AppleCard just gave my wife the VIP bump to match my credit limit, but continued to be an utter fucking failure of a customer service experience. Let me explain - DHH (@dhh) November 8, 2019<br/><br/>Hansson also pointed out that since this discrimination is a result of a proprietary algorithm, \"there will be no recourse, no accountability because any review of our biases and processes is an invasion of our business privileges\". Steve Wozniak, Apple's co-founder, also said that he got 10X the credit limit than his wife.<br/><br/>The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019. - Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) November 10, 2019<br/><br/>New York State regulator orders probe<br/><br/>Linda A. Lacewell, the superintendent of NYSDFS, announced the probe in a Medium post on November 11. As she cited New York law, that prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals, even if it done via an algorithm. She also cited another investigation by DFS wherein an algorithm sold by a UnitedHealth Group subsidy allegedly led to less comprehensive care for black patients than white patients.<br/><br/>In response to the online maelstrom, Goldman Sachs CEO Carey Halio issued a statement earlier this morning wherein he said that during the AppleCard application process, the company is not aware of gender or marital status.<br/><br/>'Need equality, justice, transparency and fairness,' says Jamie<br/><br/>Jamie Heinemeier Hansson, Hansson's wife, wrote a blog post on his website \"lest [she] be cast as a meek housewife who cannot speak for herself\". Shedding light on her financial status, she wrote that she had higher credit score than her husband's, had a successful career, and despite identifying as a \"homemaker\" on her tax returns, was still a millionaire in her own right \"who contributes greatly to my household and pays off credit in full each month\".<br/><br/>Jamie also recognised her own privilege in the fact that the Apple manager, on learning about David's viral tweets, raised her credit limit without resolving the underlying issue. \"This is not merely a story about sexism and credit algorithm blackboxes, but about how rich people nearly always get their way,\" she wrote.<br/><br/>Looking at algorithmic bias<br/><br/>Black boxed algorithms, both digital and analog, have long been used to determine people's credit worthiness, and in a Black Mirror-esque situation, their social worthiness. The datasets that buttress a lot of these algorithms themselves replicate and perpetuate prejudices of the real world. As digital algorithms get more complex, fewer people completely understand the causal relationship between datasets, the algorithm, and the consequences of its operation. As a result, the most affected people are the ones who are already discriminated against.<br/><br/>American lawmakers have sponsored a bill, the Algorithmic Accountability Act, that seeks to assess the algorithms that power large companies for bias.<br/><br/>If you want to read more about algorithmic bias, you can look at this Twitter thread.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0050350086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGN-4XC1-JB5M-W0KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Kirsten Gillibrand wants the United States government more involved in protecting digital privacy, and she wants to create a new federal agency to do it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gillibrand (D-NY) proposed legislation Thursday to create a Data Protection Agency at the federal level. In an outline of her proposal, published on the official Senate Medium account, Gillibrand said the independent federal agency \u201cwould serve as a \u2018referee\u2019 to define, arbitrate, and enforce rules\u201d related to protecting personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAs our country and economy continue to evolve with the digital age, we face a national crisis as our personal data gets targeted\u2014and not just for marketing by brands, but also to establish if we can access certain jobs, loans, or prices on products,\u201d Gillibrand wrote. \u201cAmericans should be able to go to an institution that will look out for, and actively work to protect, their privacy and freedom.\u201d</p><p>Gillibrand\u2019s proposed Data Protection Agency, CNBC reported, would work as an independent agency headed up by a director who, after being appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would serve a five-year term. The agency would have number of powers, including the ability to enforce data protection rules through methods like injunctive relief or civil penalties up to $1 million per day. The bill would promote data protection and privacy innovation within the digital marketplace by providing resources for companies, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies, and the agency would advise Congress on emerging technology challenges, such as deepfake technology.</p><p>The agency would have the authority to launch data privacy investigations on any company it receives complaints about, including tech giants Google and Facebook, and can then share its findings to the public. The agency would also protect against \u201cpay-for-privacy\u201d or \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d provisions that are often woven into the contracts tech companies require customers to sign before using their services.</p><p>With the proposal, Gillibrand becomes the latest legislator at the federal level to introduce legislation aimed at addressing consumer privacy. Lawmakers from both Democratic and Republican parties have introduced draft bills aimed at detailing consumers\u2019 rights over their own data and outline how major companies can and cannot collect and use personal data.</p><p>For example, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced legislation in 2019 to give the FTC the authority to update 50-year-old privacy laws, whereas Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) put together a robust plan to legislate Big Tech as part of her presidential bid.</p><p>Gillibrand\u2019s proposal, though, stands out in that it would delegate enforcement to the new agency instead of delegating enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission. (Democratic reps. Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren introduced a similar bill in November that would create a Digital Privacy Agency that would serve a similar purpose.) Most other lawmakers have routed compliance and enforcement through the Federal Trade Commission; some lawmakers have considered giving the FTC rule-making authority to directly address privacy.</p><p>It\u2019s unlikely a bill of this scope will pass this year. While there seems to be a bipartisan appetite to tackle the issue, Republicans and Democrats have long squabbled over the details, including whether or not federal laws will preempt the increasingly large patchwork of state laws regulating and privacy and data collection, and whether individual consumers should be given a private right of action to sue major companies. An already contentious election year makes the passage of bills of this scope particularly unlikely.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1123814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6M-19C1-JC8H-T35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They evaporated. There are losses in the afternoon, and we are down at the moment. Not any huge amount, but it does beg the question whether the five-day winning spree is going to come to an end and it certainly looks like it. Small losses, but the market is not terribly happy, and those are the markets. And these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump says we'd have nothing without tariffs. I'll have an exclusive interview with his top trade adviser. Peter Navarro joins me from the White House. A power struggle on Capitol Hill. The first hearings on big tech is underway and market downgrade beyond painful, Beyond Meat off more than 20 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are live in the world's financial capital, New York City on a stunning day. It is Tuesday, the 11th of June. I am Richard Quest. I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, Donald Trump is defending his use of tariffs as weapons. The U.S. President pulled his tariff threat on Mexico at the last minute over immigration policy. Now his hour is back, this time pivoting towards China once again.</p><p>Speaking a short time ago on the South Lawn of the White House, he said tariffs are a great negotiating tool. And the saga with Mexico is proof he can flex America's economic muscle to get what you want on the international stage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Without the tariffs, we would have had nothing. We had nothing two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I'll tell you what we had. We had nothing. And the reason we had nothing is because Mexico felt they didn't have to give us anything. I don't blame them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So I'm joined for an exclusive interview by the White House's foremost advocate on trade and tariffs, Peter Navarro, an assistant to Donald Trump and the Director of Policy of the Office of the Fair Trade Policy at the White House.</p><p>Peter, good to see you, sir. Thank you for giving us time.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR OF POLICY, OFFICE OF THE FAIR TRADE POLICY: It's been too long, sir. I remember during the campaign, your wonderful studio there, I don't know you paid, but that studio is the best in New York. Apologies to everybody else, but I loved that then.</p><p>QUEST: And our new one is even better, you have an open invitation to come and visit. Now, on the question of Mexico and the trade tariffs. The decision to use tariffs has been widely criticized as taking tariffs from an economic tool to one for immigration and thereby other purposes.</p><p>NAVARRO: So what we have unquestionably at the border is a national security and an emergency. What we have is a situation where Congress has refused to act and prior to last week, Mexico had refused to act.</p><p>It was totally appropriate to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in the way that President Trump did. And as President Trump has correctly said, Mexico refused to do in 20 years what it only took about two days to get us to do with the prospect of tariffs.</p><p>We see it -- the tariffs, Richard have multi uses. In some cases, they are simply a defense of our national security, for example, in the case of steel and aluminum tariffs, a similar use is in China where we're trying to defend ourselves against practices, like forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, the use of unfair subsidies in state-owned enterprises.</p><p>And in the Mexican case, clearly, this was an appropriate regulatory response to a terrible situation and we got a great outcome out of it.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, but it is what is being described as the weaponization of tariffs. You're taking them and essentially bullying another country on the threat of a tariff.</p><p>NAVARRO: Those who are using that term are simply those who are opposed to our policy in general. It's the Chamber of Commerce, it's the multinational corporations. It's the anti-tariff crowd who have seen our jobs go offshore and have American use as what President Trump has correctly called the piggy bank for the rest of the world.</p><p>So that term -- look, throw that away. What I see today behind me is a beautiful weather and a lawn at the White House, a very bullish economy. We've got seven million jobs out there available for Americans and only five million people seeking jobs.</p><p>We've got an epic low unemployment rate. We've got investment pouring into this country.</p><p>[15:05:10] NAVARRO: This is bullish and tariffs are an important part of the President's strategy to bring about the economic renewal and manufacturing Renaissance were seen in this country.</p><p>QUEST: Some people suggest the President doesn't fully understand how tariffs work. Well, let me read you --</p><p>NAVARRO: Come on now.</p><p>QUEST: No, come on.</p><p>NAVARRO: He is smartest guy in the room. He is the smartest guy that is sitting in the Oval Office on the economy and business in a hundred years. I can't think of anybody who is smarter than he is on this show. I'm not going down that road with you.</p><p>QUEST: Well, he says, we have so much money that is pouring into our Treasury right now.</p><p>NAVARRO: $17 billion we have raised to date on the tariffs. And by the way -- by the way, the people who are paying those, that money are the countries that tariffs are levied against.</p><p>China clearly bears the burden of the tariffs. They bear most of the burden in the form of lower prices for their products. Fewer exports lower profits. The Chinese government itself is having to devalue its currency out of desperation.</p><p>We have the Chinese government that is facing lower tax revenues. And meanwhile, I would point out in Q1, we had a 3.2 percent real GDP growth rate. And guess what? A full one point of that was due to our reduction in the trade deficits primarily because of the China tariffs. Tariffs are good.</p><p>QUEST: You accept that the strict operation of the tariff is paid by the importer, which is then just passed on to the distributor, and ultimately, the American consumer.</p><p>NAVARRO: Now, of course, come on, you know, better than that. This is a task in what's called tax incidence analysis. Let's say for example, I'm an American consumer, I pay $100.00 for a product from China before the tariff, if I'm still paying $100.00 after the tariff, it's because China has lowered their price and bitten that bullet and devalued their currency. In that case, I, as an American consumer didn't pay a cent more.</p><p>QUEST: Correct, but the evidence is --</p><p>NAVARRO: There is no inflation in this economy.</p><p>QUEST: The evidence, Peter, is that one of two things are happening, U.S. corporations are cutting margins to account for that tariff or they are passing it on.</p><p>NAVARRO: Not U.S. corporations my friend unless they're setting up in China and selling back here, which we don't want to happen -- bring your jobs home.</p><p>But if it's a giant corporation, we're not shedding any tears for a China corporation that uses all sorts of government subsidies to dump products into this market.</p><p>Look, here's the thing. China is paying for the China tariffs not American consumers. There's no inflation in this economy. We're in a virtuous cycle. This is why things are so bullish. And the stock it is reflecting that.</p><p>QUEST: All right, let's talk about China, what might happen next? Please, I know your time is tight. But please have a listen to what the President said today. And we can discuss it after. Have a listen, sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Right now, China wants to make a deal very badly. It's me right now that's holding up the deal. And we're going to either do a great deal with China, or we're not doing a deal at all. Right now, China is paying us billions and billions of dollars. They never gave us 10 cents. And China ate our country alive during Obama and Biden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: What are you now waiting for from the Chinese to do the deal? The President said he is now the one that is waiting. Waiting for what?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, look, you know, the history of this, we go back to Mar-a- Lago at the beginning of this administration. We've given the Chinese many, many opportunities to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>And we had 150-page plus agreement across seven verticals, including the forced technology transfer and the intellectual property theft, and they reneged on that at the end. So that's where we are.</p><p>I don't want to say any more than that, other than to say that we've got the President of the United States is the best negotiator in the world, with a left-handed in Robert E. Lighthizer as the USTR, as the finest negotiator I've ever met in the trenches, basically working with the Chinese, and we'll see what happens and we'll either get a great deal or we'll get tariffs. Simple.</p><p>QUEST: But finally, I just want to ask you, this sort of psychological, philosophical, geopolitical, whatever posh word we want to use of the United States, using tariffs in this way, dragging effectively, humiliating Mexico, dragging them to Washington.</p><p>NAVARRO: We did not humiliate Mexico. We got their attention. We love the Mexicans. The President of Mexico and our President get along great.</p><p>[15:10:07] NAVARRO: They know that there's a crisis. As the President said, look, they had no incentive to do what they did until we gave them the incentive. So I mean, this tariff policy is working. It's simply a negotiating tool that we use when we need to use it, and it's getting people to the table.</p><p>Look, one thing I should say, the American people are behind this President. A recent Harvard Harris poll came out just a few days ago, and it showed that a majority of people in this country support our tariffs on China, and close to 80 percent of Republicans are behind this President on the China tariffs.</p><p>They understand, everybody in America understands that China has been eating our lunch and raiding our piggy bank. And one of the best successes I think of this President has been to change the narrative and dialogue on China in a mere two years. Before this, it was like, let's engage with China. They take our lunch.</p><p>QUEST: Peter, last question.</p><p>NAVARRO: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: You must be, I suppose impressed is the word. You came into this White House. Tariffs by and large have been a dirty word in economics since Smoot-Hawley, you know, they've been very targeted. They've been -- but now they are part, a fundamental part of the United States industrial or trade policy. Do you take much credit for that?</p><p>NAVARRO: No, not at all. I would say in our history, sir, you go back to the days of McKinley and Jefferson and Lincoln. Tariffs were what made this country great, and we have a situation here, where around the world, countries are allowed to systematically charge us higher tariffs.</p><p>My office, the Office of Trade Manufacturing Policy, just came out with a report, which showed that over two thirds of the time, American exporters faced higher tariffs on their products and we charge them the same or similar products.</p><p>So what we're trying to do, I mean, we're for free trade, but we're for fair, balanced and reciprocal trade. Tariffs are useful for -- defense tariffs are useful to get people to the bargaining table. The President is playing it like a Stradivarius violin right now.</p><p>QUEST: Sir, good to have you. There's a seat in this studio, waiting for you or --</p><p>NAVARRO: It's been too long, my friend.</p><p>QUEST: Or my threat, I'll end up coming to visit you.</p><p>NAVARRO: We will host you on the lawn and we'll have tea on the lawn here.</p><p>QUEST: Now, that's a promise. All right. Good to see you, Peter, as always. Thank you.</p><p>Donald Trump tweeted, it's a good day in the stock market. He tweeted it, he might have jinxed it. We were up 186. It was red at lunchtime and United Technologies of course, is up some 4 percent. A six-day winning streak on the line. Markets have been on a tear.</p><p>We shouldn't necessarily perhaps be too concerned, after all, there's action from the Fed, shrugging off a trade war, saber rattling from the White House.</p><p>Art Hogan is with me to put some perspective. We need perspective. Chief market strategist at national securities, I suppose we shouldn't be too alarmed that we're taking just a breather today.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES: Yes, I think when you look at this, Richard, we were down for seven weeks in a row. And we are now retracing 75 percent of that downdraft in six trading days.</p><p>QUEST: But that's not good.</p><p>HOGAN: That's not good. Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: Because rise like a rocket, fall like a rock.</p><p>HOGAN: Right? That's exactly correct.</p><p>QUEST: That's exactly what we're seeing here. So this volatility, in large part is caused because the pendulum swung too far when we sold off and the pendulum is probably swinging too far and retracing that move and getting -- clawing back some of that drawback because the narrative hasn't changed that much.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But what does the market now want? I mean, you heard this, you could only hear half of it. You had the discussion I was having with Peter Navarro. Tariffs is part of the U.S. trade policy now. Does not worry you?</p><p>HOGAN: It's bad economic policy and it worries me a lot. And it worries me even more that it doesn't sound like we're getting closer to the negotiating table. I think we're looking at the G-20 as that magic moment, when it's going to be the start of a beautiful friendship with President Xi and Trump again, and we're going to get something accomplished.</p><p>But it doesn't sound like this administration really wants to back down on this. I think they want to press harder and drag this out.</p><p>QUEST: But you can understand, I mean, to get the administration its fair due, on Mexico, it might be a different issue with immigration. But on the question of China, there are legitimate valid concerns about the way China has done international business.</p><p>HOGAN: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: And I suppose the argument will be whether the President is prepared to go to battle with all guns blazing, the rest of the world should be pleased.</p><p>HOGAN: The rest of world is very pleased. I would think that there might have been a better way to do this without tariffs. And perhaps we'd all get together as the rest of the world and put some pressure on China.</p><p>QUEST: You're an economist?</p><p>HOGAN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: What is so wrong with tariffs? When you hear somebody like Peter Navarro give a full throated robust defense as being a valid trade tool. As an economist, what do you say is wrong with it?</p><p>[15:15:05] HOGAN: Well, three things. First of all, inflation -- it causes inflation that has no economic benefit to it. So you're setting prices at an artificially high level for no good economic benefit.</p><p>The second thing is you strand capital. So we spent the last 20 years sending up complex supply chains around the globe, that's going to strand a lot of capital so you're wasting money.</p><p>The third is they generally don't work. Right? It's the inefficiency of supply and demand. And so in large part, it's generally used as a short term threat, but not an immigration policy. This is generally a short term threat when someone is actually dumping things into your market to get that to stop.</p><p>QUEST: Steel, tires --</p><p>HOGAN: Solar panels. Right. Exactly. And things like that. Commodity products that can get dumped that is sponsored by countries that are just trying to get a foothold and put your companies out of business.</p><p>That doesn't work in a long term planning basis. What does work is actually getting a consortium of countries together to say we should actually do a better job at working together on the international stage if you want to be part of that as a developed nation that would have been the way I would have attacked it.</p><p>QUEST: Do you see any shift in terms of -- you know, as a result of what the U.S. is doing now, do you think it's conceivable that tariffs will become part of the armory of most countries if and when they want to go to battle on trade?</p><p>HOGAN: Unfortunately, I think that's the case.</p><p>QUEST: In other words, is the U.S. normalizing the abnormal?</p><p>HOGAN: We're normalizing bad economic policy. And unfortunately, what happens is if you put a tariff on me, Richard, I have to retaliate somehow, I have to protect myself.</p><p>So the natural unintended consequences, I have to retaliate with some other measure and it's going to be a tariff on things that you buy.</p><p>And then you get to a point where if this goes for much longer, and we retaliate with all $300 billion of the imports that we don't have tariff on now, we're going to drive the economy into a recession.</p><p>QUEST: You're not seeing recession at the moment?</p><p>HOGAN: Not just yet.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you as always.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you so much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. After the break, Beyond Meat is taking a battering today. Investors are wondering if the firm's valuation is overcooked.</p><p>Also, one of the world's financial capitals faces major walkouts in the coming hours. It's in Hong Kong and the protests are growing.</p><p>It is quarter past three in the morning there, in just a few hours of course, we'll see the full results of those protests. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live in New York.</p><p>[15:20:01] QUEST: Big tech is now big politics in Washington. There are a series of hearings taking place on Capitol Hill with the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and they are grilling tech companies about competition in digital markets.</p><p>Lawmakers are getting into how platforms like Facebook have affected news content. There are questions to be asked about the spread of information online. The first here comes a day after the President suggested there's something going on in terms of big tech monopoly.</p><p>The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee opened the first thing with a warning. Jerry Nadler says big tech is a threat to free press.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Today as the internet becomes the dominant platform for accessing news, and as this platform grows more and more concentrated in the hands of just two major companies, the news media once again face serious threats and congressional action once again may be required.</p><p>As avenues for accessing news have narrowed in recent years, advertising revenue, which is the primary means of support for most news publishers has steadily declined as well, and as revenue is full and so too is the number of journalists whose work can't be supported by news publications.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: CNN's Brian Stelter is watching the first hearings. What do you make of them?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: This is the first of many hearings in the House looking at antitrust law as it relates to big tech. Clearly, there are a lot of Democratic lawmakers who want to challenge the technology companies, some Republicans as well.</p><p>And at the same time, you have the Trump administration amping up its pressure on the companies. So Google, Facebook, they're getting it from all directions.</p><p>But it's notable that today, this very first hearing, it is about journalism, about local journalism, and how it's been upended by Google and Facebook. Of course, print newspapers are already starting to fade in the United States before Facebook came along.</p><p>But Google and Facebook have sucked up so much ad revenue, the local papers feel they are a major threat. And now there's this interesting bill being introduced in the House and in the Senate, both bipartisan bills, suggesting an antitrust exemption for local publishers, so they can negotiate collectively with Google and with Facebook.</p><p>We will see what actually gets passed. But that's what they are talking about today on Capitol Hill.</p><p>QUEST: How much of what they're trying to do is holding back the tide? And I read your newsletter every day, and I read job losses in certain areas with three jobs created, 15 jobs lost.</p><p>STELTER: That's right. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: But what are you going to do? You're going to break up Google? You're going to break up Facebook? I mean, there is historical precedent - - Standard Oil, IBM, AT&amp;T.</p><p>STELTER: There's very little I think that newspaper publishers can do right now on their own to stem this tide. They say working collectively, maybe they can get a better deal with Google and Facebook. But this problem is much bigger than Google and Facebook. It's about a world that has gone from few to many where everybody is a publisher.</p><p>And so I think this hearing today, probably less consequential to the future of antitrust law than the other ones will be because Google and Facebook, Amazon and Apple, they're going to be under scrutiny for many months to come on Capitol Hill.</p><p>QUEST: But do you see this, particularly since the DOJ is involved, do you see this inexorably and inevitably ending up in some form of enforcement action?</p><p>STELTER: I'm skeptical. I think lawmakers are great at the bark and not as great as the bite. Certainly, Google, Facebook, other companies are hiring even more lobbyists to try to fend off regulation that they don't want to see happen. But you know how this works, Richard, they say they're welcome, they're open to new regulations. They're just not specific about which ones.</p><p>Clearly, these companies don't want to be broken up. They believe being broken up would hurt consumers at the end of the day and it's hard for me to foresee a world where we're going to see serious government action. Maybe I'm being too cynical about politicians, though. Maybe. Maybe.</p><p>QUEST: I find that hard to believe. Donald Trump is in Iowa. Joe Biden is in Iowa. From what you can tell from the early tone of a very early election. What's it like?</p><p>STELTER: That Trump needed someone to battle and he has chosen Biden as Biden is a front runner of the polls, so they're acting like it's a general election already today, going back and forth.</p><p>You know, Trump, attacking Biden, very personal terms. Biden, giving multiple speeches against Trump today. Interestingly, Biden calling out Trump's attacks on the Free Press, among other factors in his speeches.</p><p>You know, Trump is out there this week talking about the big tech companies, about antitrust saying something is going on. But that's typical Trump, but he's just talking, he doesn't seem to actually be taking action.</p><p>He takes this very personally. He looks at Google and Facebook, he complains about so-called censorship that doesn't really exist. And for him, it's all personal. No change there.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>STELTER: You too. Thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. Good to see you. Now, one of the top Democrats involved with these hearings on big tech has told CNN, it's all about keeping things competitive, and protecting the consumer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): It's really to look at the entire marketplace, these large technology platforms are very dominant, it is to look at the sort of monopoly moment that we're in and figure out how we get the market working right.</p><p>We want to be sure that they aren't engaging in anti-competitive behavior, that isn't harming consumers, harming our access to truthful reliable information that they're not excluding rivals. You know, competition matters in our economy.</p><p>[15:25:12] CICILLINE: It's how you generate innovation and entrepreneurship and protect consumers. And we've seen some consequences of this tremendous concentration of economic power in these large technology platforms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Tech companies may be falling out of favor on the Hill. But a new list shows they're still top in the eyes of the world's consumers.</p><p>Tech names dominate the 2019 list of most valuable global brands. They occupy the top 10 spots and the ranking by the research agency, Kantar. I mean, all the obvious ones.</p><p>Amazon takes the top spot for the first time, overtaking Apple and Google who have held it since 2007.</p><p>Doreen Wang is with me, Global Head of BrandZ at Kantar, the company behind the list. If we look at the list, tell me what surprises you about it.</p><p>DOREEN WANG, GLOBAL HEAD OF BRANDZ, KANTAR: When we look at the global top 100 most valuable brands, it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a massive 53 percent.</p><p>QUEST: But that's because they are tech companies and techs involve --</p><p>WANG: Not only tech companies and that there are many luxury brands. One of the top risers are like Chanel and Gucci all have recovery, and Lululemon and like Instagram, they are all top risers and not just limited to tech brands.</p><p>But it is among the top 10, what is surprising to us, it used to be all American brands. And right now there are eight American brands, and two Chinese brands and Alibaba and Tencent are being number seven and number eight, and Amazon is our number one that is surprising, but Amazon is meeting and exceeding customers these and making our lives much convenient.</p><p>QUEST: So this is not about size of company. This is perception of brand or how do you value brand?</p><p>WANG: What is brand equity? Brand equity really lives in the minds and hearts of the consumers. So we research and interviewed over four million consumers around the world and to see how meaningful and different these brands are connected with consumers and making their lives better.</p><p>QUEST: But isn't -- aren't some of them brands we use and love to hate. I'll give you a good -- you know what I mean? Amazon, you can have a conversation on the bus with friends and family and they'll say, I think I'm really worried about what's happening with Amazon and local corner shops and this that and the other. And by the way, I've just gone and bought all my detergent on it.</p><p>WANG: Yes. But we have to admit that Amazon is the best brand which makes our life much more convenient than before.</p><p>Amazon is not just e-commerce anymore. Amazon has Prime and Alexa and Amazon Go and wherever consumers are, and it is creating the new touchpoints.</p><p>QUEST: Interesting that Visa is there. And of course by the way, I do need to point out, AT&amp;T is there, parent company of this network. Why are they there?</p><p>WANG: Like Visa, for example is not a traditional payment credit card companies anymore. Visa has launched this innovation hub which has nurtured a lot of growth of the FinTech startup companies.</p><p>QUEST: If you pull the strands together and you look at the list. What does it tell you?</p><p>WANG: Well, it tells us that the boundaries -- the traditional category boundaries have been broken and the competition is increasing.</p><p>There are so many small and agile brands that are entering the top 100 and even the top 10. So how can we keep building and they'll maybe jointly building the ecosystem and those brands will win.</p><p>QUEST: Don't you find -- don't you slightly regret there's no manufacturing. There's no industrial -- there's no company that makes something. I suppose Apple arguably, but you know what I mean.</p><p>WANG: You know, we still have GE.</p><p>QUEST: Where?</p><p>WANG: It is among the top 30. It is not the top 10 anymore like 10 years ago, GE was at the top 10 and we have Haier, the home appliance brand, number one worldwide and yes, we have -- we still have manufacturer brands.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>WANG: Great seeing you.</p><p>QUEST: GE maybe your top 30, it's not even in the Dow top 30 anymore. So you're doing better than that. Good to see you.</p><p>WANG: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Shares of Beyond Meat are losing a bit of sizzle. Some investors are turning their noses up at the stock after an analyst downgrade. After the break, all about meat.</p><p>[15:30:00] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. And it's the end of an era for a New York power lunch as the Four Seasons Restaurant shuts its doors for good, and not a great day for fake meat burgers either. Beyond Meat is down more than 20 percent -- as you and I continue our evening chat, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Hong Kong is bracing for more mass protests over a controversial bill that would allow extraditions to China. Demonstrators are gathering ahead of a second debate in parliament. But their numbers could swell dramatically as daybreak arrives as a powerful trade union is calling for a strike on Wednesday.</p><p>President Trump says he's received a very personal and beautiful letter from Kim Jong-un. He praised North Korean leader for in his words, \"keeping his word\" on nuclear and missile testing, contradicting his own national security adviser who says Pyongyang is not complying with the deal reached in Singapore.</p><p>Crews have now lifted the wrecked tourist boat from the Danube River in Hungary. They found four more bodies, the number confirmed, that is 24, however, several people are still missing. The boat was carrying South Korean tourists when it collided with a larger vessel, it sank within moments last month.</p><p>Russia has dropped charges against a top investigative journalist and set him free due to lack of evidence. Ivan Golunov is best known for exposing corruption, he was detained on a drug charge he says was fabricated. His detention sparked outrage and an outpouring of support.</p><p>And consensual same-sex relations are no longer illegal in Botswana. The country's high court unanimously overturned a colonial era law that made gay sex a crime. Heterosexual relationships had been punishable by up to seven years in prison. A senior adviser to Donald Trump is defending his use of tariffs.</p><p>He says the president's deal with Mexico is proof tariffs work. Speaking exclusively to us earlier this hour, the president's senior policy adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S. will either get a great deal with Beijing or China will face the wrath of more Trump tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:35:00] PETER NAVARRO, SENIOR TRUMP POLICY ADVISER: We've given the Chinese many opportunities to negotiate in good faith, and we had a 150- page-plus agreement across seven verticals, including the forced technology transfer, the intellectual property theft, and they reneged on that at the end.</p><p>So, that's where we are. I don't want to say any more than that, other than to say that we've got the president of the United States, he is the best negotiator in the world, with a left-handed in Robert E. Lighthizer as the USTR, is the finest negotiator I've ever met in the trenches, basically working with the Chinese and we'll see what happens. And we'll either get a great deal or we'll get tariffs. Simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, simple.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: It seems that way if you're in the White House. You just keep threatening tariffs until you get what you want.</p><p>QUEST: What was interesting about what Peter Navarro says is that tariffs is regarded as a legitimate, not just economic tool, but in all circumstances.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think that obviously there are still some concerns about this game that the Trump administration is playing with China. Because as you know, Richard, obviously, many companies in the U.S. and throughout the world do want China to open up its market for fair trade, particularly with regards to technology.</p><p>So, anything that the Trump administration is doing to enforce patent protection, that would be something that I think most corporations would applaud. The problem as we saw with what happened with Mexico is that many American companies are getting very tired of just we're going to do tariffs as the knee-jerk reaction --</p><p>QUEST: But it worked! It worked! It's arguably worked with steel. It's arguably worked with China, and maybe not yet. It's arguably worked with Mexico.</p><p>LA MONICA: It arguably has worked, and the U.S. obviously had more leverage over Mexico which I think probably helped. But China is a formidable economic competitor, and obviously still, even though I doubt that China would pull the so-called kind of, you know, nuclear sort of response of dumping treasury debt, because that would hurt themselves as well, that is still a card that they have, that they could play.</p><p>So China, I think is someone that the Trump administration has to be more wary about than say Mexico or even the European Union. And of course, despite all the talk that the Trump administration loves to tout about how tariffs are a positive for the U.S. economy because it brings in more revenue, it's not that simple, because it hurts all of those U.S. corporations --</p><p>QUEST: Not according to --</p><p>LA MONICA: I know, that is --</p><p>QUEST: Peter, you heard him.</p><p>LA MONICA: I heard Peter Navarro and I've heard the president say this time and time again, that doesn't mean that they're right. Just saying something over and over again doesn't make it right.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk -- don't go away, because I want to talk about Beyond Meat. It's been in the savory day for Beyond Meat. The shares soured and JPMorgan downgrade. And if you look at the menu, shares down some 20 percent today -- I think, well, you have to have a cow mooing because you've got to have a plant growing, it's a bit silent.</p><p>So, even though it's Beyond Meat, it's in sympathy. JPMorgan was an underwriter with public offering, so the fact that it's now saying investment bank lower Beyond Meat to neutral is significant. The company is not yet profitable. And reported quarterly sales of a measly $40 million. When the market closed on Monday, the company was valued $10 billion, more like $8 billion, still sizable, Paul?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, first off, farm animals are obviously a much better sound effect than photosynthesis which it has been boring quite, but --</p><p>QUEST: You're right --</p><p>LA MONICA: That being said, I think that obviously right now, JPMorgan is recognizing what many on Wall Street are, which is that Beyond Meat is a definite leader in a category that's growing rapidly. But the valuation was absurd, insane, you know, pick your adjectives of choice, and JPMorgan is not souring on the company's business, it's just the valuation, and that is why the stock has come down.</p><p>QUEST: OK, but there's something wrong -- I mean, as far as you can't really say there's something wrong with the market, you know, the market is --</p><p>LA MONICA: There may be something wrong with the market.</p><p>QUEST: But you know, to go 23 percent or 70 percent and then drop back 24 percent, this is the definition of a bubble.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, this is a company that has been extremely headline-driven. Any time there's good news about Beyond Meat, the stock goes up. When there's good news about Beyond Meat's main rival, impossible, the stock goes up. Today, you have the negative news of one of the bankers, mind you, that's the other thing.</p><p>This isn't just some second-tier, third-tier Wall Street research firm. This is JPMorgan which was one of the company's that helped bring Beyond Meat public, and they're throwing up their hands and saying this is a little insane.</p><p>QUEST: How much of all of this is just a frolic of its own? It tells us nothing about the industry, it tells us nothing about food supply, it's just a -- I mean, 24 percent.</p><p>[15:40:00] LA MONICA: Yes, I think this tells us more about investor psychology --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: And tulips and bubbles and --</p><p>QUEST: Oh --</p><p>LA MONICA: What have you. Tulips, plant based, not going to eat them but they are plant-based.</p><p>QUEST: Tulip -- I was in Amsterdam and I was reading about tulip-mania. It was very interesting.</p><p>LA MONICA: And it's a very -- I mean, it's obviously the pre-eminent bubble that to this day we all talk about, yes, so.</p><p>QUEST: People get -- tulips were selling for the price of a house.</p><p>LA MONICA: It was pretty crazy.</p><p>QUEST: So maybe your burger will sell for the price of your car. Good to see you. Still ahead, protesters in Hong Kong say they are fighting for the identity of a city as they know it. A fueling day of protests that we need to understand, after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Hong Kong is in the grip of what could be its biggest protest movement since 1997 hand back. One of the city's biggest trade unions is now calling for a strike in the coming hours. Earlier, there were more rallies over a bill that would allow the extradition of fugitives to mainland China. The critics fear this bill however well intentioned could be widely abused.</p><p>The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions says \"this government wants us to be frustrated and defeated by it, but we are not. On the contrary, we want to let the Chief Executive Carrie Lam know the protest on June the 9th is only the beginning of this fight.\"</p><p>Hong Kong is a city built for business, and mass strikes could hit hard. Jamie Metzl is the Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of a new book \"Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity\". Always good to have you, sir --</p><p>JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL &amp; AUTHOR: Nice to see you again --</p><p>QUEST: Always good -- OK, how serious is this latest battle in Hong Kong?</p><p>METZL: It's a big deal because Hong Kong was promised at the time of the handover to China that it was going to have one country, two systems. China is completely reneging on that deal, and every time the people who are supporting more independence for Hong Kong, more -- the maintenance of this system, this legal system that has defended people's rights, they're getting pushed back. And this extradition -- and this extradition law is a big and a fundamental blow to the concept --</p><p>QUEST: But there's nobody --</p><p>METZL: Of Hong Kong.</p><p>QUEST: It is only a negative if it is abused by the Chinese.</p><p>METZL: Yes, well, that -- think of what you're saying --</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST: Well, I know, I know, but I know --</p><p>METZL: Of course the Chinese are going to be --</p><p>QUEST: I mean, on the basis of these two sides to have the argument, the Hong Kong government says look, at the moment, we can't extradite a Taiwan murderer to Taiwan because there's no extradition treaty.</p><p>METZL: Yes, they don't have an extradition treaty with China, but they have extradition treaties with others who they think are responsible actors. And as a matter of fact, the protection against the Chinese legal system is built into the Hong Kong law because people recognize that China doesn't have the rule of law. And so if there aren't these kinds of protections, everybody knows that China is going to abuse that to limit the freedom of maneuver inside of Hong Kong.</p><p>QUEST: The difficulty here is, regardless of the protests -- and maybe I'm just being cynical here that the law is going to be passed.</p><p>METZL: It is.</p><p>QUEST: There's a majority on LegCo --</p><p>METZL: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: For Beijing, a pro-Beijing majority in-built -- the chief executive was appointed by Beijing --</p><p>METZL: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: In some sham election.</p><p>METZL: It's true, so Beijing holds the cards in Hong Kong and it's really tragic, because we are watching Hong Kong and this idea of Hong Kong, and not just the idea that was from the British or from the NGOs, but what China promised Hong Kong, and that space is being limited --</p><p>QUEST: It should be --</p><p>METZL: And it's very worrying.</p><p>QUEST: Did anybody really ever think that the Chinese were going to keep their word on that? I mean --</p><p>METZL: Yes, I mean, let's put it this way. One, people did, and I think it's right for people in Hong Kong to hold China to its word. And the second thing is that if you're in Taiwan, you're looking at Hong Kong and China is promising you one country, two systems for Hong Kong, you'd be insane to think that's a serious offer.</p><p>QUEST: So, 50 years takes us to 2047.</p><p>METZL: Correct --</p><p>QUEST: We're just -- we're not quite at the halfway point. But I was in Hong Kong recently, and there the business talk is what's after '47. It seems a long way away, but if you're about to take a lease on an office building, a 20-storey office building, it could be a 30-year lease.</p><p>METZL: It could be --</p><p>QUEST: So --</p><p>METZL: And China has a plan of integrating that whole Pearl River Delta, and Hong Kong will be -- will be part of it. But if you're someone who lives in Hong Kong and you believe that the rule of law means something to you, then you should be worried.</p><p>QUEST: But does it mean that China, before long, is going to have to make a statement of intent about -- not rather a traditional treaty, but about the post 50-year policy that they will maintain for China? Because very soon and sir, within 20 years, people are going to say what's next?</p><p>METZL: Yes, well, China is making that statement now. It's very clear that the system of special rights for Hong Kong, a system of rule of law has been limited. And that's where things are heading.</p><p>QUEST: This all seems very strange, when I look, you're the genetic engineering in the future of humanity. Does it seem weird to write a book like this when we're all still arguing about, you know, systems of government in 40 years time. When you're talking about something far more serious in --</p><p>METZL: Well, it's connected.</p><p>QUEST: Is it, how?</p><p>METZL: And it is because they're going to be the story of the 21st century, is the competitive ecosystems between China and the United States, and the technologies of the future, the technology of the 21st century like AI, ergonomics are going to be part of this competition. It's part and parcel of everything.</p><p>QUEST: Does it hurt or harm, maybe I'm being too narrow-minded and parochial, does it harm or hurt or harm when you have these -- the United States go on this tariff war, this -- against somebody like China?</p><p>METZL: Well, the United States has to stand up to China. China has since it entered the WTO, has abused the privilege that it was given. And so the United States and the European Union for that matter need to tow a much tougher line on China. But if the United States is being tough on China, the best way to do it would have been to bring everybody together through an entity like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p>But even then, even now, the U.S. has to push hard on China because China has abused the system.</p><p>QUEST: Trans-Pacific Partnership, haven't heard that one for a while.</p><p>METZL: You know, we're still holding on to hope.</p><p>QUEST: T -- what are we?</p><p>METZL: TPP --</p><p>QUEST: Right though, but it's -- they've --</p><p>METZL: Well, now it's without the United States, and --</p><p>QUEST: It's T-12 minus one or whatever it is --</p><p>METZL: Right, and Japan is carrying the flag and some day, the U.S. will recognize that the best strategy for us is with our allies.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you --</p><p>METZL: My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: Last call at the Four Seasons Restaurant. The venerable institution closes its doors of a proper farewell toast after the break.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The music, the Four Seasons Restaurant, the legendary dining room of New York's elite has shut its doors. For 40 years, it created the power lunch, and rose from executives to statesman, moguls to movie stars. Deals were closed over some of the most expensive meals in the city. And you always had your own table, the right table.</p><p>You didn't want to be sitting too near the pool. You were rubbing elbows with coked-in insider ambiance. Now, the storied original dress in its Picasso curtain closed in 2016, it moved only blocks away where it reopened only last year. It was about a $30 million or $40 million renovation. And there it will close.</p><p>This isn't a mere shuttering of the business, it's the end of an era. So please, join me pool side, won't you, Steve Zagor is with me, the former dean of the institute, good to see you, sir -- good Lord --</p><p>STEPHEN ZAGOR, FORMER DEAN, INSTITUTE OF CULINARY EDUCATION: There goes where --</p><p>QUEST: You can't take me anywhere. It's -- now, why did the Four Seasons -- it was an institution.</p><p>ZAGOR: It was an institution.</p><p>QUEST: What went wrong?</p><p>ZAGOR: It just -- it outlived its usefulness. At this point, it had become a little bit of a dinosaur in a world that had changed around it. And the field was different, the people are changing, the whole texture of New York is changing, and it just was a relic.</p><p>QUEST: But I went to the Four Seasons several times. And you could only have certain tables, because other tables were always taken by the same, it'd be Les Moonves reserve over there, there will -- names themselves as MP, Rupert would have his table over there, people would have their tables and they'd have them there every day.</p><p>ZAGOR: Every single day, and that became part of a notoriety, but those people don't come around so much anymore. And it split a little bit because remember the Four Seasons that you said moved. And so they had --</p><p>QUEST: That was a disaster.</p><p>ZAGOR: That was part of the end. They lost that historic moment that was in the old location. It had been there for so many years, with all the great art and the great -- and the great pool room and all the stuff that you just --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>ZAGOR: Mentioned.</p><p>QUEST: Just look at it.</p><p>ZAGOR: I know, I know, I feel like I want to dive in.</p><p>QUEST: The food, it was good, but I wouldn't have said it was --</p><p>ZAGOR: No --</p><p>QUEST: It wasn't something to die for.</p><p>ZAGOR: No, it was -- it wasn't the food, it was the entire experience. It was as you said, it was the regularity, it was being loved --</p><p>QUEST: They drove the soul --</p><p>ZAGOR: They drove the soul, exactly right --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, they drove a soul --</p><p>ZAGOR: If you're thinking soul, there's soul --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>ZAGOR: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: So how much of the scandal of one of the owners who was kicked roundly out and nearly prosecuted over sexual offenses, how much did that tarnish it?</p><p>ZAGOR: I think it created a real black mark. And there are people who will never go back there because of that. It just is not politically correct for them to do that. So, it didn't help. You've got an aging business with black marks on it, it had a really difficult time.</p><p>[15:55:00] QUEST: And they dare to spend on the new. It was, you know, arguably. So --</p><p>ZAGOR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Tell me, where are people going now?</p><p>ZAGOR: They're going all over. New York has changed. I mean, all of -- a lot of the businesses --</p><p>QUEST: We're not having candle amber and lights, where are we going now?</p><p>ZAGOR: I think that sort of light is out on the Four Seasons --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: It absolutely does it. So I will go somewhere trendy, I want to go somewhere in and somewhere powerful, somewhere Uber good.</p><p>ZAGOR: We're going to neighborhood places around where you are. We're going to your Omakase. We're going to your favorite restaurant that might be downtown in the financial district, where all of the other powerful people go. You may be over here in Hudson Yards, it's disbursed. It's a little less formal, a little less centric, it's just changed.</p><p>QUEST: So the Four Seasons is gone. The rainbow -- the Russian tearooms are sort of --</p><p>ZAGOR: Oh, my gosh, not so much --</p><p>QUEST: No --</p><p>ZAGOR: Twenty One a little bit is still going on --</p><p>QUEST: Twenty One, the burger?</p><p>ZAGOR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The most expensive burger in the city history --</p><p>ZAGOR: In humanity, nope, but it's big up there, absolutely, but the 21 is definitely a power place, no question about it.</p><p>QUEST: Where would you -- where should I take you for lunch next?</p><p>ZAGOR: Sweet Greens?</p><p>QUEST: Sweet Greens, downstairs, excellent!</p><p>ZAGOR: You've got it.</p><p>QUEST: Right, we will have our profitable moment after the break. More champagne?</p><p>ZAGOR: Oh, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, you have to admire Peter Navarro. On this program tonight, a full-throated robust defense of tariffs, both as a defensive weapon and as also an angle of attack. It's something that is so verboten, something so forbidden in many other economists' language, and Navarro and this administration goes for it.</p><p>You don't have to like it, but you can admire the thoroughness and at least the difference in which they put it forward. He was honest, he was forthright. Most don't agree with him, but that is the policy of the United States. Tariffs are part of the arsenal of weapons used in trade.</p><p>And it will continue with China and beyond. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. I am off to Singapore and Sydney. If you see me on the travels, do stop and say hello. The bell is ringing --</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The day is done! The Dow is down!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-Y6H1-JB20-G0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Four Seasons Restaurant</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beyond Meat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>International Emergency Economic Powers Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZCQjQ5MjIzN0E4NDMzMUE5NzVFOEY4MTNEMUVEM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

Counting down to the closing bell on the final day of the third  quarter on Wall Street.  The Dow is lower.  This is STREETSWEEP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A medication used to relieve pain for millions of people is now a source of  pain for the company that makes it.  Merck [Company: Merck &amp; Co. Inc.;   Ticker: MRK ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.merck.com\">http://www.merck.com</url>/] is pulling its arthritis drug  Vioxx effective immediately.  And investors are pulling out of Merck.  That  stock is down 27 percent.  That`s roughly $27 billion of lost market cap.   The stock now at the lowest price in eight years.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fred Katayama was at a Merck press conference earlier this morning.  He  joins us now with the details.  Fred?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Christine, the more than a  million arthritis patients in the U.S. now taking Vioxx will soon have to  stop taking it.  It`s manufacturer Merck is pulling Vioxx off the world- wide market.  The company made the decision after clinical tests results  showed the drug raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RAYMOND GILMARTIN, CEO, MERCK:  Importantly, in the first 18 months of the  study, there is no difference in the risk for heart attack or stroke in  patients taking either Vioxx or placebo.  Beginning after 18 months,  however, the risk of a cardiovascular event did increase among those on  Vioxx.  Accordingly, we are voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx effective today. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KATAYAMA:  The bombshell announcement came just weeks after Merck had  insisted Vioxx was safe.  An FDA study had showed that patients taking high  doses of Vioxx had a three-times greater chance of a heart attack than  those not taking painkillers.  But today the Food and Drug Administration  said Merck did the right thing in reporting its findings.  And it said it  would closely monitor other arthritis drugs for similar side effects. </p><p>But Merck`s investors got burned.  Shares of the drug company sank to their  lowest levels in nearly a decade.  The Vioxx withdrawal will cut into  Merck`s profits this year.  It`s $2.5 billion in revenues make up more than  a tenth of the company`s sales.  For now, patients on Vioxx can switch to  other arthritis drugs like Celebrex. </p><p>Merck says it`s clinical results do not necessarily apply to other drugs in  it`s class.  But some analysts say Merck`s findings might make patients  more cautious about taking other arthritis drugs. </p><p>ROMANS:  OK.  Let`s talk about the company.  Let`s talk about the  executives of the company.  Ray Gilmartin, the CEO at that press conference  this morning.  Even before this happened, there had been people on the  street who have been saying the performance of the company was sub par and  maybe he should resign.  What do you say? </p><p>KATAYAMA:  Well, the reporters did ask him at the press conference if he  was going to step down.  He said no.  </p><p>ROMANS:  What are the analysts saying about how well he`s handling this  crisis? </p><p>KATAYAMA:  Some people say it was good that he stepped up and voluntarily  pushed forward instead of waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to  mandate a withdrawal.  So in a sense, the positive spin on this story is  that Pfizer [Company: Pfizer Inc.; Ticker:  PFE; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pfizer.com\">http://www.pfizer.com</url>/] took an active role in trying to  -- you know, what  people call  a proactive role in trying to withdraw the drugs from the  market before it created any harm. </p><p>But as you know, he`s been under a lot of pressure.  He said he`s not going  to resign. </p><p>ROMANS:  This has been a heavily advertised drug.  A lot of people now --  what are people supposed to do who are on the drug?  And I can`t imagine  how this is going to change the entire landscape for arthritis medications.   And for the other companies that make these medications.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  The people who are currently on the drug, they are advised to  stop taking it.  Right now Pfizer is working with the medical profession to  try to get those drugs off the shelves and to get patients worldwide to  stop taking this drug.  Now there are other options for those patients.   That`s the good news. </p><p>For example, they can turn to Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer.  And there  are other arthritis drugs on the market.  And drug analysts feel that the  company that will benefit the most out of this is Pfizer, because Celebrex  is currently the best-selling arthritis drug on the market.  Another  beneficiary Chris, according to analyst in Merrill Lynch could be Schering- Plough.</p><p>ROMANS:  Oh really?</p><p>KATAYAMA:  And the reason is because now that Merck is really under  pressure, remember, Merck has had a weak pipeline for several years. </p><p>ROMANS:  Sure.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  The analyst community has said Merck you have to combine with  some other company the way that Pfizer bought out Warner-Lambert.  We saw  consolidation in the sector.  Merck said, no we`re going to go it alone.   Well, the Merrill analyst thinks that is going to pressure Merck to perhaps  swallow another company, possibly Schering-Plough.  You know, you got to  fill that pipeline.</p><p>ROMANS:  Absolutely.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  Especially with the $2.5 billion in revenues taken out with this  Vioxx drug. </p><p>ROMANS:  A very big story.  And I am sure we are not going to hear the last  of it.  All right.  Thanks, Fred Katayama.   </p><p>Merck`s top competitor in the arthritis medication field as Fred said,  Pfizer.  And it`s shares are higher today.  Shares of Pfizer, which makes  Celebrex up more than 1 percent. </p><p>Later in the program in our five for five segment, I`ll speak with a money  manager who says Pfizer is a good pick for your portfolio over the next  five years. </p><p>Merck`s loss today accounts for the entire drop in the Dow Industrials.   Without it, the market would actually be up.  Rhonda Schaffler live at the  New York Stock Exchange.  Rhonda?</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  Hi Christine.  </p><p>Well, as you can imagine, this story really has taken stage on Wall Street.   And not only is the broader market OK.  Advancers are actually leading  decliners by a 3/2 margin.  We have a situation here where Merck is going  to impact the numbers for the quarter for the Dow with this very dramatic  close that we are expecting here. </p><p>Obviously, it will be difficult for any sort of recovery late in the day.   NASDAQ, though, is in a lot better shape when we look at the chart.  Again  because remember, there is underlying strength in the market today.  You  are just not seeing it with the Dow because of Merck, which is dominating  the action here.  Merck, in fact, is the most actively traded stock at the  New York Stock Exchange today.  Down about 26 percent. </p><p>This will also be one of these days where this action will go in the record  books.  Because at this point, the trading in Merck is on tap to have one  of the top 10 one-day volumes in a single stock.  So this has been a very  huge story here.  You are looking at how some of the other drug stocks are  faring.  Obviously we`ve touch on Pfizer and Celebrex, which would benefit  from this news from Merck.</p><p>There are other big stories too.  Fannie Mae [Company: Fannie Mae ; Ticker:  FNM ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fanniemae.com\">http://www.fanniemae.com</url>/]  for instance.  This one has been a  big story it seems every day.  That stock is off again as the Justice  Department has opened an investigation into possible accounting fraud at  that company.  This comes after Fannie Mae`s government regulators said  last week the company may have manipulated it`s books.  The agency also now  will issue monthly reports regarding the company`s capital.  Used to send  out those reports quarterly. </p><p>Also on the earnings front, Fresh Del Monte [Company: Fresh Del Monte  Produce Inc.; Ticker: FDP; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.freshdelmonte.com\">http://www.freshdelmonte.com</url>/] produce cut  its earnings forecast for the full year by some 50 cents a share.  Del  Monte now sees 2004 earnings of $2.05 to $2.15 a share.  It cites lower  banana prices, less profitable shares of domestic melons, go figure.  And  hurricane-ravaged Florida tomatoes.  All those reasons sending the stock  sharply lower. </p><p>And now let`s look at Gateway [Company: Gateway Inc.; Ticker:  GTW; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gateway.com\">http://www.gateway.com</url>/].  A little bit of a different picture here.   Gateway is unveiling a new line of desktop PCs. Customers will be able to  customize their new models.  Gateway also says the higher end models will  have a different technology than previous systems.  Earlier this month  Gateway said it was going to shift its focus back to PCs. Wall Street  applauding that particular piece of news.  Christine? </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Rhonda Schaffler, thanks very much Rhonda, on as you  said, a very big news day. </p><p>That stunning Merck decline comes on the final day of a rough quarter for a  lot of stock investors.  Susan Green of IDI joins me now from the New York  Stock Exchange.  First, you heard Rhonda say this could be one of the top  10 trading days of any individual stock in Merck.  A huge move.  Susan,  give us a little bit of a sense how unusual it is to see a Dow component  lose a quarter of its value in one day. </p><p>SUSAN GREEN, IDI:  It`s actually very unusual.  Something we haven`t seen  in quite a while.  If you take the 87 or 88 million shares out of the Dow  today we`re still looking at roughly 1.35 billion shares today, which is  pretty interesting.  But to see a company lose almost 30 percent of its  market value is extraordinary.  It doesn`t happen very often. </p><p>And I think on the point of positive to positivity here, if you look at the  way the stock opened, it opened and traded within a point-and-a-quarter all  day long.  So that 88 million shares has basically been range bound on the  opening and thereafter, which is very unusual. </p><p>ROMANS:  Talk to us a little bit about this coming on the last day of a  quarter.  I mean, you have got a lot of mutual funds that own this.   \"Morningstar\" was telling us that Magellan .  For those of you out there  who own Magellan the mutual fund, or Vanguard, you are looking at you know  a concentration of this particular stock in your portfolio.  It`s the last  day of the quarter.  So it`s tough to sort of get out of a position, isn`t  it? </p><p>GREEN:  Well, it would be tough to get out of the position if there was no  volume.  That could be the reason for the stock opening at a range, staying  there all day long, and trading the size that it`s trading today.  They  took us at a level to get it to trade.  End of the quarter, people want  out.  New money going in.  There`s a rotation going on in the stock.  It  needs to happen today.  This is important. </p><p>They`ve managed to get it done.  Then you also have to think about the fact  that the Dow should probably be up on the day because of Merck being in the  component, and just the way we`re seeing the market now.  The money flow is  directly into the market at the end of the quarter, which is actually  pretty positive. </p><p>ROMANS:  That`s a really good way to look at it, stripping out Merck.   Merck right now is accounting for some 80, almost 90 points of Dow.  The  downside if you took it out, you`d actually have the Dow up a little bit. </p><p>OK.  Another little factoid I wanted to give you.  The Nasdaq on track for  its worst quarter, even if it closed higher today, on track for its worst  quarter in two years.  It was a tough quarter for tech stocks.  Do you feel  as though there could be some momentum in the other direction for the  fourth quarter? </p><p>GREEN:  Well, they actually tried doing it.  I mean, they got the  semiconductor index, the stocks down to a level where it started trading  based on the trading range.  So technically, it feels as if tech stocks are  actually bottomed out. But it wasn`t enough.  There`s not enough momentum  going into these stocks for the end of the quarter to get us going.</p><p>As we know, tech, and Nasdaq is generally tech driven, is basically forward  looking.  So what we need to see, management start coming out with earnings  within the next two weeks is what the guidance is going to be.  That`s what  the focus is going to be on.  That`s the only thing that`s going to get us  through to the fourth quarter. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Susan Green on the final day of a quarter.  Thanks for  stopping by Susan. </p><p>GREEN:  Thanks Christine.</p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up next on STREETSWEEP, more evidence the consumer is  cutting back.  At the same time jobless claims jump to the highest level in  seven months.  Kathleen Hays will be there to give us that.</p><p>Also, they are setting the stage for tonight`s first presidential debate,  but do we already know the winner in November?  Some say the economy is  giving us some pretty strong clues as to who will win the White House. </p><p>And what are the five best stocks for the next five years?  Today`s stock  picker says stick with the big names.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ROMANS:  More evidence the consumer may be holding back.  At the same the  unemployment line, the longest in seven months and the government blames  hurricanes.  Kathleen Hays is here to take a look. </p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we know hurricanes  don`t help much when people are trying to get to work, when there`s power  lines down, when the water is not running.  Of course there could be some  more people filing for unemployment benefits.  But let me give you the  numbers.  And you see that all hurricanes are not.  Jobless claims jumped  by 18,000 to 369,000.  That`s the highest level since about mid-February.</p><p>And, of course, it is fair to say, look, yes, we`ve had three weeks in a  row now of claims moving higher.  But we have also had these storms.  That  has to skew the numbers.  Bottom line is that four-week moving average,  actually this number overall is really kind of stuck in a range.  If you  just take this trend, it`s around 340,000, it isn`t going up, and it isn`t  going down.  It seems like the movement towards a healthier labor market,  if you look just at claims, has stalled.</p><p>But it`s stalled at a decent level.  Another thing to add in here though is  the help wanted index from the conference board, which measures column  inches of help wanted ads across the country, unchanged again in August.   The same level as last year.  And Ken Goldstein over at the conference  board says that this stagnant labor market is eating into consumer  confidence.  That`s something we saw earlier this week. </p><p>Speaking of the consumer, consumer spending out today.  This is the broad  measure of consumer spending, not just retail sales.  Not just spending on  items, on goods.  This includes spending on airline tickets, doctors  office, and education.  A very broad measure.  That number was flat.   That`s not such a good number.  Now of course, we did have two previous  months of gains, maybe a lull isn`t surprising. </p><p>We do have wage growth boosting income.  That`s the raw material for future  spending.  Maybe we`ll have a pickup.  That is the big question now.  One  thing I can tell you is inflation is looking very flame in this report as  it has in others.  It looks like companies still don`t have pricing power.   Christine.  Because a (INAUDIBLE), if the price is too high, we say no  thanks.  I don`t want to buy it.</p><p>ROMANS:  Right.  Absolutely.  Ok, now the economy not the first focus of  the first presidential debate. </p><p>HAYS:  How could they not?  How could they go past the economy? </p><p>ROMANS:  They`ll get to it.  They`ll get to it.  </p><p>HAYS:  The third debate.  Tonight of course, it`s foreign policy and  homeland security.  But it`s still about money, isn`t it?  Worried about  the budget deficit.  We`re worried about the dollar cost and things.  So we  just wanted to give you some facts on the figures. </p><p>In the 2005 fiscal year budget, national security, think of the Pentagon,  think of troops, think of new planes, all kind of things, that`s $420  billion.  The war next year, or this fiscal year I should say is going to  cost us $50 billion, at least.  Homeland security comes in at $32 billion  for a total of $500 billion.  And that is about one-fifth, isn`t it, of the  total budget of $2.4 trillion.  So that does put it in perspective.  It  also shows really, how important this is.</p><p>Everybody would say whatever it costs.  Whatever it costs for homeland  security.  Whatever it costs to be strong in the world.  It is a cost  though.  And spending that money of course takes money away from other  things.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Jobs also a big on the campaign trail.  October 8th is the last  jobs report before the election. </p><p>HAYS:  Isn`t that interesting?  Yes.  So this is the last one we`ll get to  see.  And then I think we get one more GDP report as well.  And it will be  the first look at third quarter GDP.  I think we also get that before-</p><p>ROMANS:  Very important.</p><p>HAYS:  It will be very important. </p><p>ROMANS:  It`s interesting.  Because depending on which camp you talk to.   You talk to the Kerry camp and they`ll say things like 3.9 million  Americans have simply exhausted their unemployment benefits over the last  year.  So when you talk about unemployment rates, you talk about people  getting jobs, keep in mind, there are almost 4 million people who simply  ran out of unemployment benefits and can`t find jobs.  </p><p>But the Bush administration will say look, the momentum has been good over  the past year.  So it`s so political -- </p><p>HAYS:  And we don`t know for sure.  I will say though, I think what`s  interesting when Dick Cheney says don`t worry, lots of those people are  selling things on eBay [Company: eBay Inc.; Ticker:  EBAY ; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ebay.com\">http://www.ebay.com</url>/] .  I would say, Mr. Cheney though, is that a sign of  health that people are making a living by selling stuff on eBay, or a sign  that they don`t have anything else to do?  Kind of arguing to the Kerry  point.  But it`s -- </p><p>ROMANS:  It`s certainly not the best job market in 20 years.  It`s not the  worst job market in three generations.</p><p>HAYS:  That`s right.</p><p>ROMANS:  Somewhere in the middle.  All right.  Thank you very much  Kathleen.</p><p>Still ahead on STREETSWEEP, fresh questions about Fannie Mae`s accounting  drag its shares to the lowest level in a year.  And the next step may be a  criminal case.</p><p>Also, Merck gets high marks for the way it`s handling the Vioxx crisis.   Can the company recover? </p><p>With a few minutes left until the closing bell, stocks are down.  The Dow  down 59 points, 10,076.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ROMANS:  Violence took a heavy toll in Iraq and in the Middle East.  In  Iraq, multiple car bombs rocked the capital killing 44 people, most of them  children.  That makes September the worst month for car bombs to date.   More casualties came from a U.S. air strike in Fallujah, and violence near  Mosul. </p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that violence is escalating,  and said he expects it to get even worse as Iraqi elections approach.  One  Iraqi official says the county`s security forces are preparing a major  offensive against the insurgents. </p><p>A bloody day in Gaza as well, where Israeli soldiers tried to halt a series  of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants.  In one marketplace, civilians  were caught in the crossfire.  A senior commander for Hamas said Israeli  troops must retreat from the battle sites if they want the rocket attacks  to stop. </p><p>And residents of Washington State are keeping a wary eye on the Cascades.   The area around Mount St. Helens is under a volcano advisory.  Geologists  say the volcano could erupt in coming days or weeks.  Officials say the  damage could be minimal or moderate, but note that seismic activity has  been rising steadily.</p><p>Back in the markets now.  For the third time this week, one of our five for  five stock pickers is recommending Pfizer as a stock for the long term.  Richard Steinberg says investors should focus on mega large cap stocks.  He  also has four other picks to share with u this afternoon.  We`re looking  for five great stocks for the next five years.  He joins me now from  (INAUDIBLE) Florida.</p><p>Welcome to the program. </p><p>RICHARD STEINBERG, STEINBERG GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey Christine, good  to see you again. </p><p>ROMANS:  Let`s talk first about Pfizer.  Because what better day for you to  come and say you think investors for the long-term should be buying Pfizer.   It`s up today.  A lot of people are talking about it and its drug Celebrex,  because of what`s happening with Vioxx and Merck. </p><p>STEINBERG:  Right.  Do I have blood here?  Because we also own a lot of  Merck.  I had an anvil fall on my head today. </p><p>ROMANS:  Oh man.  What are you going to do -- first of all, what are going  to do with your Merck shares?  Are you going to get out, or are you going  to buy more here?  Because it`s pretty cheap.  </p><p>STEINBERG:  We were on the conference call.  And if you remember, about a  year or so ago, you and I had Ray Gilmartin on your show. </p><p>ROMANS:  That`s right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I think for now we`re going to sit tight and let things settle  in.  And look to just kind of analyze things as they go on.  And not panic  out of the name.  But Pfizer still has a great franchise.  They`re going to  earn over $2.36 next year.  We`re looking for companies that are either  number one or number two market share in their markets now.  </p><p>They were number one or two.  And Celebrex, now there`s only one left  really.  So I think that that $2.36 could be light.  And it could be a lot  higher.  And I think the pipeline still is very strong for Pfizer.  It`s  trading at 13 multiple.  Good yield.  I think that`s also a trend we have  to look for, is getting paid to wait. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Let`s talk about General Electric [Company:  General  Electric Company;  Ticker: GE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ge.com\">http://www.ge.com</url>/] ; It`s also on your  list.  It`s another name that someone mentioned earlier this week too.  So  this is a big mega cap name.  It`s got exposure to a whole bunch of  different businesses, from jet engines, to the media.  Why do you like it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, if we get back to our five-year theme of having globally  diversified businesses, GE is a basically a bet that the long-term global  economy continues to grow.  They`re going to earn $1.78 this year.  The  six-sigma approach of getting out of businesses that they shouldn`t be in  continues to work well.  </p><p>Jeffrey Immelt`s doing an excellent job of kind of reining things in.  The  yield`s 2-plus percent.  And I think it`s a name that over a long-term  gives you broad exposure.  And a name that of you have a long enough time  horizon, like five years, you should own. </p><p>ROMANS:  This is a name that also gives you a broad global exposure as  well.  I mean, I know this is a big player in the global outsourcing  business. </p><p>STEINBERG:  IBM, absolutely.  They`ll going to earn $5.50 next year.   Stocks relatively cheap.  Cap ex spending and -- </p><p>ROMANS:  You`re talking about IBM [Company:  International Business  Machines Corporation; Ticker:  IBM; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibm.com\">http://www.ibm.com</url>/] here or GE? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, I`m sorry, GE, I`m sorry.  GE global outsourcing is still a  big deal.  But I think it`s more about getting some of the problems out of  the way that they have, where they`ve had with power generation and  aircrafts. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  You mentioned IBM.  Another big tech name.  Another  very well known blue chip name.  In the papers in the news today because of  a settlement, a payment, because of the way it sort of switched over some  of its retirees pensions.  Are you concerned about it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  I`m not concerned about the retirees.  There`s always kind of  complaining when things get changed a bit.  But the long-term story with  IBM is really more about the -- their ability to have a smoother revenue  stream than most tech companies, because of the recurring revenues from  consulting and services. </p><p>Citigroup [Company: Citigroup Inc.;  Ticker: C;  URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.citi.com\">http://www.citi.com</url>/]  .  Sally Krawcheck.  What do you think about that move?  Some changes over  at Citi lately.  Are you interested in Citigroup because of the way this  management is positioned?  Are you interested in it because it`s the  biggest player out there?  Why do you like it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Global reach in financial services, 10 times earnings, great  yield.  Obviously, with the change in interest rates that are occurring, I  believe that their balance sheet liability exposure is well positioned for  a bump up in rates.  And again, if I look out five years, and I want global  exposure, two names, I think Citigroup has to be a core holding. </p><p>ROMANS:  Target [Company:  Target Corporation;  Ticker: TGT;  URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.targetcorp.com\">http://www.targetcorp.com</url>/] is a number two to Wal-Mart [Company: Wal-Mart  Stores Inc.; Ticker: WMT ; URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wal-mart.com\">http://www.wal-mart.com</url>/] .  You know, Wal- Mart seems to gobble up everything every place it goes.  It`s the biggest  retailer.  The biggest everything.  How can Target position itself with  Wal-Mart sort of as the big you know, gorilla in the field? </p><p>STEINBERG:  I think this is the PT boat outmaneuvering the large aircraft  carrier right now.  Target is going to earn $2.60 this year.  They`ve shed  Marshall Fields , which was kind of the albatross.  And I think that as we  go through kind of these pitfalls and ups and downs in the economy, the  market will continue to drive towards that discount retailing. </p><p>Wal-Mart is still the 800-pound gorilla, but doesn`t mean the baby gorilla  can`t make money along the way.  I think in the short run, especially with  some of the problems that they have in litigation, and litigation payments  that Wal-Mart has, that they`re going to be able to make a lot of money. </p><p>ROMANS:  Overall Richard, tell us a little bit about what kinds of criteria  you use for picking stocks.  Talk to our viewer, the average investor who  is looking out for five years trying to build some sort of portfolio. </p><p>STEINBERG:  So the first thing that you need to do is you need to know what  you own.  The second thing is, I think if you focus on large, easy to  understand companies, you have a much better ability to have successful  performance and not get caught up in the latest technological changes. </p><p>The other thing is you want to focus on companies that can dominate their  market share, that have a diversified business model, and have very strong  management.  You have to be able to distinguish the difference between  owning a good company, and owning a good stock. </p><p>If you can bring those pieces together and focus on also getting paid to  wait with some dividends where possible, I think, as we go through a  transition in the economy over the next five years, we`ll, -- you`ll be  successful. </p><p>ROMANS:  Richard Steinberg thanks so much for joining us.  We`re going to  put those stock picks on our web site if anybody missed them.</p><p>Still ahead, President George Bush and Senator John Kerry square off  tonight in the first presidential debate.  Their subject -- foreign policy. </p><p>Plus, a long-term look at Merck.  Vioxx is one problem.  But here`s  another.  Its patent for top-selling Zocor expires in about a year. </p><p>Moments to go to the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average down 71  points.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR USE OUR  SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://WWW.FDCH.COM\">WWW.FDCH.COM</url></p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2004 Cable News Network, Inc.

Counting down to the closing bell on the final day of the third  quarter on Wall Street.  The Dow is lower.  This is STREETSWEEP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A medication used to relieve pain for millions of people is now a source of  pain for the company that makes it.  Merck [Company: Merck &amp; Co. Inc.;   Ticker: MRK ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.merck.com\">http://www.merck.com</url>/] is pulling its arthritis drug  Vioxx effective immediately.  And investors are pulling out of Merck.  That  stock is down 27 percent.  That`s roughly $27 billion of lost market cap.   The stock now at the lowest price in eight years.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fred Katayama was at a Merck press conference earlier this morning.  He  joins us now with the details.  Fred?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Christine, the more than a  million arthritis patients in the U.S. now taking Vioxx will soon have to  stop taking it.  It`s manufacturer Merck is pulling Vioxx off the world- wide market.  The company made the decision after clinical tests results  showed the drug raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RAYMOND GILMARTIN, CEO, MERCK:  Importantly, in the first 18 months of the  study, there is no difference in the risk for heart attack or stroke in  patients taking either Vioxx or placebo.  Beginning after 18 months,  however, the risk of a cardiovascular event did increase among those on  Vioxx.  Accordingly, we are voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx effective today. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KATAYAMA:  The bombshell announcement came just weeks after Merck had  insisted Vioxx was safe.  An FDA study had showed that patients taking high  doses of Vioxx had a three-times greater chance of a heart attack than  those not taking painkillers.  But today the Food and Drug Administration  said Merck did the right thing in reporting its findings.  And it said it  would closely monitor other arthritis drugs for similar side effects. </p><p>But Merck`s investors got burned.  Shares of the drug company sank to their  lowest levels in nearly a decade.  The Vioxx withdrawal will cut into  Merck`s profits this year.  It`s $2.5 billion in revenues make up more than  a tenth of the company`s sales.  For now, patients on Vioxx can switch to  other arthritis drugs like Celebrex. </p><p>Merck says it`s clinical results do not necessarily apply to other drugs in  it`s class.  But some analysts say Merck`s findings might make patients  more cautious about taking other arthritis drugs. </p><p>ROMANS:  OK.  Let`s talk about the company.  Let`s talk about the  executives of the company.  Ray Gilmartin, the CEO at that press conference  this morning.  Even before this happened, there had been people on the  street who have been saying the performance of the company was sub par and  maybe he should resign.  What do you say? </p><p>KATAYAMA:  Well, the reporters did ask him at the press conference if he  was going to step down.  He said no.  </p><p>ROMANS:  What are the analysts saying about how well he`s handling this  crisis? </p><p>KATAYAMA:  Some people say it was good that he stepped up and voluntarily  pushed forward instead of waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to  mandate a withdrawal.  So in a sense, the positive spin on this story is  that Pfizer [Company: Pfizer Inc.; Ticker:  PFE; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pfizer.com\">http://www.pfizer.com</url>/] took an active role in trying to  -- you know, what  people call  a proactive role in trying to withdraw the drugs from the  market before it created any harm. </p><p>But as you know, he`s been under a lot of pressure.  He said he`s not going  to resign. </p><p>ROMANS:  This has been a heavily advertised drug.  A lot of people now --  what are people supposed to do who are on the drug?  And I can`t imagine  how this is going to change the entire landscape for arthritis medications.   And for the other companies that make these medications.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  The people who are currently on the drug, they are advised to  stop taking it.  Right now Pfizer is working with the medical profession to  try to get those drugs off the shelves and to get patients worldwide to  stop taking this drug.  Now there are other options for those patients.   That`s the good news. </p><p>For example, they can turn to Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer.  And there  are other arthritis drugs on the market.  And drug analysts feel that the  company that will benefit the most out of this is Pfizer, because Celebrex  is currently the best-selling arthritis drug on the market.  Another  beneficiary Chris, according to analyst in Merrill Lynch could be Schering- Plough.</p><p>ROMANS:  Oh really?</p><p>KATAYAMA:  And the reason is because now that Merck is really under  pressure, remember, Merck has had a weak pipeline for several years. </p><p>ROMANS:  Sure.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  The analyst community has said Merck you have to combine with  some other company the way that Pfizer bought out Warner-Lambert.  We saw  consolidation in the sector.  Merck said, no we`re going to go it alone.   Well, the Merrill analyst thinks that is going to pressure Merck to perhaps  swallow another company, possibly Schering-Plough.  You know, you got to  fill that pipeline.</p><p>ROMANS:  Absolutely.</p><p>KATAYAMA:  Especially with the $2.5 billion in revenues taken out with this  Vioxx drug. </p><p>ROMANS:  A very big story.  And I am sure we are not going to hear the last  of it.  All right.  Thanks, Fred Katayama.   </p><p>Merck`s top competitor in the arthritis medication field as Fred said,  Pfizer.  And it`s shares are higher today.  Shares of Pfizer, which makes  Celebrex up more than 1 percent. </p><p>Later in the program in our five for five segment, I`ll speak with a money  manager who says Pfizer is a good pick for your portfolio over the next  five years. </p><p>Merck`s loss today accounts for the entire drop in the Dow Industrials.   Without it, the market would actually be up.  Rhonda Schaffler live at the  New York Stock Exchange.  Rhonda?</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  Hi Christine.  </p><p>Well, as you can imagine, this story really has taken stage on Wall Street.   And not only is the broader market OK.  Advancers are actually leading  decliners by a 3/2 margin.  We have a situation here where Merck is going  to impact the numbers for the quarter for the Dow with this very dramatic  close that we are expecting here. </p><p>Obviously, it will be difficult for any sort of recovery late in the day.   NASDAQ, though, is in a lot better shape when we look at the chart.  Again  because remember, there is underlying strength in the market today.  You  are just not seeing it with the Dow because of Merck, which is dominating  the action here.  Merck, in fact, is the most actively traded stock at the  New York Stock Exchange today.  Down about 26 percent. </p><p>This will also be one of these days where this action will go in the record  books.  Because at this point, the trading in Merck is on tap to have one  of the top 10 one-day volumes in a single stock.  So this has been a very  huge story here.  You are looking at how some of the other drug stocks are  faring.  Obviously we`ve touch on Pfizer and Celebrex, which would benefit  from this news from Merck.</p><p>There are other big stories too.  Fannie Mae [Company: Fannie Mae ; Ticker:  FNM ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fanniemae.com\">http://www.fanniemae.com</url>/]  for instance.  This one has been a  big story it seems every day.  That stock is off again as the Justice  Department has opened an investigation into possible accounting fraud at  that company.  This comes after Fannie Mae`s government regulators said  last week the company may have manipulated it`s books.  The agency also now  will issue monthly reports regarding the company`s capital.  Used to send  out those reports quarterly. </p><p>Also on the earnings front, Fresh Del Monte [Company: Fresh Del Monte  Produce Inc.; Ticker: FDP; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.freshdelmonte.com\">http://www.freshdelmonte.com</url>/] produce cut  its earnings forecast for the full year by some 50 cents a share.  Del  Monte now sees 2004 earnings of $2.05 to $2.15 a share.  It cites lower  banana prices, less profitable shares of domestic melons, go figure.  And  hurricane-ravaged Florida tomatoes.  All those reasons sending the stock  sharply lower. </p><p>And now let`s look at Gateway [Company: Gateway Inc.; Ticker:  GTW; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gateway.com\">http://www.gateway.com</url>/].  A little bit of a different picture here.   Gateway is unveiling a new line of desktop PCs. Customers will be able to  customize their new models.  Gateway also says the higher end models will  have a different technology than previous systems.  Earlier this month  Gateway said it was going to shift its focus back to PCs. Wall Street  applauding that particular piece of news.  Christine? </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Rhonda Schaffler, thanks very much Rhonda, on as you  said, a very big news day. </p><p>That stunning Merck decline comes on the final day of a rough quarter for a  lot of stock investors.  Susan Green of IDI joins me now from the New York  Stock Exchange.  First, you heard Rhonda say this could be one of the top  10 trading days of any individual stock in Merck.  A huge move.  Susan,  give us a little bit of a sense how unusual it is to see a Dow component  lose a quarter of its value in one day. </p><p>SUSAN GREEN, IDI:  It`s actually very unusual.  Something we haven`t seen  in quite a while.  If you take the 87 or 88 million shares out of the Dow  today we`re still looking at roughly 1.35 billion shares today, which is  pretty interesting.  But to see a company lose almost 30 percent of its  market value is extraordinary.  It doesn`t happen very often. </p><p>And I think on the point of positive to positivity here, if you look at the  way the stock opened, it opened and traded within a point-and-a-quarter all  day long.  So that 88 million shares has basically been range bound on the  opening and thereafter, which is very unusual. </p><p>ROMANS:  Talk to us a little bit about this coming on the last day of a  quarter.  I mean, you have got a lot of mutual funds that own this.   \"Morningstar\" was telling us that Magellan .  For those of you out there  who own Magellan the mutual fund, or Vanguard, you are looking at you know  a concentration of this particular stock in your portfolio.  It`s the last  day of the quarter.  So it`s tough to sort of get out of a position, isn`t  it? </p><p>GREEN:  Well, it would be tough to get out of the position if there was no  volume.  That could be the reason for the stock opening at a range, staying  there all day long, and trading the size that it`s trading today.  They  took us at a level to get it to trade.  End of the quarter, people want  out.  New money going in.  There`s a rotation going on in the stock.  It  needs to happen today.  This is important. </p><p>They`ve managed to get it done.  Then you also have to think about the fact  that the Dow should probably be up on the day because of Merck being in the  component, and just the way we`re seeing the market now.  The money flow is  directly into the market at the end of the quarter, which is actually  pretty positive. </p><p>ROMANS:  That`s a really good way to look at it, stripping out Merck.   Merck right now is accounting for some 80, almost 90 points of Dow.  The  downside if you took it out, you`d actually have the Dow up a little bit. </p><p>OK.  Another little factoid I wanted to give you.  The Nasdaq on track for  its worst quarter, even if it closed higher today, on track for its worst  quarter in two years.  It was a tough quarter for tech stocks.  Do you feel  as though there could be some momentum in the other direction for the  fourth quarter? </p><p>GREEN:  Well, they actually tried doing it.  I mean, they got the  semiconductor index, the stocks down to a level where it started trading  based on the trading range.  So technically, it feels as if tech stocks are  actually bottomed out. But it wasn`t enough.  There`s not enough momentum  going into these stocks for the end of the quarter to get us going.</p><p>As we know, tech, and Nasdaq is generally tech driven, is basically forward  looking.  So what we need to see, management start coming out with earnings  within the next two weeks is what the guidance is going to be.  That`s what  the focus is going to be on.  That`s the only thing that`s going to get us  through to the fourth quarter. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Susan Green on the final day of a quarter.  Thanks for  stopping by Susan. </p><p>GREEN:  Thanks Christine.</p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up next on STREETSWEEP, more evidence the consumer is  cutting back.  At the same time jobless claims jump to the highest level in  seven months.  Kathleen Hays will be there to give us that.</p><p>Also, they are setting the stage for tonight`s first presidential debate,  but do we already know the winner in November?  Some say the economy is  giving us some pretty strong clues as to who will win the White House. </p><p>And what are the five best stocks for the next five years?  Today`s stock  picker says stick with the big names.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ROMANS:  More evidence the consumer may be holding back.  At the same the  unemployment line, the longest in seven months and the government blames  hurricanes.  Kathleen Hays is here to take a look. </p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we know hurricanes  don`t help much when people are trying to get to work, when there`s power  lines down, when the water is not running.  Of course there could be some  more people filing for unemployment benefits.  But let me give you the  numbers.  And you see that all hurricanes are not.  Jobless claims jumped  by 18,000 to 369,000.  That`s the highest level since about mid-February.</p><p>And, of course, it is fair to say, look, yes, we`ve had three weeks in a  row now of claims moving higher.  But we have also had these storms.  That  has to skew the numbers.  Bottom line is that four-week moving average,  actually this number overall is really kind of stuck in a range.  If you  just take this trend, it`s around 340,000, it isn`t going up, and it isn`t  going down.  It seems like the movement towards a healthier labor market,  if you look just at claims, has stalled.</p><p>But it`s stalled at a decent level.  Another thing to add in here though is  the help wanted index from the conference board, which measures column  inches of help wanted ads across the country, unchanged again in August.   The same level as last year.  And Ken Goldstein over at the conference  board says that this stagnant labor market is eating into consumer  confidence.  That`s something we saw earlier this week. </p><p>Speaking of the consumer, consumer spending out today.  This is the broad  measure of consumer spending, not just retail sales.  Not just spending on  items, on goods.  This includes spending on airline tickets, doctors  office, and education.  A very broad measure.  That number was flat.   That`s not such a good number.  Now of course, we did have two previous  months of gains, maybe a lull isn`t surprising. </p><p>We do have wage growth boosting income.  That`s the raw material for future  spending.  Maybe we`ll have a pickup.  That is the big question now.  One  thing I can tell you is inflation is looking very flame in this report as  it has in others.  It looks like companies still don`t have pricing power.   Christine.  Because a (INAUDIBLE), if the price is too high, we say no  thanks.  I don`t want to buy it.</p><p>ROMANS:  Right.  Absolutely.  Ok, now the economy not the first focus of  the first presidential debate. </p><p>HAYS:  How could they not?  How could they go past the economy? </p><p>ROMANS:  They`ll get to it.  They`ll get to it.  </p><p>HAYS:  The third debate.  Tonight of course, it`s foreign policy and  homeland security.  But it`s still about money, isn`t it?  Worried about  the budget deficit.  We`re worried about the dollar cost and things.  So we  just wanted to give you some facts on the figures. </p><p>In the 2005 fiscal year budget, national security, think of the Pentagon,  think of troops, think of new planes, all kind of things, that`s $420  billion.  The war next year, or this fiscal year I should say is going to  cost us $50 billion, at least.  Homeland security comes in at $32 billion  for a total of $500 billion.  And that is about one-fifth, isn`t it, of the  total budget of $2.4 trillion.  So that does put it in perspective.  It  also shows really, how important this is.</p><p>Everybody would say whatever it costs.  Whatever it costs for homeland  security.  Whatever it costs to be strong in the world.  It is a cost  though.  And spending that money of course takes money away from other  things.  </p><p>ROMANS:  Jobs also a big on the campaign trail.  October 8th is the last  jobs report before the election. </p><p>HAYS:  Isn`t that interesting?  Yes.  So this is the last one we`ll get to  see.  And then I think we get one more GDP report as well.  And it will be  the first look at third quarter GDP.  I think we also get that before-</p><p>ROMANS:  Very important.</p><p>HAYS:  It will be very important. </p><p>ROMANS:  It`s interesting.  Because depending on which camp you talk to.   You talk to the Kerry camp and they`ll say things like 3.9 million  Americans have simply exhausted their unemployment benefits over the last  year.  So when you talk about unemployment rates, you talk about people  getting jobs, keep in mind, there are almost 4 million people who simply  ran out of unemployment benefits and can`t find jobs.  </p><p>But the Bush administration will say look, the momentum has been good over  the past year.  So it`s so political -- </p><p>HAYS:  And we don`t know for sure.  I will say though, I think what`s  interesting when Dick Cheney says don`t worry, lots of those people are  selling things on eBay [Company: eBay Inc.; Ticker:  EBAY ; URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ebay.com\">http://www.ebay.com</url>/] .  I would say, Mr. Cheney though, is that a sign of  health that people are making a living by selling stuff on eBay, or a sign  that they don`t have anything else to do?  Kind of arguing to the Kerry  point.  But it`s -- </p><p>ROMANS:  It`s certainly not the best job market in 20 years.  It`s not the  worst job market in three generations.</p><p>HAYS:  That`s right.</p><p>ROMANS:  Somewhere in the middle.  All right.  Thank you very much  Kathleen.</p><p>Still ahead on STREETSWEEP, fresh questions about Fannie Mae`s accounting  drag its shares to the lowest level in a year.  And the next step may be a  criminal case.</p><p>Also, Merck gets high marks for the way it`s handling the Vioxx crisis.   Can the company recover? </p><p>With a few minutes left until the closing bell, stocks are down.  The Dow  down 59 points, 10,076.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ROMANS:  Violence took a heavy toll in Iraq and in the Middle East.  In  Iraq, multiple car bombs rocked the capital killing 44 people, most of them  children.  That makes September the worst month for car bombs to date.   More casualties came from a U.S. air strike in Fallujah, and violence near  Mosul. </p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that violence is escalating,  and said he expects it to get even worse as Iraqi elections approach.  One  Iraqi official says the county`s security forces are preparing a major  offensive against the insurgents. </p><p>A bloody day in Gaza as well, where Israeli soldiers tried to halt a series  of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants.  In one marketplace, civilians  were caught in the crossfire.  A senior commander for Hamas said Israeli  troops must retreat from the battle sites if they want the rocket attacks  to stop. </p><p>And residents of Washington State are keeping a wary eye on the Cascades.   The area around Mount St. Helens is under a volcano advisory.  Geologists  say the volcano could erupt in coming days or weeks.  Officials say the  damage could be minimal or moderate, but note that seismic activity has  been rising steadily.</p><p>Back in the markets now.  For the third time this week, one of our five for  five stock pickers is recommending Pfizer as a stock for the long term.  Richard Steinberg says investors should focus on mega large cap stocks.  He  also has four other picks to share with u this afternoon.  We`re looking  for five great stocks for the next five years.  He joins me now from  (INAUDIBLE) Florida.</p><p>Welcome to the program. </p><p>RICHARD STEINBERG, STEINBERG GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hey Christine, good  to see you again. </p><p>ROMANS:  Let`s talk first about Pfizer.  Because what better day for you to  come and say you think investors for the long-term should be buying Pfizer.   It`s up today.  A lot of people are talking about it and its drug Celebrex,  because of what`s happening with Vioxx and Merck. </p><p>STEINBERG:  Right.  Do I have blood here?  Because we also own a lot of  Merck.  I had an anvil fall on my head today. </p><p>ROMANS:  Oh man.  What are you going to do -- first of all, what are going  to do with your Merck shares?  Are you going to get out, or are you going  to buy more here?  Because it`s pretty cheap.  </p><p>STEINBERG:  We were on the conference call.  And if you remember, about a  year or so ago, you and I had Ray Gilmartin on your show. </p><p>ROMANS:  That`s right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I think for now we`re going to sit tight and let things settle  in.  And look to just kind of analyze things as they go on.  And not panic  out of the name.  But Pfizer still has a great franchise.  They`re going to  earn over $2.36 next year.  We`re looking for companies that are either  number one or number two market share in their markets now.  </p><p>They were number one or two.  And Celebrex, now there`s only one left  really.  So I think that that $2.36 could be light.  And it could be a lot  higher.  And I think the pipeline still is very strong for Pfizer.  It`s  trading at 13 multiple.  Good yield.  I think that`s also a trend we have  to look for, is getting paid to wait. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Let`s talk about General Electric [Company:  General  Electric Company;  Ticker: GE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ge.com\">http://www.ge.com</url>/] ; It`s also on your  list.  It`s another name that someone mentioned earlier this week too.  So  this is a big mega cap name.  It`s got exposure to a whole bunch of  different businesses, from jet engines, to the media.  Why do you like it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, if we get back to our five-year theme of having globally  diversified businesses, GE is a basically a bet that the long-term global  economy continues to grow.  They`re going to earn $1.78 this year.  The  six-sigma approach of getting out of businesses that they shouldn`t be in  continues to work well.  </p><p>Jeffrey Immelt`s doing an excellent job of kind of reining things in.  The  yield`s 2-plus percent.  And I think it`s a name that over a long-term  gives you broad exposure.  And a name that of you have a long enough time  horizon, like five years, you should own. </p><p>ROMANS:  This is a name that also gives you a broad global exposure as  well.  I mean, I know this is a big player in the global outsourcing  business. </p><p>STEINBERG:  IBM, absolutely.  They`ll going to earn $5.50 next year.   Stocks relatively cheap.  Cap ex spending and -- </p><p>ROMANS:  You`re talking about IBM [Company:  International Business  Machines Corporation; Ticker:  IBM; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibm.com\">http://www.ibm.com</url>/] here or GE? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, I`m sorry, GE, I`m sorry.  GE global outsourcing is still a  big deal.  But I think it`s more about getting some of the problems out of  the way that they have, where they`ve had with power generation and  aircrafts. </p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  You mentioned IBM.  Another big tech name.  Another  very well known blue chip name.  In the papers in the news today because of  a settlement, a payment, because of the way it sort of switched over some  of its retirees pensions.  Are you concerned about it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  I`m not concerned about the retirees.  There`s always kind of  complaining when things get changed a bit.  But the long-term story with  IBM is really more about the -- their ability to have a smoother revenue  stream than most tech companies, because of the recurring revenues from  consulting and services. </p><p>Citigroup [Company: Citigroup Inc.;  Ticker: C;  URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.citi.com\">http://www.citi.com</url>/]  .  Sally Krawcheck.  What do you think about that move?  Some changes over  at Citi lately.  Are you interested in Citigroup because of the way this  management is positioned?  Are you interested in it because it`s the  biggest player out there?  Why do you like it? </p><p>STEINBERG:  Global reach in financial services, 10 times earnings, great  yield.  Obviously, with the change in interest rates that are occurring, I  believe that their balance sheet liability exposure is well positioned for  a bump up in rates.  And again, if I look out five years, and I want global  exposure, two names, I think Citigroup has to be a core holding. </p><p>ROMANS:  Target [Company:  Target Corporation;  Ticker: TGT;  URL:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.targetcorp.com\">http://www.targetcorp.com</url>/] is a number two to Wal-Mart [Company: Wal-Mart  Stores Inc.; Ticker: WMT ; URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wal-mart.com\">http://www.wal-mart.com</url>/] .  You know, Wal- Mart seems to gobble up everything every place it goes.  It`s the biggest  retailer.  The biggest everything.  How can Target position itself with  Wal-Mart sort of as the big you know, gorilla in the field? </p><p>STEINBERG:  I think this is the PT boat outmaneuvering the large aircraft  carrier right now.  Target is going to earn $2.60 this year.  They`ve shed  Marshall Fields , which was kind of the albatross.  And I think that as we  go through kind of these pitfalls and ups and downs in the economy, the  market will continue to drive towards that discount retailing. </p><p>Wal-Mart is still the 800-pound gorilla, but doesn`t mean the baby gorilla  can`t make money along the way.

Talk to our viewer, the average investor who  is looking out for five years trying to build some sort of portfolio. </p><p>STEINBERG:  So the first thing that you need to do is you need to know what  you own.  The second thing is, I think if you focus on large, easy to  understand companies, you have a much better ability to have successful  performance and not get caught up in the latest technological changes. </p><p>The other thing is you want to focus on companies that can dominate their  market share, that have a diversified business model, and have very strong  management.  You have to be able to distinguish the difference between  owning a good company, and owning a good stock. </p><p>If you can bring those pieces together and focus on also getting paid to  wait with some dividends where possible, I think, as we go through a  transition in the economy over the next five years, we`ll, -- you`ll be  successful. </p><p>ROMANS:  Richard Steinberg thanks so much for joining us.

Counting down to the closing bell on the final day of the third quarter on Wall Street. The Dow is lower. This is STREETSWEEP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A medication used to relieve pain for millions of people is now a source of pain for the company that makes it. Merck [Company: Merck &amp; Co. Inc.; Ticker: MRK ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.merck.com\">http://www.merck.com</url>/] is pulling its arthritis drug Vioxx effective immediately. And investors are pulling out of Merck. That stock is down 27 percent. That`s roughly $27 billion of lost market cap. The stock now at the lowest price in eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fred Katayama was at a Merck press conference earlier this morning. He joins us now with the details. Fred?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, the more than a million arthritis patients in the U.S. now taking Vioxx will soon have to stop taking it. It`s manufacturer Merck is pulling Vioxx off the world- wide market. The company made the decision after clinical tests results showed the drug raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAYMOND GILMARTIN, CEO, MERCK: Importantly, in the first 18 months of the study, there is no difference in the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients taking either Vioxx or placebo. Beginning after 18 months, however, the risk of a cardiovascular event did increase among those on Vioxx. Accordingly, we are voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx effective today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATAYAMA: The bombshell announcement came just weeks after Merck had insisted Vioxx was safe. An FDA study had showed that patients taking high doses of Vioxx had a three-times greater chance of a heart attack than those not taking painkillers. But today the Food and Drug Administration said Merck did the right thing in reporting its findings. And it said it would closely monitor other arthritis drugs for similar side effects.</p><p>But Merck`s investors got burned. Shares of the drug company sank to their lowest levels in nearly a decade. The Vioxx withdrawal will cut into Merck`s profits this year. It`s $2.5 billion in revenues make up more than a tenth of the company`s sales. For now, patients on Vioxx can switch to other arthritis drugs like Celebrex.</p><p>Merck says it`s clinical results do not necessarily apply to other drugs in it`s class. But some analysts say Merck`s findings might make patients more cautious about taking other arthritis drugs.</p><p>ROMANS: OK. Let`s talk about the company. Let`s talk about the executives of the company. Ray Gilmartin, the CEO at that press conference this morning. Even before this happened, there had been people on the street who have been saying the performance of the company was sub par and maybe he should resign. What do you say?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Well, the reporters did ask him at the press conference if he was going to step down. He said no.</p><p>ROMANS: What are the analysts saying about how well he`s handling this crisis?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Some people say it was good that he stepped up and voluntarily pushed forward instead of waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to mandate a withdrawal. So in a sense, the positive spin on this story is that Pfizer [Company: Pfizer Inc.; Ticker: PFE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pfizer.com\">http://www.pfizer.com</url>/] took an active role in trying to -- you know, what people call a proactive role in trying to withdraw the drugs from the market before it created any harm.</p><p>But as you know, he`s been under a lot of pressure. He said he`s not going to resign.</p><p>ROMANS: This has been a heavily advertised drug. A lot of people now -- what are people supposed to do who are on the drug? And I can`t imagine how this is going to change the entire landscape for arthritis medications. And for the other companies that make these medications.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The people who are currently on the drug, they are advised to stop taking it. Right now Pfizer is working with the medical profession to try to get those drugs off the shelves and to get patients worldwide to stop taking this drug. Now there are other options for those patients. That`s the good news.</p><p>For example, they can turn to Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer. And there are other arthritis drugs on the market. And drug analysts feel that the company that will benefit the most out of this is Pfizer, because Celebrex is currently the best-selling arthritis drug on the market. Another beneficiary Chris, according to analyst in Merrill Lynch could be Schering- Plough.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh really?</p><p>KATAYAMA: And the reason is because now that Merck is really under pressure, remember, Merck has had a weak pipeline for several years.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The analyst community has said Merck you have to combine with some other company the way that Pfizer bought out Warner-Lambert. We saw consolidation in the sector. Merck said, no we`re going to go it alone. Well, the Merrill analyst thinks that is going to pressure Merck to perhaps swallow another company, possibly Schering-Plough. You know, you got to fill that pipeline.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Especially with the $2.5 billion in revenues taken out with this Vioxx drug.</p><p>ROMANS: A very big story. And I am sure we are not going to hear the last of it. All right. Thanks, Fred Katayama.</p><p>Merck`s top competitor in the arthritis medication field as Fred said, Pfizer. And it`s shares are higher today. Shares of Pfizer, which makes Celebrex up more than 1 percent.</p><p>Later in the program in our five for five segment, I`ll speak with a money manager who says Pfizer is a good pick for your portfolio over the next five years.</p><p>Merck`s loss today accounts for the entire drop in the Dow Industrials. Without it, the market would actually be up. Rhonda Schaffler live at the New York Stock Exchange. Rhonda?</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: Hi Christine.</p><p>Well, as you can imagine, this story really has taken stage on Wall Street. And not only is the broader market OK. Advancers are actually leading decliners by a 3/2 margin. We have a situation here where Merck is going to impact the numbers for the quarter for the Dow with this very dramatic close that we are expecting here.</p><p>Obviously, it will be difficult for any sort of recovery late in the day. NASDAQ, though, is in a lot better shape when we look at the chart. Again because remember, there is underlying strength in the market today. You are just not seeing it with the Dow because of Merck, which is dominating the action here. Merck, in fact, is the most actively traded stock at the New York Stock Exchange today. Down about 26 percent.</p><p>This will also be one of these days where this action will go in the record books. Because at this point, the trading in Merck is on tap to have one of the top 10 one-day volumes in a single stock. So this has been a very huge story here. You are looking at how some of the other drug stocks are faring. Obviously we`ve touch on Pfizer and Celebrex, which would benefit from this news from Merck.</p><p>There are other big stories too. Fannie Mae [Company: Fannie Mae ; Ticker: FNM ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fanniemae.com\">http://www.fanniemae.com</url>/] for instance. This one has been a big story it seems every day. That stock is off again as the Justice Department has opened an investigation into possible accounting fraud at that company. This comes after Fannie Mae`s government regulators said last week the company may have manipulated it`s books. The agency also now will issue monthly reports regarding the company`s capital. Used to send out those reports quarterly.</p><p>Also on the earnings front, Fresh Del Monte [Company: Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.; Ticker: FDP; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.freshdelmonte.com\">http://www.freshdelmonte.com</url>/] produce cut its earnings forecast for the full year by some 50 cents a share. Del Monte now sees 2004 earnings of $2.05 to $2.15 a share. It cites lower banana prices, less profitable shares of domestic melons, go figure. And hurricane-ravaged Florida tomatoes. All those reasons sending the stock sharply lower. </p><p>And now let`s look at Gateway [Company: Gateway Inc.; Ticker: GTW; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gateway.com\">http://www.gateway.com</url>/]. A little bit of a different picture here. Gateway is unveiling a new line of desktop PCs. Customers will be able to customize their new models. Gateway also says the higher end models will have a different technology than previous systems. Earlier this month Gateway said it was going to shift its focus back to PCs. Wall Street applauding that particular piece of news. Christine?</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Rhonda Schaffler, thanks very much Rhonda, on as you said, a very big news day.</p><p>That stunning Merck decline comes on the final day of a rough quarter for a lot of stock investors. Susan Green of IDI joins me now from the New York Stock Exchange. First, you heard Rhonda say this could be one of the top 10 trading days of any individual stock in Merck. A huge move. Susan, give us a little bit of a sense how unusual it is to see a Dow component lose a quarter of its value in one day.</p><p>SUSAN GREEN, IDI: It`s actually very unusual. Something we haven`t seen in quite a while. If you take the 87 or 88 million shares out of the Dow today we`re still looking at roughly 1.35 billion shares today, which is pretty interesting. But to see a company lose almost 30 percent of its market value is extraordinary. It doesn`t happen very often.</p><p>And I think on the point of positive to positivity here, if you look at the way the stock opened, it opened and traded within a point-and-a-quarter all day long. So that 88 million shares has basically been range bound on the opening and thereafter, which is very unusual.</p><p>ROMANS: Talk to us a little bit about this coming on the last day of a quarter. I mean, you have got a lot of mutual funds that own this. \"Morningstar\" was telling us that Magellan . For those of you out there who own Magellan the mutual fund, or Vanguard, you are looking at you know a concentration of this particular stock in your portfolio. It`s the last day of the quarter. So it`s tough to sort of get out of a position, isn`t it?</p><p>GREEN: Well, it would be tough to get out of the position if there was no volume. That could be the reason for the stock opening at a range, staying there all day long, and trading the size that it`s trading today. They took us at a level to get it to trade. End of the quarter, people want out. New money going in. There`s a rotation going on in the stock. It needs to happen today. This is important.</p><p>They`ve managed to get it done. Then you also have to think about the fact that the Dow should probably be up on the day because of Merck being in the component, and just the way we`re seeing the market now. The money flow is directly into the market at the end of the quarter, which is actually pretty positive.</p><p>ROMANS: That`s a really good way to look at it, stripping out Merck. Merck right now is accounting for some 80, almost 90 points of Dow. The downside if you took it out, you`d actually have the Dow up a little bit.</p><p>OK. Another little factoid I wanted to give you. The Nasdaq on track for its worst quarter, even if it closed higher today, on track for its worst quarter in two years. It was a tough quarter for tech stocks. Do you feel as though there could be some momentum in the other direction for the fourth quarter?</p><p>GREEN: Well, they actually tried doing it. I mean, they got the semiconductor index, the stocks down to a level where it started trading based on the trading range. So technically, it feels as if tech stocks are actually bottomed out. But it wasn`t enough. There`s not enough momentum going into these stocks for the end of the quarter to get us going.</p><p>As we know, tech, and Nasdaq is generally tech driven, is basically forward looking. So what we need to see, management start coming out with earnings within the next two weeks is what the guidance is going to be. That`s what the focus is going to be on. That`s the only thing that`s going to get us through to the fourth quarter.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Susan Green on the final day of a quarter. Thanks for stopping by Susan.</p><p>GREEN: Thanks Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up next on STREETSWEEP, more evidence the consumer is cutting back. At the same time jobless claims jump to the highest level in seven months. Kathleen Hays will be there to give us that.</p><p>Also, they are setting the stage for tonight`s first presidential debate, but do we already know the winner in November? Some say the economy is giving us some pretty strong clues as to who will win the White House.</p><p>And what are the five best stocks for the next five years? Today`s stock picker says stick with the big names.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: More evidence the consumer may be holding back. At the same the unemployment line, the longest in seven months and the government blames hurricanes. Kathleen Hays is here to take a look.</p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know hurricanes don`t help much when people are trying to get to work, when there`s power lines down, when the water is not running. Of course there could be some more people filing for unemployment benefits. But let me give you the numbers. And you see that all hurricanes are not. Jobless claims jumped by 18,000 to 369,000. That`s the highest level since about mid-February.</p><p>And, of course, it is fair to say, look, yes, we`ve had three weeks in a row now of claims moving higher. But we have also had these storms. That has to skew the numbers. Bottom line is that four-week moving average, actually this number overall is really kind of stuck in a range. If you just take this trend, it`s around 340,000, it isn`t going up, and it isn`t going down. It seems like the movement towards a healthier labor market, if you look just at claims, has stalled.</p><p>But it`s stalled at a decent level. Another thing to add in here though is the help wanted index from the conference board, which measures column inches of help wanted ads across the country, unchanged again in August. The same level as last year. And Ken Goldstein over at the conference board says that this stagnant labor market is eating into consumer confidence. That`s something we saw earlier this week.</p><p>Speaking of the consumer, consumer spending out today. This is the broad measure of consumer spending, not just retail sales. Not just spending on items, on goods. This includes spending on airline tickets, doctors office, and education. A very broad measure. That number was flat. That`s not such a good number. Now of course, we did have two previous months of gains, maybe a lull isn`t surprising.</p><p>We do have wage growth boosting income. That`s the raw material for future spending. Maybe we`ll have a pickup. That is the big question now. One thing I can tell you is inflation is looking very flame in this report as it has in others. It looks like companies still don`t have pricing power. Christine. Because a (INAUDIBLE), if the price is too high, we say no thanks. I don`t want to buy it.</p><p>ROMANS: Right. Absolutely. Ok, now the economy not the first focus of the first presidential debate.</p><p>HAYS: How could they not? How could they go past the economy?</p><p>ROMANS: They`ll get to it. They`ll get to it.</p><p>HAYS: The third debate. Tonight of course, it`s foreign policy and homeland security. But it`s still about money, isn`t it? Worried about the budget deficit. We`re worried about the dollar cost and things. So we just wanted to give you some facts on the figures.</p><p>In the 2005 fiscal year budget, national security, think of the Pentagon, think of troops, think of new planes, all kind of things, that`s $420 billion. The war next year, or this fiscal year I should say is going to cost us $50 billion, at least. Homeland security comes in at $32 billion for a total of $500 billion. And that is about one-fifth, isn`t it, of the total budget of $2.4 trillion. So that does put it in perspective. It also shows really, how important this is.</p><p>Everybody would say whatever it costs. Whatever it costs for homeland security. Whatever it costs to be strong in the world. It is a cost though. And spending that money of course takes money away from other things.</p><p>ROMANS: Jobs also a big on the campaign trail. October 8th is the last jobs report before the election.</p><p>HAYS: Isn`t that interesting? Yes. So this is the last one we`ll get to see. And then I think we get one more GDP report as well. And it will be the first look at third quarter GDP. I think we also get that before-</p><p>ROMANS: Very important.</p><p>HAYS: It will be very important.</p><p>ROMANS: It`s interesting. Because depending on which camp you talk to. You talk to the Kerry camp and they`ll say things like 3.9 million Americans have simply exhausted their unemployment benefits over the last year. So when you talk about unemployment rates, you talk about people getting jobs, keep in mind, there are almost 4 million people who simply ran out of unemployment benefits and can`t find jobs.</p><p>But the Bush administration will say look, the momentum has been good over the past year. So it`s so political --</p><p>HAYS: And we don`t know for sure. I will say though, I think what`s interesting when Dick Cheney says don`t worry, lots of those people are selling things on eBay [Company: eBay Inc.; Ticker: EBAY ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ebay.com\">http://www.ebay.com</url>/] . I would say, Mr. Cheney though, is that a sign of health that people are making a living by selling stuff on eBay, or a sign that they don`t have anything else to do? Kind of arguing to the Kerry point. But it`s --</p><p>ROMANS: It`s certainly not the best job market in 20 years. It`s not the worst job market in three generations.</p><p>HAYS: That`s right.</p><p>ROMANS: Somewhere in the middle. All right. Thank you very much Kathleen.</p><p>Still ahead on STREETSWEEP, fresh questions about Fannie Mae`s accounting drag its shares to the lowest level in a year. And the next step may be a criminal case.</p><p>Also, Merck gets high marks for the way it`s handling the Vioxx crisis. Can the company recover?</p><p>With a few minutes left until the closing bell, stocks are down. The Dow down 59 points, 10,076.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Violence took a heavy toll in Iraq and in the Middle East. In Iraq, multiple car bombs rocked the capital killing 44 people, most of them children. That makes September the worst month for car bombs to date. More casualties came from a U.S. air strike in Fallujah, and violence near Mosul.</p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that violence is escalating, and said he expects it to get even worse as Iraqi elections approach. One Iraqi official says the county`s security forces are preparing a major offensive against the insurgents.</p><p>A bloody day in Gaza as well, where Israeli soldiers tried to halt a series of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. In one marketplace, civilians were caught in the crossfire. A senior commander for Hamas said Israeli troops must retreat from the battle sites if they want the rocket attacks to stop.</p><p>And residents of Washington State are keeping a wary eye on the Cascades. The area around Mount St. Helens is under a volcano advisory. Geologists say the volcano could erupt in coming days or weeks. Officials say the damage could be minimal or moderate, but note that seismic activity has been rising steadily.</p><p>Back in the markets now. For the third time this week, one of our five for five stock pickers is recommending Pfizer as a stock for the long term. Richard Steinberg says investors should focus on mega large cap stocks. He also has four other picks to share with u this afternoon. We`re looking for five great stocks for the next five years. He joins me now from (INAUDIBLE) Florida.</p><p>Welcome to the program.</p><p>RICHARD STEINBERG, STEINBERG GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hey Christine, good to see you again.</p><p>ROMANS: Let`s talk first about Pfizer. Because what better day for you to come and say you think investors for the long-term should be buying Pfizer. It`s up today. A lot of people are talking about it and its drug Celebrex, because of what`s happening with Vioxx and Merck.</p><p>STEINBERG: Right. Do I have blood here? Because we also own a lot of Merck. I had an anvil fall on my head today.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh man. What are you going to do -- first of all, what are going to do with your Merck shares? Are you going to get out, or are you going to buy more here? Because it`s pretty cheap.</p><p>STEINBERG: We were on the conference call. And if you remember, about a year or so ago, you and I had Ray Gilmartin on your show.</p><p>ROMANS: That`s right.</p><p>STEINBERG: I think for now we`re going to sit tight and let things settle in. And look to just kind of analyze things as they go on. And not panic out of the name. But Pfizer still has a great franchise. They`re going to earn over $2.36 next year. We`re looking for companies that are either number one or number two market share in their markets now.</p><p>They were number one or two. And Celebrex, now there`s only one left really. So I think that that $2.36 could be light. And it could be a lot higher. And I think the pipeline still is very strong for Pfizer. It`s trading at 13 multiple. Good yield. I think that`s also a trend we have to look for, is getting paid to wait.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Let`s talk about General Electric [Company: General Electric Company; Ticker: GE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ge.com\">http://www.ge.com</url>/] ; It`s also on your list. It`s another name that someone mentioned earlier this week too. So this is a big mega cap name. It`s got exposure to a whole bunch of different businesses, from jet engines, to the media. Why do you like it?</p><p>STEINBERG: Well, if we get back to our five-year theme of having globally diversified businesses, GE is a basically a bet that the long-term global economy continues to grow. They`re going to earn $1.78 this year. The six-sigma approach of getting out of businesses that they shouldn`t be in continues to work well.</p><p>Jeffrey Immelt`s doing an excellent job of kind of reining things in. The yield`s 2-plus percent. And I think it`s a name that over a long-term gives you broad exposure. And a name that of you have a long enough time horizon, like five years, you should own.</p><p>ROMANS: This is a name that also gives you a broad global exposure as well. I mean, I know this is a big player in the global outsourcing business.</p><p>STEINBERG: IBM, absolutely. They`ll going to earn $5.50 next year. Stocks relatively cheap. Cap ex spending and --</p><p>ROMANS: You`re talking about IBM [Company: International Business Machines Corporation; Ticker: IBM; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibm.com\">http://www.ibm.com</url>/] here or GE?</p><p>STEINBERG: Oh, I`m sorry, GE, I`m sorry. GE global outsourcing is still a big deal. But I think it`s more about getting some of the problems out of the way that they have, where they`ve had with power generation and aircrafts.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. You mentioned IBM. Another big tech name. Another very well known blue chip name. In the papers in the news today because of a settlement, a payment, because of the way it sort of switched over some of its retirees pensions. Are you concerned about it?</p><p>STEINBERG: I`m not concerned about the retirees. There`s always kind of complaining when things get changed a bit. But the long-term story with IBM is really more about the -- their ability to have a smoother revenue stream than most tech companies, because of the recurring revenues from consulting and services.</p><p>Citigroup [Company: Citigroup Inc.; Ticker: C; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.citi.com\">http://www.citi.com</url>/] . Sally Krawcheck. What do you think about that move? Some changes over at Citi lately. Are you interested in Citigroup because of the way this management is positioned? Are you interested in it because it`s the biggest player out there? Why do you like it?</p><p>STEINBERG: Global reach in financial services, 10 times earnings, great yield. Obviously, with the change in interest rates that are occurring, I believe that their balance sheet liability exposure is well positioned for a bump up in rates. And again, if I look out five years, and I want global exposure, two names, I think Citigroup has to be a core holding.</p><p>ROMANS: Target [Company: Target Corporation; Ticker: TGT; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.targetcorp.com\">http://www.targetcorp.com</url>/] is a number two to Wal-Mart [Company: Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; Ticker: WMT ; URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wal-mart.com\">http://www.wal-mart.com</url>/] . You know, Wal- Mart seems to gobble up everything every place it goes. It`s the biggest retailer. The biggest everything. How can Target position itself with Wal-Mart sort of as the big you know, gorilla in the field?</p><p>STEINBERG: I think this is the PT boat outmaneuvering the large aircraft carrier right now. Target is going to earn $2.60 this year. They`ve shed Marshall Fields , which was kind of the albatross. And I think that as we go through kind of these pitfalls and ups and downs in the economy, the market will continue to drive towards that discount retailing.</p><p>Wal-Mart is still the 800-pound gorilla, but doesn`t mean the baby gorilla can`t make money along the way. I think in the short run, especially with some of the problems that they have in litigation, and litigation payments that Wal-Mart has, that they`re going to be able to make a lot of money.</p><p>ROMANS: Overall Richard, tell us a little bit about what kinds of criteria you use for picking stocks. Talk to our viewer, the average investor who is looking out for five years trying to build some sort of portfolio.</p><p>STEINBERG: So the first thing that you need to do is you need to know what you own. The second thing is, I think if you focus on large, easy to understand companies, you have a much better ability to have successful performance and not get caught up in the latest technological changes.</p><p>The other thing is you want to focus on companies that can dominate their market share, that have a diversified business model, and have very strong management. You have to be able to distinguish the difference between owning a good company, and owning a good stock.</p><p>If you can bring those pieces together and focus on also getting paid to wait with some dividends where possible, I think, as we go through a transition in the economy over the next five years, we`ll, -- you`ll be successful.</p><p>ROMANS: Richard Steinberg thanks so much for joining us. We`re going to put those stock picks on our web site if anybody missed them.</p><p>Still ahead, President George Bush and Senator John Kerry square off tonight in the first presidential debate. Their subject -- foreign policy.</p><p>Plus, a long-term look at Merck. Vioxx is one problem. But here`s another. Its patent for top-selling Zocor expires in about a year.</p><p>Moments to go to the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average down 71 points.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://WWW.FDCH.COM\">WWW.FDCH.COM</url></p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2004 Cable News Network, Inc.

Counting down to the closing bell on the final day of the third quarter on Wall Street. The Dow is lower. This is STREETSWEEP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A medication used to relieve pain for millions of people is now a source of pain for the company that makes it. Merck [Company: Merck &amp; Co. Inc.; Ticker: MRK ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.merck.com\">http://www.merck.com</url>/] is pulling its arthritis drug Vioxx effective immediately. And investors are pulling out of Merck. That stock is down 27 percent. That`s roughly $27 billion of lost market cap. The stock now at the lowest price in eight years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fred Katayama was at a Merck press conference earlier this morning. He joins us now with the details. Fred?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, the more than a million arthritis patients in the U.S. now taking Vioxx will soon have to stop taking it. It`s manufacturer Merck is pulling Vioxx off the world- wide market. The company made the decision after clinical tests results showed the drug raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAYMOND GILMARTIN, CEO, MERCK: Importantly, in the first 18 months of the study, there is no difference in the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients taking either Vioxx or placebo. Beginning after 18 months, however, the risk of a cardiovascular event did increase among those on Vioxx. Accordingly, we are voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx effective today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATAYAMA: The bombshell announcement came just weeks after Merck had insisted Vioxx was safe. An FDA study had showed that patients taking high doses of Vioxx had a three-times greater chance of a heart attack than those not taking painkillers. But today the Food and Drug Administration said Merck did the right thing in reporting its findings. And it said it would closely monitor other arthritis drugs for similar side effects.</p><p>But Merck`s investors got burned. Shares of the drug company sank to their lowest levels in nearly a decade. The Vioxx withdrawal will cut into Merck`s profits this year. It`s $2.5 billion in revenues make up more than a tenth of the company`s sales. For now, patients on Vioxx can switch to other arthritis drugs like Celebrex.</p><p>Merck says it`s clinical results do not necessarily apply to other drugs in it`s class. But some analysts say Merck`s findings might make patients more cautious about taking other arthritis drugs.</p><p>ROMANS: OK. Let`s talk about the company. Let`s talk about the executives of the company. Ray Gilmartin, the CEO at that press conference this morning. Even before this happened, there had been people on the street who have been saying the performance of the company was sub par and maybe he should resign. What do you say?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Well, the reporters did ask him at the press conference if he was going to step down. He said no.</p><p>ROMANS: What are the analysts saying about how well he`s handling this crisis?</p><p>KATAYAMA: Some people say it was good that he stepped up and voluntarily pushed forward instead of waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to mandate a withdrawal. So in a sense, the positive spin on this story is that Pfizer [Company: Pfizer Inc.; Ticker: PFE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pfizer.com\">http://www.pfizer.com</url>/] took an active role in trying to -- you know, what people call a proactive role in trying to withdraw the drugs from the market before it created any harm.</p><p>But as you know, he`s been under a lot of pressure. He said he`s not going to resign.</p><p>ROMANS: This has been a heavily advertised drug. A lot of people now -- what are people supposed to do who are on the drug? And I can`t imagine how this is going to change the entire landscape for arthritis medications. And for the other companies that make these medications.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The people who are currently on the drug, they are advised to stop taking it. Right now Pfizer is working with the medical profession to try to get those drugs off the shelves and to get patients worldwide to stop taking this drug. Now there are other options for those patients. That`s the good news.</p><p>For example, they can turn to Celebrex, which is made by Pfizer. And there are other arthritis drugs on the market. And drug analysts feel that the company that will benefit the most out of this is Pfizer, because Celebrex is currently the best-selling arthritis drug on the market. Another beneficiary Chris, according to analyst in Merrill Lynch could be Schering- Plough.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh really?</p><p>KATAYAMA: And the reason is because now that Merck is really under pressure, remember, Merck has had a weak pipeline for several years.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The analyst community has said Merck you have to combine with some other company the way that Pfizer bought out Warner-Lambert. We saw consolidation in the sector. Merck said, no we`re going to go it alone. Well, the Merrill analyst thinks that is going to pressure Merck to perhaps swallow another company, possibly Schering-Plough. You know, you got to fill that pipeline.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Especially with the $2.5 billion in revenues taken out with this Vioxx drug.</p><p>ROMANS: A very big story. And I am sure we are not going to hear the last of it. All right. Thanks, Fred Katayama.</p><p>Merck`s top competitor in the arthritis medication field as Fred said, Pfizer. And it`s shares are higher today. Shares of Pfizer, which makes Celebrex up more than 1 percent.</p><p>Later in the program in our five for five segment, I`ll speak with a money manager who says Pfizer is a good pick for your portfolio over the next five years.</p><p>Merck`s loss today accounts for the entire drop in the Dow Industrials. Without it, the market would actually be up. Rhonda Schaffler live at the New York Stock Exchange. Rhonda?</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: Hi Christine.</p><p>Well, as you can imagine, this story really has taken stage on Wall Street. And not only is the broader market OK. Advancers are actually leading decliners by a 3/2 margin. We have a situation here where Merck is going to impact the numbers for the quarter for the Dow with this very dramatic close that we are expecting here.</p><p>Obviously, it will be difficult for any sort of recovery late in the day. NASDAQ, though, is in a lot better shape when we look at the chart. Again because remember, there is underlying strength in the market today. You are just not seeing it with the Dow because of Merck, which is dominating the action here. Merck, in fact, is the most actively traded stock at the New York Stock Exchange today. Down about 26 percent.</p><p>This will also be one of these days where this action will go in the record books. Because at this point, the trading in Merck is on tap to have one of the top 10 one-day volumes in a single stock. So this has been a very huge story here. You are looking at how some of the other drug stocks are faring. Obviously we`ve touch on Pfizer and Celebrex, which would benefit from this news from Merck.</p><p>There are other big stories too. Fannie Mae [Company: Fannie Mae ; Ticker: FNM ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fanniemae.com\">http://www.fanniemae.com</url>/] for instance. This one has been a big story it seems every day. That stock is off again as the Justice Department has opened an investigation into possible accounting fraud at that company. This comes after Fannie Mae`s government regulators said last week the company may have manipulated it`s books. The agency also now will issue monthly reports regarding the company`s capital. Used to send out those reports quarterly.</p><p>Also on the earnings front, Fresh Del Monte [Company: Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.; Ticker: FDP; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.freshdelmonte.com\">http://www.freshdelmonte.com</url>/] produce cut its earnings forecast for the full year by some 50 cents a share. Del Monte now sees 2004 earnings of $2.05 to $2.15 a share. It cites lower banana prices, less profitable shares of domestic melons, go figure. And hurricane-ravaged Florida tomatoes. All those reasons sending the stock sharply lower. </p><p>And now let`s look at Gateway [Company: Gateway Inc.; Ticker: GTW; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gateway.com\">http://www.gateway.com</url>/]. A little bit of a different picture here. Gateway is unveiling a new line of desktop PCs. Customers will be able to customize their new models. Gateway also says the higher end models will have a different technology than previous systems. Earlier this month Gateway said it was going to shift its focus back to PCs. Wall Street applauding that particular piece of news. Christine?</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Rhonda Schaffler, thanks very much Rhonda, on as you said, a very big news day.</p><p>That stunning Merck decline comes on the final day of a rough quarter for a lot of stock investors. Susan Green of IDI joins me now from the New York Stock Exchange. First, you heard Rhonda say this could be one of the top 10 trading days of any individual stock in Merck. A huge move. Susan, give us a little bit of a sense how unusual it is to see a Dow component lose a quarter of its value in one day.</p><p>SUSAN GREEN, IDI: It`s actually very unusual. Something we haven`t seen in quite a while. If you take the 87 or 88 million shares out of the Dow today we`re still looking at roughly 1.35 billion shares today, which is pretty interesting. But to see a company lose almost 30 percent of its market value is extraordinary. It doesn`t happen very often.</p><p>And I think on the point of positive to positivity here, if you look at the way the stock opened, it opened and traded within a point-and-a-quarter all day long. So that 88 million shares has basically been range bound on the opening and thereafter, which is very unusual.</p><p>ROMANS: Talk to us a little bit about this coming on the last day of a quarter. I mean, you have got a lot of mutual funds that own this. \"Morningstar\" was telling us that Magellan . For those of you out there who own Magellan the mutual fund, or Vanguard, you are looking at you know a concentration of this particular stock in your portfolio. It`s the last day of the quarter. So it`s tough to sort of get out of a position, isn`t it?</p><p>GREEN: Well, it would be tough to get out of the position if there was no volume. That could be the reason for the stock opening at a range, staying there all day long, and trading the size that it`s trading today. They took us at a level to get it to trade. End of the quarter, people want out. New money going in. There`s a rotation going on in the stock. It needs to happen today. This is important.</p><p>They`ve managed to get it done. Then you also have to think about the fact that the Dow should probably be up on the day because of Merck being in the component, and just the way we`re seeing the market now. The money flow is directly into the market at the end of the quarter, which is actually pretty positive.</p><p>ROMANS: That`s a really good way to look at it, stripping out Merck. Merck right now is accounting for some 80, almost 90 points of Dow. The downside if you took it out, you`d actually have the Dow up a little bit.</p><p>OK. Another little factoid I wanted to give you. The Nasdaq on track for its worst quarter, even if it closed higher today, on track for its worst quarter in two years. It was a tough quarter for tech stocks. Do you feel as though there could be some momentum in the other direction for the fourth quarter?</p><p>GREEN: Well, they actually tried doing it. I mean, they got the semiconductor index, the stocks down to a level where it started trading based on the trading range. So technically, it feels as if tech stocks are actually bottomed out. But it wasn`t enough. There`s not enough momentum going into these stocks for the end of the quarter to get us going.</p><p>As we know, tech, and Nasdaq is generally tech driven, is basically forward looking. So what we need to see, management start coming out with earnings within the next two weeks is what the guidance is going to be. That`s what the focus is going to be on. That`s the only thing that`s going to get us through to the fourth quarter.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Susan Green on the final day of a quarter. Thanks for stopping by Susan.</p><p>GREEN: Thanks Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up next on STREETSWEEP, more evidence the consumer is cutting back. At the same time jobless claims jump to the highest level in seven months. Kathleen Hays will be there to give us that.</p><p>Also, they are setting the stage for tonight`s first presidential debate, but do we already know the winner in November? Some say the economy is giving us some pretty strong clues as to who will win the White House.</p><p>And what are the five best stocks for the next five years? Today`s stock picker says stick with the big names.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: More evidence the consumer may be holding back. At the same the unemployment line, the longest in seven months and the government blames hurricanes. Kathleen Hays is here to take a look.</p><p>KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know hurricanes don`t help much when people are trying to get to work, when there`s power lines down, when the water is not running. Of course there could be some more people filing for unemployment benefits. But let me give you the numbers. And you see that all hurricanes are not. Jobless claims jumped by 18,000 to 369,000. That`s the highest level since about mid-February.</p><p>And, of course, it is fair to say, look, yes, we`ve had three weeks in a row now of claims moving higher. But we have also had these storms. That has to skew the numbers. Bottom line is that four-week moving average, actually this number overall is really kind of stuck in a range. If you just take this trend, it`s around 340,000, it isn`t going up, and it isn`t going down. It seems like the movement towards a healthier labor market, if you look just at claims, has stalled.</p><p>But it`s stalled at a decent level. Another thing to add in here though is the help wanted index from the conference board, which measures column inches of help wanted ads across the country, unchanged again in August. The same level as last year. And Ken Goldstein over at the conference board says that this stagnant labor market is eating into consumer confidence. That`s something we saw earlier this week.</p><p>Speaking of the consumer, consumer spending out today. This is the broad measure of consumer spending, not just retail sales. Not just spending on items, on goods. This includes spending on airline tickets, doctors office, and education. A very broad measure. That number was flat. That`s not such a good number. Now of course, we did have two previous months of gains, maybe a lull isn`t surprising.</p><p>We do have wage growth boosting income. That`s the raw material for future spending. Maybe we`ll have a pickup. That is the big question now. One thing I can tell you is inflation is looking very flame in this report as it has in others. It looks like companies still don`t have pricing power. Christine. Because a (INAUDIBLE), if the price is too high, we say no thanks. I don`t want to buy it.</p><p>ROMANS: Right. Absolutely. Ok, now the economy not the first focus of the first presidential debate.</p><p>HAYS: How could they not? How could they go past the economy?</p><p>ROMANS: They`ll get to it. They`ll get to it.</p><p>HAYS: The third debate. Tonight of course, it`s foreign policy and homeland security. But it`s still about money, isn`t it? Worried about the budget deficit. We`re worried about the dollar cost and things. So we just wanted to give you some facts on the figures.</p><p>In the 2005 fiscal year budget, national security, think of the Pentagon, think of troops, think of new planes, all kind of things, that`s $420 billion. The war next year, or this fiscal year I should say is going to cost us $50 billion, at least. Homeland security comes in at $32 billion for a total of $500 billion. And that is about one-fifth, isn`t it, of the total budget of $2.4 trillion. So that does put it in perspective. It also shows really, how important this is.</p><p>Everybody would say whatever it costs. Whatever it costs for homeland security. Whatever it costs to be strong in the world. It is a cost though. And spending that money of course takes money away from other things.</p><p>ROMANS: Jobs also a big on the campaign trail. October 8th is the last jobs report before the election.</p><p>HAYS: Isn`t that interesting? Yes. So this is the last one we`ll get to see. And then I think we get one more GDP report as well. And it will be the first look at third quarter GDP. I think we also get that before-</p><p>ROMANS: Very important.</p><p>HAYS: It will be very important.</p><p>ROMANS: It`s interesting. Because depending on which camp you talk to. You talk to the Kerry camp and they`ll say things like 3.9 million Americans have simply exhausted their unemployment benefits over the last year. So when you talk about unemployment rates, you talk about people getting jobs, keep in mind, there are almost 4 million people who simply ran out of unemployment benefits and can`t find jobs.</p><p>But the Bush administration will say look, the momentum has been good over the past year. So it`s so political --</p><p>HAYS: And we don`t know for sure. I will say though, I think what`s interesting when Dick Cheney says don`t worry, lots of those people are selling things on eBay [Company: eBay Inc.; Ticker: EBAY ; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ebay.com\">http://www.ebay.com</url>/] . I would say, Mr. Cheney though, is that a sign of health that people are making a living by selling stuff on eBay, or a sign that they don`t have anything else to do? Kind of arguing to the Kerry point. But it`s --</p><p>ROMANS: It`s certainly not the best job market in 20 years. It`s not the worst job market in three generations.</p><p>HAYS: That`s right.</p><p>ROMANS: Somewhere in the middle. All right. Thank you very much Kathleen.</p><p>Still ahead on STREETSWEEP, fresh questions about Fannie Mae`s accounting drag its shares to the lowest level in a year. And the next step may be a criminal case.</p><p>Also, Merck gets high marks for the way it`s handling the Vioxx crisis. Can the company recover?</p><p>With a few minutes left until the closing bell, stocks are down. The Dow down 59 points, 10,076.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Violence took a heavy toll in Iraq and in the Middle East. In Iraq, multiple car bombs rocked the capital killing 44 people, most of them children. That makes September the worst month for car bombs to date. More casualties came from a U.S. air strike in Fallujah, and violence near Mosul.</p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that violence is escalating, and said he expects it to get even worse as Iraqi elections approach. One Iraqi official says the county`s security forces are preparing a major offensive against the insurgents.</p><p>A bloody day in Gaza as well, where Israeli soldiers tried to halt a series of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. In one marketplace, civilians were caught in the crossfire. A senior commander for Hamas said Israeli troops must retreat from the battle sites if they want the rocket attacks to stop.</p><p>And residents of Washington State are keeping a wary eye on the Cascades. The area around Mount St. Helens is under a volcano advisory. Geologists say the volcano could erupt in coming days or weeks. Officials say the damage could be minimal or moderate, but note that seismic activity has been rising steadily.</p><p>Back in the markets now. For the third time this week, one of our five for five stock pickers is recommending Pfizer as a stock for the long term. Richard Steinberg says investors should focus on mega large cap stocks. He also has four other picks to share with u this afternoon. We`re looking for five great stocks for the next five years. He joins me now from (INAUDIBLE) Florida.</p><p>Welcome to the program.</p><p>RICHARD STEINBERG, STEINBERG GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hey Christine, good to see you again.</p><p>ROMANS: Let`s talk first about Pfizer. Because what better day for you to come and say you think investors for the long-term should be buying Pfizer. It`s up today. A lot of people are talking about it and its drug Celebrex, because of what`s happening with Vioxx and Merck.</p><p>STEINBERG: Right. Do I have blood here? Because we also own a lot of Merck. I had an anvil fall on my head today.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh man. What are you going to do -- first of all, what are going to do with your Merck shares? Are you going to get out, or are you going to buy more here? Because it`s pretty cheap.</p><p>STEINBERG: We were on the conference call. And if you remember, about a year or so ago, you and I had Ray Gilmartin on your show.</p><p>ROMANS: That`s right.</p><p>STEINBERG: I think for now we`re going to sit tight and let things settle in. And look to just kind of analyze things as they go on. And not panic out of the name. But Pfizer still has a great franchise. They`re going to earn over $2.36 next year. We`re looking for companies that are either number one or number two market share in their markets now.</p><p>They were number one or two. And Celebrex, now there`s only one left really. So I think that that $2.36 could be light. And it could be a lot higher. And I think the pipeline still is very strong for Pfizer. It`s trading at 13 multiple. Good yield. I think that`s also a trend we have to look for, is getting paid to wait.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Let`s talk about General Electric [Company: General Electric Company; Ticker: GE; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ge.com\">http://www.ge.com</url>/] ; It`s also on your list. It`s another name that someone mentioned earlier this week too. So this is a big mega cap name. It`s got exposure to a whole bunch of different businesses, from jet engines, to the media. Why do you like it?</p><p>STEINBERG: Well, if we get back to our five-year theme of having globally diversified businesses, GE is a basically a bet that the long-term global economy continues to grow. They`re going to earn $1.78 this year. The six-sigma approach of getting out of businesses that they shouldn`t be in continues to work well.</p><p>Jeffrey Immelt`s doing an excellent job of kind of reining things in. The yield`s 2-plus percent. And I think it`s a name that over a long-term gives you broad exposure. And a name that of you have a long enough time horizon, like five years, you should own.</p><p>ROMANS: This is a name that also gives you a broad global exposure as well. I mean, I know this is a big player in the global outsourcing business.</p><p>STEINBERG: IBM, absolutely. They`ll going to earn $5.50 next year. Stocks relatively cheap. Cap ex spending and --</p><p>ROMANS: You`re talking about IBM [Company: International Business Machines Corporation; Ticker: IBM; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibm.com\">http://www.ibm.com</url>/] here or GE?</p><p>STEINBERG: Oh, I`m sorry, GE, I`m sorry. GE global outsourcing is still a big deal. But I think it`s more about getting some of the problems out of the way that they have, where they`ve had with power generation and aircrafts.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. You mentioned IBM. Another big tech name. Another very well known blue chip name. In the papers in the news today because of a settlement, a payment, because of the way it sort of switched over some of its retirees pensions. Are you concerned about it?</p><p>STEINBERG: I`m not concerned about the retirees. There`s always kind of complaining when things get changed a bit. But the long-term story with IBM is really more about the -- their ability to have a smoother revenue stream than most tech companies, because of the recurring revenues from consulting and services.</p><p>Citigroup [Company: Citigroup Inc.; Ticker: C; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.citi.com\">http://www.citi.com</url>/] . Sally Krawcheck. What do you think about that move? Some changes over at Citi lately. Are you interested in Citigroup because of the way this management is positioned? Are you interested in it because it`s the biggest player out there? Why do you like it?</p><p>STEINBERG: Global reach in financial services, 10 times earnings, great yield. Obviously, with the change in interest rates that are occurring, I believe that their balance sheet liability exposure is well positioned for a bump up in rates. And again, if I look out five years, and I want global exposure, two names, I think Citigroup has to be a core holding.</p><p>ROMANS: Target [Company: Target Corporation; Ticker: TGT; URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.targetcorp.com\">http://www.targetcorp.com</url>/] is a number two to Wal-Mart [Company: Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; Ticker: WMT ; URL:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wal-mart.com\">http://www.wal-mart.com</url>/] . You know, Wal- Mart seems to gobble up everything every place it goes. It`s the biggest retailer. The biggest everything. How can Target position itself with Wal-Mart sort of as the big you know, gorilla in the field?</p><p>STEINBERG: I think this is the PT boat outmaneuvering the large aircraft carrier right now. Target is going to earn $2.60 this year. They`ve shed Marshall Fields , which was kind of the albatross. And I think that as we go through kind of these pitfalls and ups and downs in the economy, the market will continue to drive towards that discount retailing.</p><p>Wal-Mart is still the 800-pound gorilla, but doesn`t mean the baby gorilla can`t make money along the way. I think in the short run, especially with some of the problems that they have in litigation, and litigation payments that Wal-Mart has, that they`re going to be able to make a lot of money.</p><p>ROMANS: Overall Richard, tell us a little bit about what kinds of criteria you use for picking stocks. Talk to our viewer, the average investor who is looking out for five years trying to build some sort of portfolio.</p><p>STEINBERG: So the first thing that you need to do is you need to know what you own. The second thing is, I think if you focus on large, easy to understand companies, you have a much better ability to have successful performance and not get caught up in the latest technological changes.</p><p>The other thing is you want to focus on companies that can dominate their market share, that have a diversified business model, and have very strong management. You have to be able to distinguish the difference between owning a good company, and owning a good stock.</p><p>If you can bring those pieces together and focus on also getting paid to wait with some dividends where possible, I think, as we go through a transition in the economy over the next five years, we`ll, -- you`ll be successful.</p><p>ROMANS: Richard Steinberg thanks so much for joining us. We`re going to put those stock picks on our web site if anybody missed them.</p><p>Still ahead, President George Bush and Senator John Kerry square off tonight in the first presidential debate. Their subject -- foreign policy.</p><p>Plus, a long-term look at Merck. Vioxx is one problem. But here`s another. Its patent for top-selling Zocor expires in about a year.</p><p>Moments to go to the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average down 71 points.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://WWW.FDCH.COM\">WWW.FDCH.COM</url></p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2004 Cable News Network, Inc.

This is NEWSROOM L.A. Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has just gone on the record about what should happen to the suspect in the New York terror attack: he should get the death penalty. The president tweeted his thoughts a short time ago in caps as you see there, at the bottom. Just one in series of increasingly harsh and controversial reactions to the attack, including this: \"The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher extreme vetting procedures. The safety of our citizens comes first.\"</p><p>VAUSE: We also have a new photo of the suspect taken on the day of the attack. And just hours before police say Sayfullo used a rental pick-up truck to kill eight people on New York bike path. He's now being charged with federal crimes including material support of a terrorist organization -- that would be ISIS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOON KIM, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: We have developed evidence establishing that Saipov committed this attack in support of ISIS. That evidence is laid out in the complaint, but it includes the following: a note that was recovered just outside the truck that read in part, \"no god, but god, and Mohammed is his prophet\", and Islamic supplication, \"it will endure,\" a phrase commonly used to refer to ISIS.</p><p>Also, a search of cell phones found in a bag that he was carrying. A search conducted pursuant to court-authorized wiretaps, revealed thousands of ISIS-related images and 90 videos -- about 90 videos depicting among other things, ISIS fighters killing prisoners by running over them with a tank, beheading them, and shooting them in the face.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Prosecutors allege Sayfullo spent two months planning the attack.</p><p>SESAY: Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's out fires response, he's getting a lot of attention and criticism. He's called <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>Justice System a joke and suggested that Saipov be detained at Guantanamo Bay. But both of those comments have since been overshadowed by his newest suggestion: the death penalty. Our reporters are covering every angle of this story and we're learning even more about Sayfullo Saipov, his planning, and the attack.</p><p>VAUSE: Here's CNN's Miguel Marquez reporting from New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, authorities say, Saipov came up with this plan to attack the United States about a year ago but he settled on this precise plan about two months ago. He also consumed tons of propaganda online in the form of ISIS videos and photographs. But for as long as it took him to plan, as soon as he was ready to carry it out, took about an hour.</p><p>Agents searching the Patterson, New Jersey home of Sayfullo Saipov. Search warrants were served at several locations as authorities begin to dig into the 29-year-old Uzbek's life.</p><p>JOHN MILLER, DEPUTY POLICE COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK: Based on the investigation overnight, it appears that Mr. Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks. He did this in the name of ISIS.</p><p>MARQUEZ: In the rented Home Depot truck turned into an instrument of terror. Authorities found knives along with a note.</p><p>MILLER: The notes were handwritten in Arabic. They had symbols and words. But the gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Neighbors say Saipov was seen driving a rented Home Depot truck for weeks and never appeared to be doing any work, just driving.</p><p>CARLOS BAUTISTA, NEIGHBOR OF SAYFULLO SAIPOV: First time I saw him was three weeks ago and I guess he constantly rented the same model truck out.</p><p>MARQUEZ: The federal charging document says he rented the vehicle to practice making turns. It says, he chose Halloween because he believed more people would be on the street. He was inspired by ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. For all the planning, the attack didn't take long. Authorities say he rented the truck at a Home Depot in Passaic, New Jersey at 2:06 p.m., he crossed into Manhattan at 2:43 via the George Washington Bridge. 21 minutes later, at 3:04 p.m., he entered into the bicycle path and started his killing spree. Four minutes later, dozens of 911 calls flooded into police dispatch.</p><p>[01:05:19] MILLER: He appears to have followed almost exactly to a tee -- the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels before with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Accounts from neighbors of Saipov vary. Some say, he was polite, unconfrontational, and even at times a peacemaker. An acquaintance in Ohio saying he was a nervous man, even aggressive, but saw no signs of radicalization.</p><p>Now, authorities also say that Mr. Saipov was not on any terror watch list. He was also not the focus of any NYPD or FBI investigation. But he may have been associated with those who were under investigation by either NYPD and/or the FBI. Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Miguel, thank you for that. With us now, CNN National Security Analyst Nada Bakos, and Brian Levin, the Director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Nada, first to you, we've got a lot more details now coming to light about Saipov, and, you know, how he practiced this attack. He carried it out for two months. He'd been on Web sites with the ISIS-related material. He had thousands of photographs of violent imagery, 90 videos as well. Is there a way to back channel and to find out where those images came from to find out who may have recruited him or how he may have been radicalized?</p><p>NADA BAKOS, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via Skype): You know, right now investigators have a hold of, I think, at least two cell phones of his. That will be a treasure trove for them; they'll be able to identify where the jpegs came from, where the videos came from, whether he scraped them from online, whether they were sent to him. If the details are on the phone they should be able to find it. But they'll also be able to use information that he's giving them to verify -- information they're receiving from the phone in addition to any other contacts they're talking to now.</p><p>SESAY: And Brian, to you. As we understand it right now, the radicalization took place online with exposure to these images, these videos. And one would think this amount or this level of intensity, exposure to this level of intensity and depravity, that it would bring about a change in him, an outward sign of the change in him. I mean, wouldn't you expect that those around him would have picked up on what was happening?</p><p>BRIAN LEVIN, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM: You know, yes. In about 30 percent to 40 percent of these cases, researchers have found there's something called leakage, either behavioral or oral clue, that there's some plan. Sometimes, folks, just become more withdrawn. That's what we saw with respect to the attack that we had in San Bernardino. But a lot of times what we're finding now is that more recently people are becoming radicalized in a much shorter time frame. It used to be a year or more, now it's in months. And that folks are becoming much more secretive in the manner that they become radicalized.</p><p>SESAY: Why is it taking less sometime?</p><p>LEVIN: I think a couple things. One, propaganda of the deed, if you will. People are seeing these kinds of attacks and want to outdo the last person. And we see this more broadly with respect to extremism. Look at Columbine. And we just saw, for instance, the Sandy Hook killer, kept records about different mass killers. And it's very similar with respect to groups like ISIS where this kind of celebritization of these terrible kinds of terror attacks are part of the propaganda. And what it says is, you don't even have to come here to be in the theater to get trained, you can do things on your own, here's why, here are the terrible things the west is doing, and here are the instrumentalities that you can do in your own community.</p><p>VAUSE: And that he may have been radicalized online and by himself, but we also have word that a second person is being questioned by police. They put out the wanted posters and 90 minutes later they managed to get a hold of this. So, another young man or 32-year-old man from Uzbekistan. Given that they were so keen, obviously, to get him by going public and 24 hours after the attack, how do you think he fits into all of this?</p><p>BAKOS: It's hard to tell at this point. It could just be somebody that he was a roommate with, somebody he had worked with. Law enforcement may have received information about him on the phone. It's hard to tell at this point who his other contacts were. But I do think one of the things the law enforcement is doing at this point is drawing those concentric circles around the suspect, trying to figure out who is closest to him, and then follow the chain of evidence from there, so they can figure out whether or not he had contacts overseas, if the radicalization truly did happen here in the United States as they had talked about. So, at this point, anybody they can talk to that knew this individual prior to the attack will actually help them fill in those pieces.</p><p>[01:10:26] SESAY: Brian, back to the issue of the radicalization, if this man came here seven years ago in 2010, by winning the lottery, right? He came here for a better life, he wants to be part of this culture; he was here for seven years. And then, he allegedly performs this act of mass killing. Why would someone who has taken that path to get here still be susceptible to the message from the likes of ISIS? I mean, he's come here for a better life. Why is he not immune to it, if you will? The kind of message that ISIS is putting out. Because he's been in America for seven years; he's been living here for seven years; he's made friends; he's in the community. Why?</p><p>LEVIN: Great question. And maybe what happened is his moving here did not meet his expectations. One of the things that we look at in the template that we have is there were three types of factors. One, the ideologically motivated -- can be religious, political or both. Two, someone who's psychologically dangerous. Three, personal benefit or revenge or some mix thereof. And what might have happened if he came here for a better life, might have been disappointed. Maybe he did not achieve what he hoped he would achieve. And at the same time, once someone opts out, they do not feel connected to the community that they thought they would be, then it's a lot easier for this radicalization process to take place.</p><p>VAUSE: There are some reports out there he had some financial difficulties as well. So, you know, maybe that's --</p><p>LEVIN: Personal setbacks. Absolutely.</p><p>VAUSE: And lastly to Nada, you know, we heard from Miguel Marquez reporting that Saipov was not on a terror watch list, despite going to these Web sites that contained ISIS-related materials, despite having all these images on his cell phone. Are you surprised that he was under the radar here?</p><p>BAKOS: I'm not surprised. Just visiting some of these Web sites isn't a crime, even the process of radicalization is not committing a crime. It's the time period from being radicalized of deciding to act on that -- to actually conduct an attack. There's -- thankfully, you know, the first amendment, we have freedom of speech and perceptions in the United States. But at the same time, individuals like him can easily go under the radar, especially if he wasn't connected to somebody overseas or other people that law enforcement was familiar with.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Nada, good to see you. Thank you so much for being with us. And also, Brian, we appreciate your insights. Thanks for being here as well.</p><p>LEVIN: Thank you as always.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you. Well, we're learning more about the officer who shot the terror suspect. On Wednesday, the prosecutor explained how Ryan Nash's quick actions saved lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM: He was ultimately stopped by a brave Police Officer, Ryan Nash, who confronted him and shot him in the abdomen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Ryan Nash says he's just doing his job and he actually praised his fellow officers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN NASH, POLICE OFFICER, NYPD: I appreciate the public recognition of the actions of myself and my fellow officers yesterday. Although I feel we were just doing our job like thousands of officers do every day, I understand the importance of yesterday's events and the role we played and I'm grateful for the recognition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: Well, officer Nash has been with the NYPD for just five years. Well, coming up after the break, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>responds to Tuesday's terror attack in New York by tweeting his opinion about the suspect's guilt and the punishment he should receive.</p><p>SESAY: Plus, Director and Producer, Brett Ratner, is the latest Hollywood figure accused of sexual misconduct. Victims' Rights Attorney Gloria Allred joins us later in this hour to weigh in.</p><p>[01:16:15] VAUSE: Well, the <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>president has had a busy day on Twitter, demanding stronger vetting for immigrants and blaming Democrats for being weak on immigration.</p><p>SESAY: And then, he tweeted this: \"NYC terrorist is happy as he is to hang ISIS flag in a hospital room. He killed eight people, badly injured 12. Should get death penalty.\" For more on the president's reaction to the attack, here's CNN's Jim Acosta.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: New York City --</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Less than one day after the terror attack in New York, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>described the <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>Justice System, a cornerstone of American democracy, as a farce.</p><p>TRUMP: We also he to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now. They'll go through court for years, at the end they'll be -- who knows what happens. We need quick justice and we need strong justice, much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now us a joke and is a laughingstock, and no wonder so much of this stuff takes place.</p><p>ACOSTA: Questioned about that, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders asked the public to ignore the words coming out of the president's mouth.</p><p>Why did the president call the <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>Justice System a joke and a laughingstock during his comments?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That's not what he said.</p><p>ACOSTA: He said that the system of justice in this country -</p><p>SANDERS: He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.</p><p>ACOSTA: Noting the Manhattan attack suspect came to the <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>from Uzbekistan, the president also called for swift changes to the nation's immigration laws.</p><p>TRUMP: So, we want to immediately work with Congress on the diversity lottery program on terminating it, getting rid of it. We want a merit-based program where people come into our country based on merit. And we want to get rid of chain migration. This man that came in, or whatever you want to call him, brought in with him other people. And he was a point -- he was the point of contact, the primary point of contact for -- and this is preliminary. 23 people that came in or potentially came in with him.</p><p>ACOSTA: Administration officials say the suspect in New York entered the country using that diversity lottery immigration system seven years ago. The president was seizing on the program earlier in the day, dubbing it on Twitter as a Chuck Schumer beauty: \"I want merit- based.\" Mr. Trump neglected to mention the program was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. And while Senator Schumer supported the program, he later tried to eliminate it, so says GOP Senator Jeff Flake, who tweeted: \"Actually, the gang of eight including Senator Schumer did away with the diversity visa program as part of broader reforms. I know. I was there.\"</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER: The president ought to stop tweeting and start leading.</p><p>ACOSTA: Schumer said, the president would be better off emulating former President George W. Bush.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUSH: -- and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>ACOSTA: Who rallied the <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>shortly after the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>SCHUMER: New Yorkers and all of us compare President Bush right after 9/11, and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>right after this horrible terrorist attack. President Bush united us. He had us in the White House the next day, saying how can we work together. All <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>does is take advantage, horrible advantage, of a tragedy and try to politicize and divide.</p><p>[01:20:07] ACOSTA: The president's swift demands for new laws after this week's attack in New York stand in contrast with his reaction after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, where he suggested the public wait to talk about gun control.</p><p>TRUMP: Look, we have a tragedy. We're going to do -- and what happened, in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job. And we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.</p><p>ACOSTA: the president said he would consider sending the terror suspect in New York to the detention center at Guantanamo. He also speculated that the suspect's relatives may pose a national security threat. But like so many other assertions from the president, he did not offer any information to back that up. Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Joining us now, Democratic Strategist Matthew Littman, and Republican Strategist Christopher Metzler. Thank you, guys. OK. Let's just pick up where Jim left off in his report. On sending the attacker to Gitmo, declaring him an enemy combatant and having him stand trial in a military court. Here's what Brigadier General John Baker, Chief Defense Counsel for the Military Commission, said recently about those military trials: \"The military commissions in their current state are a farce. Instead of being a beacon for the rule of law, the Guantanamo Bay Military Commissions have been characterized by delay, government misconduct, and incompetence, and even more delay.\"</p><p>Christopher, should the president actually listen to his generals on issues like this even before he goes out and says he's supporting it or he's thinking about it or whatever he said today?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER METZLER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes. So, one of the courses that I teach is the law of war. And so, first of all, the president does not have the authority to send someone to Gitmo. So, there's that. But, you know, facts are very --</p><p>VAUSE: Detailed. Detailed.</p><p>METZLER: Yes. But I think he does -- look, as it relates to Gitmo, I think that, in fact, the American Justice System is doing the job that it is supposed to do. So again, we get back to more pandering. And that's the issue here. Needs to -- he supposedly listens to the generals but only when they agree with him.</p><p>SESAY: I think it's worth putting up on screen, a graphic that we've made that kind of sums up the difference in terms of the rhetoric between the president, what he said regarding Vegas and what he said regarding New York. I mean, if you take look at that, when it happened October 1st in Vegas, it took him, you know, a day or two before he came out on October 3rd, and he said, you know, <person><nameText>U.S. </nameText></person>will be talking about gun laws as time goes by. October 4th, on gun legislation, not going to talk about it, that day. October 5th, on bump stocks we'll be looking into that. You know, temperance, wait, let's see. And then, look at the response to New York: I just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already extreme vetting program. Chain migration must end now. And then Guantanamo and then death penalty. Matt?</p><p>MATTHEW LITTMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, there's a reason -- there is another reason why he says the things he said after Vegas and after New York City. First of all, if you want to do anything about gun laws, it's difficult, right? And so, it's easy for him to come out and say we're going to do something about immigration law that he may not even be able to do. Gun laws would require actual legislating. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>hasn't been able to get anything through Congress -- that's too difficult for him. He also doesn't want to offend what's left of his base by talking about any form of gun control. And in that case, how many people were shot in Vegas? I think --</p><p>VAUSE: 58.</p><p>LITTMAN: Shot in Vegas.</p><p>VAUSE: Oh, shot it was 600.</p><p>SESAY: Yes, 600.</p><p>LITTMAN: 600 people. And there were no ideas after Vegas. I think that was a month ago today. There are no ideas after Vegas.</p><p>VAUSE: The bump-stock legislation which turns a semi-automatic into an automatic is stalled in Congress. It's gone. So, to your point.</p><p>LITTMAN: Yes. No. So, I mean, after Vegas, nothing. Hundreds of people shot. This event happens, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>immediately comes out with what sounds simple to him but things that he'll never be able to do probably anyway.</p><p>VAUSE: The president also had some very strong words for the person accused of carrying out this attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: My administration is coordinating closely between federal and local officials to investigate the attack and to further investigate this animal, who did the attacking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: In the past, Trump has referred to members of his part a gang as animals but nothing close to that to describe the Vegas shooter or the White Nationalists in Charlottesville back in August, in particular, the one who use a car to kill a protester. Christopher, again, it seems pretty obvious, but, you know, what's going on here? I mean, because it's starting to become incredibly obvious where the president stands, right?</p><p>METZLER: Well, I mean, what the president is doing, in this case, is back to Lee Atwater politics. This is the politics of race. It is the politics of other. It is all of those kinds of politics. It didn't work for the Republican Party before, and it's not going to work for the party now. But in his mind and from his standpoint, that is the way to get his base to support him, because at the end of the day a lot of the base who supports him, at some point is going to say, OK, wait a minute, I have lost health care, I don't have all these jobs that are supposed to come back. So, at this point, he wants to make sure that he has this base that whatever he does will support him and turn against Congress so that what ends up happening is you have -- it doesn't translate. Everyone's -- you know, his base is going to blame Congress; they're not going to blame him. So, it's very convenient for him to do it. [01:25:41] SESAY: Yes. But the longer-term repercussions of even floating the idea of sending someone to Gitmo are dangerous. You know, if indeed your intention is to win this war against, you know, these groups.</p><p>METZLER: Absolutely. I mean, going to Gitmo does really nothing. I mean, the American courts are perfectly set up to be able to handle this. But to say --</p><p>LITTMAN: Not according to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He says the American Justice System is a joke, right?</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>LITTMAN: And then Sarah Sanders, you showed the clip, comes out and says that what he said he didn't say. That happens right afterward.</p><p>VAUSE: What were the words going on here, because you got <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>budget as well. I want to get to this because The Washington Post reported back in March: \"The New York City Police Department says that <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>proposed budget which includes sweeping cuts across the government would gut critical efforts to fight terrorism in the nation's largest city. Police say the funding cuts would hit everything from intelligence analysis to active shooter training.\" So, you know, Matt, it's not just what he's saying which is fanciful, he can't get it through Congress, whatever. You know this is a butcher which is about to be passed.</p><p>LITTMAN: Well, this is an important point. I'm not sure that the tax cuts that the president wants to do are going to get passed. But if they do get passed, at some point those are really corporate tax cuts. This is a tax plan written by a couple people from Goldman Sachs on the back of a napkin in a restaurant -- literally, that's what happened. And so, for these people to get their tax cuts and the budget deficit then ballooning, other parts of the government are going to get cut. Everything else is going to get cut because most of the government's money goes to defend Social Security and Medicare, and everything else gets slashed. Including money from our local police forces that are supposed to fight terrorism.</p><p>VAUSE: And it's not just New York; it's across the country.</p><p>SESAY: No, indeed. And very quickly, Ryan Greer, a Counterterror Expert, you know, said this to CNN, he said that this administration has a narrow foot -- had to focus on a narrow set of threats. So, again, they're cutting, and they're cutting money that should go to domestic terrorism to fighting that but the president doesn't want to talk about that.</p><p>LITTMAN: Well, the FBI has said that domestic terrorism is a bigger problem right now than terrorism coming from outside the United States.</p><p>SESAY: But that money is getting cut too.</p><p>LITTMAN: And that money is getting cut. METZLER: Yes. but I think -- so from the president's standpoint, here's the issue. The issue is let's put all of these things up. Let's have all of this kind of confusion going on. That's not what we need to be paying attention to. What we need to be paying attention to is what he's actually doing when we're not looking. So, it's easier to pay attention to the tweets; it's easier to be able to do that. But then, at the end of the day what is he doing through executive orders, through agency regulations? Because I think what people are going to end up finding out is that a lot of what he's doing is not something that people were aware of, to begin with.</p><p>LITTMAN: You don't think that people signed on to the idea of making it easier for mentally handicapped people to get guns or to put, for example -- I know when I drink this water over here, I think there's not enough coal in that water. And how he's -- regulations that there could be more coal in the water. Well, I think that's great.</p><p>VAUSE: They say you should watch this administration like a silent movie.</p><p>LITTMAN: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Matt and Christopher, thank you so much.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you. We so much appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>METZLER: Pleasure.</p><p>LITTMAN: Take care.</p><p>[01:28:47] VAUSE: OK. Next here on NEWSROOM L.A., we've seen nearly a dozen vehicle attacks in the past three years, all hitting soft targets. How to make us all a little safer, in just a moment.</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back, everybody. The terror suspect in New York is facing several terrorism charges tied to Tuesday's truck attack. Investigators have charged Sayfullo Saipov with providing material support to ISIS, and violence, and destruction of a motor vehicle.</p><p>SESAY: And Saipov didn't enter a plea when he appeared in court Wednesday. CNN Shimon Prokupecz has more on the evidence collected in this case so far.</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: John and Isha, authorities released a document today, criminal complaint filed in federal court that listed all the different investigative findings. They have found two cell phones belonging to the suspect. On one of the phones they found 90 videos related to ISIS propaganda, videos that they believe he watched.</p><p>One of the videos showed a beheading. They also found on one of the phones some 3,800 ISIS propaganda images. Now authorities, based on their interviews with the suspect which they had spent some time with him at the hospital after the incident and they interviewed him, and he told them this for over a year. And then, the last two months, he decided to use a truck.</p><p>They also found that he researched using a truck, where he could purchase one. Also researching Halloween. And they believe he chose Halloween because he wanted the biggest impact, an attack that would kill the most people. Back to you.</p><p>SESAY: Shimon, thank you for that. Well, there's been an uptick in the number of attacks using weaponized vehicles. Ten such attacks had happened since 2014, with more than half this year alone. The common denominator here is that they all hit soft targets.</p><p>Now, when we say soft targets we're talking about places like streets or shopping centers that are relatively unprotected.</p><p>VAUSE: And the deadliest attack of all happened in the South of France last year where a truck barreled into a crowd that were out celebrating Bastille Day on Promenade in Nice. Eighty-six people were killed. Rob Ritter joins us now. He is a pedestrian safety expert.</p><p>Rob, thanks for coming in. There's always this Pavlovian response when there's an attack like this wherever it is around the world. You're -- we need greater security, you've got to put up barricades, put up bollards in the -- in -- where the attack happened. But it seems like it's kind of bando strategy, isn't it?</p><p>ROB RITTER, PEDESTRIAN SAFETY EXPERT: Oh, very much so. And the -- as you say, it's the Pavlovian response of, we need more security, we need more security. That isn't necessarily the case.</p><p>SESAY: Yes. Let's talk specifically about what happened in New York. You've taken a look at the route that this guy took. What do you see when you look at it in terms of the gaps to be exploited?</p><p>RITTER: Well, the interesting thing is if you look at it from the driver's windshield, when he pulls up to the top of the -- of the -- of the bikeway there's a yellow plastic reflector that says basically please don't come in here. And then he drives for a whole mile and sees nothing. And then at the end, there's another plastic reflector that says basically, \"Please don't come in here.\"</p><p>There was no barrier from the time he got in until the time he got out. And that's just not good planning from a safety standpoint, much less a security standpoint.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, it's interesting because \"The New York Times\" has reported that about 10 years ago another pedestrian was killed on this bike path. He was a drunk driver. And it happened pretty much in the same location as Tuesday's attack.</p><p>And this is part of the recording, despite calls to improve safety on the path since that time recommended steps were not taken. In particular, bollards, metal poles that would block vehicles from accessing the path. They were not installed at most of the access points where cars can turn onto the path.</p><p>I guess the point here is terrorism maybe isn't preventable but you could prevent people from driving on that bike path.</p><p>RITTER: Well, I think that as you said, the Pavlovian response is more security. Really safety is very simple and safety is improving security. Whether you're going to perfectly secured or not, you're not necessarily defending the president on a bike path. You're just making sure people are safe.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. So with that in mind, what are some of the measures you could be looking at?</p><p>[01:35:02] RITTER: Well, the simplest way to have done that would be to put some removable or retractable bollards or something at both ends. And you certainly don't want anybody to be able to go a whole mile for crying out loud, so you put in some sort of a barrier that a vehicle would have to stop and negotiate some form of removing a barrier or something like that. Because it's just crazy to think somebody could drive a whole mile and hit however many people there are in -- are in a mile.</p><p>So if you -- even if you broke that up into five sections there's no way he's going to get to all five sections.</p><p>SESAY: The question has to be when does it become too much when have you gone too far in the pursuit of safety?</p><p>RITTER: And I know, but, you know, I don't know about you. I drive a car. It seats five people. I have eight airbags. I have ten cup holders.</p><p>Why everybody needs two cup holders? I don't know. But at the end of the day the -- it's all about the safety. And I don't have a secure vehicle, I have a safe vehicle. And a bike path like that there's no reason to make it a completely secured site.</p><p>You're not going to keep, you know, members of Congress working there or anything. But just simple safety keeps drunks away. It keeps bad people away. No terrorist is going to hit a hardened target because then he can't proceed to do the next thing.</p><p>If you take care of safety you've probably taken care of the security.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, we keep hearing these calls from politicians including the New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying everyone needs to return to their daily lives, just go about your business as usual. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: We have hardened society from a policing point of view, protection, et cetera. I think it's defiance. I said all yesterday afternoon I'll see you at the parade, I'll see you at the parade, I'll see you at the parade.</p><p>You can't let them win. The only -- the only way forward is to defeat them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, (INAUDIBLE) and, you know, it's good to actually return to normal as quickly as possible. But you do need to change your behavior. There's something called situational awareness which people should actually keep in mind right now, now that these car attacks are happening in Europe and now here in United States, right?</p><p>There are simple things that you can do to be aware of what's going on.</p><p>RITTER: Yes. Bear in mind it's difficult to do when vehicle's coming behind you at 40 miles an hour and you're oblivious to it. But, you know, you're at risk if you sit at a -- at a coffee shop with a -- at a table and chairs right on the sidewalk with the cars pulling up right in front of you.</p><p>Situational awareness is basic common sense. To ask tourists who maybe are not, you know, they're busy seeing New York for the first time, they're probably not going to be as situationally aware. That's why New York when did Times Square Plaza just took the awareness out of it, they just protected it completely.</p><p>So then when the car did come down the street and was stopped by those bollards it was -- no one had to react at all because they were separated and protected. On a bike path you want to be leisurely and do all the things you do on a bike path, but you need to be able to keep cars from coming behind you at 40 miles an hour or pickup trucks.</p><p>SESAY: And bear in mind, you know, we live in a world where there are numerous soft targets if you will, everywhere, what's the priority list? Because at the end of the day resources are fine knives.</p><p>RITTER: Well, of course, but that's why I say if we try to do everything in a secure fashion we'll run out of money very quickly. If we try to make things safer, we do much better as -- I mean, they could've protected bike path for about $8,000 on each end. And in the City of New York, $16,000 is not a major budget item.</p><p>VAUSE: Two thousand per victim.</p><p>RITTER: I'm sorry?</p><p>VAUSE: It's $2,000 per victim basically is what you're saying, so.</p><p>RITTER: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: Exactly.</p><p>SESAY: Yes. Oh, we appreciate you, thank you, putting a lot in perspective and giving us lots to think about. Thank you.</p><p>RITTER: Nice to be with you guys again.</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks for coming in.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you. RITTER: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: All right. Quick break here, next on NEWSROOM L.A. it's only been a few weeks since sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein exploded into public viewers. I should say, Weinstein.</p><p>And since then new allegations have been made against other powerful men and it's happening nearly every day. We'll discuss with victims' rights attorney Gloria Allred. Next.</p><p>[01:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, sexual harassment scandals threatening to engulf the British parliament has now reached the highest levels of government. Defense Chief Michael Fallon has resigned amidst allegations of inappropriate behavior. Fallon was a key member of Theresa May's cabinet.</p><p>In a letter of resignation, he said his conduct in the past may have fallen short of high standards expected by the UK military. But he also said some accusations against him are in fact false. Early this week Fallon apologized for repeatedly touching a journalist's knee 15 years ago.</p><p>SESAY: Well, Director and Producer Brett Ratner whose films include the Oscar winner \"The Revenant\" is the latest Hollywood figure accused of sexual misconduct. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reports six women including actresses Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge accused Ratner of allegations ranging from sexual assault to harassment. He has denied the allegations.</p><p>And the floodgates really opened in Hollywood last month when more than 60 women came forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by film producer Harvey Weinstein over a period of decades. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Other high- profile men from various walks of life have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct too since Weinstein's story unfolded.</p><p>Attorney Gloria Allred represents some of these accusers. She is a long-time victims' rights advocate. And I'm pleased to say she joins us in the studio now. Gloria, thank you. Thank you for being with us.</p><p>GLORIA ALLRED, VICTIMS' RIGHTS ATTORNEY: My pleasure.</p><p>SESAY: Let's start with the situation regarding Brett Ratner, the latest in this long line of powerful men to basically have the light shone on the -- what they allegedly had done. Someone like Asia Argento who has claimed that she was a victim at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, she put out a tweet a short time ago and she said in reference to Brett Ratner, \"This article is what we've all been waiting for. @Brettratner, you have been bleep busted.\"</p><p>Are you surprised some people are calling this an open secret?</p><p>ALLRED: Well, all I'll say as a lawyer is that I'm generally aware of allegations against many rich powerful famous men in Hollywood and elsewhere before they become public. And I'm just talking in general.</p><p>SESAY: Sure, so sure.</p><p>ALLRED: So generally, I'm not surprised. And there are women speaking out. Of course, it's very dangerous for them and I want everybody to know them -- that. For example, Mr. Ratner has now filed a lawsuit against apparently the first woman who went on the internet and made allegations against him.</p><p>And so she will now, once she's served, have to defend against the lawsuit. And then there may be others -- other lawsuits coming against other women. That doesn't mean they won't prevail.</p><p>Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. But they'll have to hire lawyers to defend them which can be very expensive and time-consuming. So all I can say is definitely consult a lawyer before you go on the internet and make allegations because even if what you're saying is true you may have to defend that in a court of law.</p><p>SESAY: And what is interesting in the Brett Ratner situation is how quickly it gained steam, how quickly the fallout, if you will, spread. I mean, obviously there was a public reaction and then there was a situation regarding his career in Warner Bros. So when CNN reached out to Warner Bros just after the \"L.A. Times\" story, this is what we got.</p><p>We just got a \"We are aware of the allegations in \"The L.A. Times\" and are reviewing the situation.\" Hours later Brett Ratner comes out and says, \"In light of the allegations being made I'm choosing to personally step away from all Warner Bros-related activities. I don't want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved.\"</p><p>Has Hollywood finally gotten the message that when these things happen you've got to take them seriously, you've got to stand aside?</p><p>ALLRED: Well, allegations are spreading like wildfire and because many women feel empowered and they don't want to be silent anymore about what they believe. They have suffered as injustice is inflicted on them in their employment, which has really seriously financially damaged them. So, you know, they're saying their truth right now.</p><p>[01:45:02] SESAY: Yes.</p><p>ALLRED: But the men are also feeling very serious economic consequences from the allegations. I mean, now we see so many men, you know, the allegations against Kevin Spacey, allegations against Brett Ratner. I am literally flooded with Harvey Weinstein, I represent numerous clients, there will be lawsuits very soon.</p><p>And I'm receiving emails and calls from persons who alleged they are victims who are all over the world, in different countries.</p><p>SESAY: (INAUDIBLE) when you did an interview with one of the -- one of -- with the (INAUDIBLE) and at that point, you know, there were just 25 accuses and you said this is just the tip of the iceberg. ALLRED: It is.</p><p>SESAY: And now it's over 60. I mean, you have been doing this for a long time, but is there any part of you surprised, I mean, more than 60 calls still coming in?</p><p>ALLRED: Well, when you say more than 60, those are 60 who have gone in public. I'm talking about numerous women and I've got public with four at news conferences. But many more than that that I'm representing who have not go in public, many of whom don't wish to be public and will never be public because if we file a lawsuit we'll also file them Jane Does.</p><p>SESAY: Yes.</p><p>ALLRED: And so yes, there are many, many more than 60, I can assure you of that.</p><p>SESAY: This is the moment -- as we've just reference with Brett Ratner within hours stepping away from Warner Bros, this is the moment where people have to take stalk. You have obviously been waiting for this moment for a long time, what do you want to see come off it? What should be the legacy of this moment?</p><p>ALLRED: Justice. Justice for a person who can prove that they are victims and that's important. But I think that every woman who feels that she has been a victim of injustice, and by the way, some men are coming forward --</p><p>SESAY: As well.</p><p>ALLRED: -- as well, I'm not talking necessarily about Harvey Weinstein, alleging that they have been victims of powerful men in Hollywood as well. I would suggest that everyone make sure that you speak with an attorney, a sexual harassment attorney, a civil right attorney to make -- to know what your rights are so that you can judge whether you have a legal claim you can assert a lawsuit, whether you can have a confidential settlement, whether you should speak out on the internet even if it's too late for you to file a claim.</p><p>SESAY: Yes.</p><p>ALLRED: Get advice and then make it a foreign decision. But know that you can speak confidentially to an attorney and you don't have to worry about that becoming public.</p><p>SESAY: Before I let you go I got to ask you. I know you've talked about the Weinstein company setting up victims fund.</p><p>ALLRED: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: You, of course, been having conversation with them, where is that?</p><p>ALLRED: I have not had a meeting with the board yet but there are some interesting developments and well -- SESAY: Are you going to share any of the developments to me?</p><p>ALLRED: I have no comment on what those developments are tonight but I can assure you that we are on the path to justice for victims and we are going to continue to be on that path until we're able to obtain that justice. We think that it's important that Mr. Weinstein is getting sexual addiction therapy or if he's left, if he's still in contact with his doctor. All that as well, all that is good.</p><p>Anybody who needs help should get it, but we're focused on the persons who can prove that they are victims. And a woman's word, by the way, is also evidence. They shouldn't say, \"Well, I have no evidence.\"</p><p>Their word matters, and are going to continue to represent them and to seek justice for them and I'll make a guess that you're going to hear something soon.</p><p>SESAY: I'll make a guess I'll get you back on the show.</p><p>ALLRED: OK. Thank you.</p><p>SESAY: Gloria Allred, our pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>ALLRED: Thank you.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Terror and tech has been the new frontier for recruiting and radicalizing. But when we come back, one entrepreneur said he can win over the potentially vulnerable young men with his own technique.</p><p>[01:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SESAY: And we have some news just coming into us. Police are searching for a killer in Denver, Colorado after three people died in a shooting at a Walmart store. It happened in the town of Thornton late Wednesday. Police say the man walked into the store and began shooting.</p><p>Authorities say two male victims died at the scene and a woman who was wounded died later in hospital. Police tweeted photographs of a man in a vehicle they say are of interest in the shooting. We're going to update you on the story as we get more information coming into us.</p><p>And we're seeing how internet technology played a key role in the New York terror attack. The suspect Sayfullo Saipov had at least two cell phones that held thousands of ISIS images and about 90 videos depicting ISIS fighters. Saipov admitted to being inspired by the videos.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, the Paris attacks two years ago led police on a manhunt to Belgium. The spotlight fell on the town of Molenbeek. A local entrepreneur hated seeing it labeled Jihadi central. He said now he's offering this solution to young people, a different opportunity with technology. Sam Burke has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was a night that's painfully hard to forget. Terror on the streets of Paris. A series of attacks across the city of lights. The most gruesome, the massacre at the Bataclan Theater when 90 people lost their lives.</p><p>The manhunt led investigators to the Brussel suburb of Molenbeek between the tree-lined streets and low-rise apartments, three of the Paris attackers lived here.</p><p>IBRAHIM OUASSARI, MOLENBEEK ENTREPRENEUR: I never think these people of my area can do something like that. Never. So I start some reflection.</p><p>BURKE: Ibrahim Ouassari was born in Molenbeek to Moroccan parents. He knows how much of a struggle it is economically for young people in this area. So he decided to teach what he knows how to do best, coding. Opening a community center called MolenGeek.</p><p>There's just one requirement he looks for in applicants.</p><p>OUASSARI: We don't need people with a lot of skills. We need people want to share, want to be real part of this community. They want to learn, want to change something in their life.</p><p>BURKE: There's nothing old school about the lessons taught here. All the instruction is done in small groups and in one-on-one training. When Belgium's Vice Prime Minister heard about the program, he immediately asked Ibrahim to come to his office. A week after their meeting the Belgian government began supporting MolenGeek.</p><p>ALEXANDER DE CROO, BELGIUM VICE PRIME MINISTER: This is someone who has grown up himself in Molenbeek, who -- that's -- those young kids really look up to him and see him as an example, really as a role model.</p><p>BURKE: What are the measures of success for MolenGeek? How do you know that it's working? Is it working?</p><p>DE CROO: One of the measures is just to see how many people are part of that -- of that community. And we have seen that month after month more people are coming there.</p><p>BURKE: They've had to even turn down people who want to join the program.</p><p>DE CROO: Exactly. So that shows that there's definitely an attraction to what they're -- they are doing. We see that there's projects that are being brought outside as well and that are starting to try to be -- to be businesses.</p><p>BURKE: Has anybody gone on and created their own app, their own company?</p><p>OUASSARI: QuickLyric is an application downloaded more than half million times.</p><p>BURKE: And what do the app do?</p><p>OUASSARI: It give you the lyric of the music.</p><p>BURKE: Money hasn't just come in from the government. Big tech companies like Google had helped fund the school. A Samsung executive who's overseen that company's investment in MolenGeek, says what's key for them is to actually remain hands off.</p><p>LUKAS SCHMEINK, VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS, SAMSUNG: We enter this strongly from a corporate social responsibility perspective. And that perspective we stay loyal. And so -- otherwise, you're starting moving around and then -- and then it becomes blurry what you came to do here.</p><p>BURKE: Ibrahim was even asked to speak at the U.N. where he shared best practices for public-private partnerships. His biggest problem now isn't getting neighbors to finish the program. He faces the biggest hurdle any successful startup does.</p><p>OUASSARI: Scale up and to have more support because we have a lot of requests and --</p><p>BURKE: And there's so much demand.</p><p>OUASSARI: Yes, we have a -- so much demand.</p><p>BURKE: Now he's looking for ways to replicate his neighborhood coding school around the world. The only regret? That it couldn't have been done sooner. Samuel Burke, CNN, Molenbeek, Belgium.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: And thank you for watching this hour of NEWSROOM L.A. we'll have a lot more news after a short break.</p><p>SESAY: Prepare to look at the victims of the New York City terror attack. Here's Anderson Cooper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:55:01] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: It was a reunion of old friends who'd attended the same polytechnic high school in Argentina. They were celebrating their 30th reunion with a trip to New York City and a bike ride along the Hudson River. \"That's it, champion,\" one of the men exclaims.</p><p>They're biking along the same path as Tuesday's tragedy, a few miles north of where the attack happened. The man believed to be filming this, Ariel Benvenuto, would survive. Five of his friends did not.</p><p>In this photo taken before they boarded their plane to America the Argentinean victims are pictured standing arm in arm with their classmates. \"Libre\" printed on their t-shirts Spanish for free. Hernan Ferruchi, Alejandro Padnucco, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Mendoza, and Diego Angelini were all killed. Nicholas Cleve was the only native New Yorker to have died in Tuesday's attack. According to social media accounts, he attended Elisabeth Irwin High School in lower Manhattan before heading to Skidmore College Upstate. He just graduated last year with a degree in computer science and just returned to New York City to start a job as a software engineer.</p><p>His life was just getting started. Nicholas Cleves was 23-year-old. Darren Drake was the other American killed in the attack. The 32- year-old project manager worked at 7 World Trade Center. He was on a bike ride in between meetings when he was hit by the truck, according to his father who described him as the perfect son.</p><p>JIMMY DRAKE, FATHER OF VICTIM: I'm not even angry. I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not angry at all. I'm absolutely hurt.</p><p>COOPER: Drake was from nearby New Milford, New Jersey. He graduated from Rutgers in 2007 with a degree in political science, then went on for a master's in business administration from Fairleigh Dickinson University. He was well on his way to his second master's in science when he was killed.</p><p>Drake had also served as his local school board president. The superintendent of the district called his death senseless, saying \"Darren was a good man with a soft touch and huge heart.\" The eighth and final victim was 31-year-old Belgian Ann-Laure Decadt.</p><p>In a statement, her husband called her a fantastic wife and the most beautiful mom to our two sons of three months and three years old. He said, \"This loss is unbearable.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[02:05:11] VAUSE: This is CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.

I am a professor of law at New York University School of Law. I hold the chair of Walter J. Derenberg Professor of Trade Regulation. I have been a member of the faculty of NYU School of Law since 1976. Immediately before then I was a partner in the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. I graduated from New York University School of Law in 1961 and hold an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Paris-Dauphine (2009).</p><p>My books include a casebook EU COMPETITION LAW (Elgar 2017) co- authored with Damien Gerard; a casebook US ANTITRUST IN GLOBAL CONTEXT (3rd ed. West 2012); a casebook EUROPEAN UNION LAW (4TH ed. West 2015) co-authored with Goebel, Bermann, Atik, Emmert &amp; Gerard; and a study THE DESIGN OF COMPETITION LAW INSTITUTIONS with Michael Trebilcock (Oxford 2013). My book with Mor Bakhoum, MAKING MARKETS WORK IN AFRICA, will be published in January 2019 by Oxford University Press. My bio may be found on my NYU Law faculty page at <url normalizedValue=\"https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&amp;personid=19924\">https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&amp;personid=19924</url></p><p>I am pleased to discuss the comparative approaches of the United States and the European Union to the monopoly/abuse of dominance problem, and to suggest how the comparison might facilitate thinking about the new problems we confront in the high tech, big data space. I will first explain the similarities and differences between the two bodies of law, and second suggest lessons from cross-fertilization.</p><p>I attach a short interview of me on the subject of US/EU competition law and big tech, and my article, ``Why Europe Is Different.``</p><p>I. A COMPARISON</p><p>The United States</p><p>The US Sherman Act was enacted in 1890 to control the power of the big trusts. Senator John Sherman famously said: ``If we will not endure a king..., we should not endure a king of trade.``1 Through major legislation in 1914 (the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act) and 1950 (the Cellar Kefauver merger act), Congress extended the reach of the law to control power, to protect the little guy, and to stem a rising tide of economic concentration for social, political and economic ends. Congress tried to ensure against fascism, at one end, and communism, at the other, by protecting the market. Antitrust was the economic democracy of the market.2 But through the years the Supreme Court excessively expanded the law`s reach, condemning some perfectly normal aggressive business behavior, and, beginning especially in 1981 with the Reagan Administration, the Supreme Court set about to cut back the reach of the law. Case by case, the law changed to an efficiency prescription. For mergers the paradigm became: There should be no antitrust intervention unless the transaction would decrease consumer surplus. In monopoly cases, the Court assumed and assumes that what firms do is good for consumers; that freedom of even dominant firms will produce the most efficiency and innovation and thus will be best for consumers, competitiveness and markets. Today in US monopoly law (Section 2 of the Sherman Act), there is relatively small scope for condemnation of conduct as anticompetitive. To be condemned, the acts must not only constitute a use of monopoly power; they must create more monopoly power or at least entrench existing power. And by default presumption, the Court assumes that this will not happen; that the market will work.3 Many lower courts, and often our two excellent federal antitrust agencies, are more watchful watchdogs against abuses of power than Supreme Court jurisprudence would predict.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Meanwhile in Europe, at the end of World War II, a critical core of European nations resolved to create a new structure of governance so as never to have a war again. Six nations, led by Germany, France and Italy, formed first the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951/52 and then the European Economic Community in 1957/58. The project depended upon community - upon a single European market. As Adam Smith said, people who trade (intensely) together don`t fight wars with one another. They come to respect one another and leave hatreds behind.4 Free trade in the internal market was at the heart of the conception. That meant border barriers must fall. But as the founders correctly anticipated, once tariffs and quotas were abolished, private firms would conspire to re-erect them, and they did. Moreover, most of the nations had their own national champions, often state-owned, and almost always beneficiaries of state-conferred privilege. Thus it was necessary to include antitrust within the Treaty itself, to prevent private power and privileged enterprises from undermining community. As a result, the EU Treaty contains Article 101, against anticompetitive agreements, and Article 102, against abuse of dominance.5</p><p>Like the US, the EU went through two important phases with regard to the question: When is single-firm conduct anticompetitive? In the first stage, EU law was formalistic. It was very hard on dominant firm conduct that had exclusionary effects on smaller firms. It contained broad presumptions against, for example, exclusive contracts by dominant firms. The second phase came in the 1990s and even more dramatically in the first decade of the new millennium, epitomized by the 2009 guidance on dominant firm conduct.6 In this second phase, the European Commission adopted, and the Courts followed, a more economic approach.7 While incorporating economic analysis into the law, Europe retained certain guiding principles and approaches reflecting the place of antitrust in the Treaty. These approaches include: EU law is about community and integration. EU competition law is sympathetic with EU`s internal market free-movement law, which stresses the importance of free movement across Member State lines. Likewise, EU law is antagonistic to Member State restraints and the privileges they grant to favored firms. It views such restraints and privileges as distortions of competition. Both aspects - respect for free movement and antagonism to state restraints - are imported into EU competition law and specifically into abuse of dominance law. EU competition law stresses market access and the right to contest markets on the merits. It is sympathetic to access to networks. It is hostile to dominant firms` using leverage to take advantages for themselves at the expense of competitors, thereby ``unleveling the playing field.`` It does not aim to protect inefficient competitors. Rather, EU precedents safeguard a clearer path of the outsider to access markets on the merits, free from obstructions by dominant firms. Nonetheless, from the point of view of detractors who worry about excessive enforcement against dominant firms, the EU approach does protect competitors.</p><p>Presumption and Divergence</p><p>EU competition law adopted its more economic approach nearly two decades ago. However, it never adopted the Chicago School premises. It does not assume markets work well. It does not admonish: Trust the market - especially not when the market is concentrated and dominated by a single firm. It does not presume that antitrust intervention is likely to mess up the market and chill competition and innovation. Its teaching implies a belief that lowering barriers to entry and keeping a clear path for challengers is likely to make the market more dynamic and thus serve consumers better. When dealing with innovation incentives, US cases are likely to assume that antitrust action against a dominant firm will chill the firm`s incentives to invent.8 EU law is more likely to find that the dominant firm`s challenged conduct will chill the outsiders` incentives to invent, and has documented this effect in specific cases. While US competition law abhors duties of dominant firms to deal with competitors, calling such duties ``forced sharing,`` undermining incentives to invent,10 EU law applies a contrary principle: Dominant firms, especially firms with power in one market who compete in an adjacent market, have the special responsibility not to impair rivals` competition on the merits.</p><p>Both jurisdictions want to preserve and facilitate sustainable low pricing even if it displaces small firms that can`t keep up with the competition, but US law makes it harder than does EU law to attack below cost pricing. US law requires the plaintiff to prove a probable recoupment scenario (defendant must be likely to recover its losses by charging monopoly prices high enough and long enough after the predatory siege).11 EU law does not require proof of probable recoupment where the dominant firm had exclusionary intent.12 It is enough that the predator thought the scheme was worth it.</p><p>Despite these different presumptions and principles, much of the unilateral conduct law is virtually identical on both sides of the ocean. But the different presumptions and principles have resulted in diametrically different results on nearly identical facts in some key cases, especially regarding refusal to deal, as described in my attached article, Why Europe is Different.13</p><p>II. Implications for Big Tech, Big Data</p><p>The big tech, big data firms are posing challenges to this country and to the world. A handful of high tech giants are dominating markets. The firms generally were started from scratch by entrepreneurs with great ideas that have attracted millions of users. They are networks and make use of network effects, which please consumers (who get more friends or suppliers or buyers), but create high barriers to entry and, with it, power. They offer their products on one side of the market for zero; on the other side they make huge revenues from advertising, often by selling the data of their users. They operate with low-price models, not the high prices that have traditionally attracted antitrust attention. Some have been exposed for serious misuses of data. Some have waged media campaigns of false information against critics.</p><p>The platforms that offer services in competition with their customers tend to prefer their own products and demote their rivals, to stamp out creative rivals by appropriating their ideas, to mine the data of the firms they host to provide the next big thing, and to breach privacy. Are the firms violating the competition laws? Does it depend on whether the laws are those of the US or those of the EU? It might.</p><p>The new forms of business, even to the extent that they may be abusive, pose challenging questions under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The market definitions are difficult and contestable. Monopoly power may be hard to prove, especially if, as usual, power is measured by the extent to which the firm can raise price above a competitive price for a significant time. Anticompetitive conduct may be difficult to prove, especially if the plaintiff must establish, as frequently demanded, that the conduct lowers output and raises prices.</p><p>Under EU competition law, the case is easier to make. EU law is less demanding of proof of the market. Moreover, a firm might hold a dominant position even when it does not have monopoly power or be dangerously likely to get it as demanded in the United States. It might be a gatekeeper rather than a traditional monopolist. A firm might abuse its dominance when it uses its power in one market to get significant competitive advantages in an adjacent market by blocking competitors` access by conduct that has no competitive merit. An important platform might abuse its dominance under EU law by refusing to deal fairly with a competing rival on the platform when the refusal squeezes out an otherwise efficient rival.</p><p>These qualities of EU law make it a more flexible tool than the Sherman Act to deal with the new problems of high tech/big data. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition, also has this flexibility. The flexibility does not prejudge the answers. The European Commission and Courts14 and the US FTC would want to consider all of the facts; they would consider the reasons for and benefits of the challenged conduct. They would consider the effects on innovation on both sides - the insider seeking to justify its strategy and the outsider or user seeking fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and nonexploitative treatment. The European Commission and the US FTC can consider the consumer protection as well as the antitrust the problems; and the European Commission may consider any violations of the European privacy directive. A holistic treatment of the issues might be what we need.</p><p>The standard for analysis: US/EU</p><p>I will comment on the standard for analysis: What is anticompetitive? Here, perhaps surprisingly, US and EU competition law converge in broad concept, even while displaying big differences in presumptions and applications. Both the US and the EU, by their antitrust laws, are trying to protect the market. Neither law protects inefficient competitors from competition itself. Both laws welcome the winds of competition and sustained low pricing. The Court of Justice expresses the goal of EU competition law variously as protecting consumers` interests and as protecting the interests of all market players - meaning all but those who want protection or privilege.15 The US Supreme Court sometimes says the goal of US antitrust is consumer welfare and sometimes says (as did Justice Breyer in Leegin) ``to maintain a marketplace free of anticompetitive practices.``16 This is the market goal, the robust market goal, or the market process goal. What it does not admit into the antitrust paradigm is protection of non-competition interests.</p><p>There is a false dichotomy afoot that says: Either we protect the tried and true standard of consumer welfare17 or we sink into a mire of special interests. The real dichotomy is antitrust as market law versus antitrust without market boundaries. US antitrust and EU competition law are market law. This, of course, is the tip of another inquiry - What interventions are good and important to help make the market work better for the good of the people, or to prevent its degradation by the use of economic power? This essay has described two points of view or perspective in answer to the question. Still, the basic market facts that the analyst needs to know are virtually the same.</p><p>Does Europe Discriminate?</p><p>I am of course aware that various colleagues and even Presidents have accused the European Commission of suing successful American high tech firms because they are successful. I have read the European decisions and judgments carefully and I do not believe that the European Commission has discriminated against American firms. The principles applied by the EU courts and Commission to the US firms are principles deeply embedded in the European competition law jurisprudence. Breaking company with US law, EU competition law imposes on dominant firms responsibilities to deal fairly with rivals that are their customers. The whole EU Treaty exudes sympathy with non-discriminatory market access. It is not surprising that President of the European Commission Junker listed second in his 10 Commission priorities for 2015-19: a digital single market.18 And it is worthy of note that cases very similar to the EU cases have been brought or advocated to be brought in the United States.19</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The US antitrust law on monopolization and the EU competition law on abuse of dominance share much in common. They proscribe the anticompetitive conduct of dominant or monopoly firms. However they often part ways in their application, because the United States maintains a default posture that even dominant firms tend to act in the interests of consumers, and a perspective that duties to deal are perverse because they undercut incentives (of the dominant firm) to invent; and in Europe the dominant firm has the responsibility not to obstruct outsiders` efficient competition on the merits, and Europe (more clearly) aspires to unleash outsiders` as well as incumbents` innovation. This century has revealed new forms of competition and innovation and also new forms of power and its abuse. For solutions, we may need law flexible enough and enforcers wise and knowledgeable enough to deal with these new sources and uses of power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200005480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55P0-6D01-F06P-24K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Data Licensing, LLC.

Imagine a country where its leader embraces the victims and their communities as their own, rejects the assailant, and refuses to speak his name, denying him the notoriety he seeks. Imagine a country where the major advertisers pull adds from Facebook and Twitter because of their irresponsible failure to delete hate content (\"After N.Z. carnage, big tech must change,\" Editorial, March 16).</p><p>New Zealand has just done all of this in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. The language about firearms has been careful and measured \u2013 the target of the assault-weapons ban is a class of weapons, not gun-owners. The buy-back program announced is to be enforced by fines and imprisonment and curtails any possibility of a rush to buy more weapons before the ban goes into effect. Also prohibited will be devices to turn firearms into semiautomatic weapons or have high magazine capacity, because such weapons should never be available in the civilian market.</p><p>Germany already prohibits Twitter from having any posts with Nazi or neo-Nazi language. This is the kind of action and leadership we in the United States and so many other countries desperately need. May all the many groups organizing for better gun control, for action to curtail white supremacist terrorism, for regulation to end the tech giant's irresponsible handling of hate content, and for ways to stand up for values that protect fundamental human rights take heart.</p><p>Nancy Krieger</p><p>Jamaica Plain</p><p>The writer is a professor of social epidemiology at Harvard's T.H.

Facebook defended its response to the video uploads, saying in a March 18 blog post that it removed the attacker's video \"within minutes\" after New Zealand police flagged it and deleted the Facebook and Instagram Inc. accounts of the alleged shooter.</p><p>Facebook said it removed about 1.5 million videos within the first 24 hours of the attack and blocked over 1.2 million of those videos at the time of upload. The video was viewed about 4,000 times in total before being removed from Facebook, the company added.</p><p>Flowers laid outside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New ZealandSource: Associated Press Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who specializes in criminal law and First Amendment law, said Facebook and its counterparts have long had a \"devil-may-care attitude\" about their livestreaming offerings and must address whether the products are doing more harm than good.</p><p>\"You shouldn't be inflicting [livestreaming services] upon the public unless you can use it responsibly,\" Franks said in an interview. \"And if the answer is [livestreaming] cannot be used responsibly, then it shouldn't exist.\"</p><p>Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the United States Naval Academy, agreed that Facebook and other internet giants must step up their content moderation efforts, but noted that it is nearly impossible to keep all offensive content off the platforms.</p><p>\"We can't just say improving moderation is the magic solution,\" Kosseff said. \"It would be overly optimistic to think that any platform would be able to moderate all harmful content while keeping up all unobjectionable content.\"</p><p>Kosseff added that social media companies' self-regulatory effort in policing abusive content is a more effective solution than enacting stringent laws. \"I get a little nervous about the government imposing too many content restrictions because that's very contrary to First Amendment values,\" Kosseff said.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, has touted his company's increased investments in security of late, including developing more advanced artificial intelligence techniques to remove fake accounts and adding more security reviewers, among other measures. Speaking on Facebook's earnings call in January, Zuckerberg acknowledged that the company's increased security investments \"has affected our profitability,\" but added that it is \"the right thing to do.\"</p><p>For her part, Lydia de la Torre, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has expertise in data protection law, added that any \"knee-jerk\" legislation pressed on internet giants could actually take away the various benefits the companies also offer to consumers.</p><p>\"We do have unfortunate situations where people abuse the system, but also we have situations where people enjoy sharing things instantly. It's a question of how you balance that,\" de la Torre said in an interview.</p><p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, wrote a March 19 letter to Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella, requesting a briefing to describe how the New Zealand shooting videos spread on their respective platforms.</p><p>\"Your companies must prioritize responding to these toxic and violent ideologies with resources and attention,\" Thompson wrote in the letter. \"If you are unwilling to do so, Congress must consider policies to ensure that terrorist content is not distributed on your platforms   including by studying the examples being set by other countries.\"</p><p>Political leaders across the globe have called on Facebook and its peers to accept more responsibility for the extremist material posted on their sites.</p><p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a recent speech to New Zealand's Parliament that social media platforms \"are the publisher, not just the postman,\" of abusive content and must be more accountable for what is shared on their sites.</p><p>\"There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility,\" Ardern said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-50674409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRB-G9C1-JDVW-N0RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Its main purpose is to evaluate the situation for journalists in 180 countries and territories across the globe.</p><p>In this regard there's no doubt the index has become an extremely useful advocacy tool in helping promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and in defending media workers rights. </p><p>But vital as such a role is, this serves as little consolation to the fact that the conclusions drawn by the index these past few years have been far from heartening. The current index is no exception, or then again perhaps it is, for rarely in recent times has it portrayed a bleaker picture of the threats facing media freedom worldwide.</p><p>Those threats, of course, have inevitably been amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, as existing and aspiring autocrats around the world crack down on journalists' ability to do their jobs at a time when transparency is more vital than ever.</p><p>In fact, so pressing are those threats that RSF has warned that the next 10 years will pretty much determine the fate of journalism as we know it. \"We are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future,\" says RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire.  \"The coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor,\" Deloire added in his recent summation of the current index ratings.</p><p>Questioning what all this means for freedom of information, pluralism and reliability by 2030, Deloire maintains the answer to that is already being determined and as we move through this \"decisive decade\", five converging crises are having a malign influence and potentially devastating impact on international journalism.</p><p>The first of these is what RSF says is a \"geopolitical crisis\" due to aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes, which coronavirus has already starkly highlighted.</p><p>The second is a \"technological crisis\" resulting from the lack of appropriate regulation of digitalised communication, creating a kind of \"information chaos\" blurring the lines between fact, fiction, propaganda and advertising, often putting them in direct competition with mainstream bona fide journalism.</p><p>The third crisis in this perfect storm facing journalism highlighted by RSF is a growing physical hostility towards journalists globally. </p><p>Much of this hostility, it concludes, is an offshoot of the hatred towards the press fomented by some political leaders such as US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.</p><p>\"Hostility toward journalists and news outlets in the US deepened and intensified, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president,\" the media watchdog concluded.</p><p>\"The abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, as journalists covering the Trump administration's response to the crisis are subjected to the president's attacks during his press briefings,\" it added.</p><p>According to the index ratings, the US now ranks 45th out of 180 countries. A \"dangerous anti-press sentiment\" as well as the arrest, physical assault, public denigration and harassment of journalists had trickled down to the local level in America, the report determined.</p><p>Related to this open hostility and the last of the five elements in the crises press freedom faces is one of trust, says RSF. Or put another way the public suspects broadcast and print news to have been contaminated by unreliable information.</p><p>In making its case for this, the media watchdog cites a recent Edelman Trust Barometer conducted by the US-based public relations group that studies public trust in institutions.</p><p>According to those polled in Edelman's latest international survey, 57% of people believed the media they used were contaminated with information they thought untrustworthy. That in itself, most would admit, is cause for serious concern, but combined with the other threats outlined, all five converge into one enormous challenge to the worldwide press of the future.</p><p>It's a sobering thought not least today, May 3, as we mark World Press Freedom Day along with its theme this year of \"journalism without fear or favour\".</p><p>In order to understand in real terms just what these threats mean to journalism's future, it's worth drilling down a little deeper into their implications.  </p><p>The obvious place to start is with the impact of the pandemic itself. Having said that, long before the emergence of coronavirus, world press freedoms were recognised as being in decline. </p><p>For many years journalists have weathered authoritarian regimes and threats to their safety. But where most observers are now in near total agreement is that the pandemic has brought a new dynamic to the media landscape exposing the long-term risks of suppressed press freedoms</p><p>As Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) points out, those countries that stifle independent news and jail journalists in \"normal\" times have already been hard at work. </p><p>In what some journalists have called the global \"Covid crackdown,\" China and Iran, 177th and 173rd respectively in the Press Freedom Index, tried to quarantine the truth. In Iran's case the leadership there censored news of its spread with devastating consequences for public health.</p><p>Many media monitoring groups are now concerned that, for the most part, governments have been getting away with their efforts to impede independent journalism without being called out by other countries, all of which are also preoccupied in dealing with the pandemic. </p><p>\"Governments in Thailand, through Hungary and Egypt to Honduras, are using the cloud cover of the diseases to introduce emergency measures that could roll back basic freedoms, clamp down on the press, or restrict foreign correspondents,\" warned Mahoney of the CPJ recently on Al azeera. </p><p>At its worst this manifests itself in arrests, detention, intimidation, physical threats and sometimes murder. </p><p>In terms of Covid-19-related reporting, human rights group Amnesty International last week highlighted a handful of cases where reporters have been prosecuted or threatened. Among them was that of Russian journalist Elena Milashina whose newspaper Novaya Gazeta on April 12blished an article in which she criticised the Chechen authorities' response to the pandemic. </p><p>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in turn posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Service (FSB) to \"stop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people\". In Egypt, meanwhile, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper on March 18, and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenged the official statistics on Covid-19 cases.</p><p>In Venezuela, it was journalist Darvinson Rojas who spent 12 days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources. </p><p>These are only three of many instances globally where reporting on the pandemic brought journalists under threat, but it's not only during the current crisis that such measures have been documented </p><p>Last year, 142 serious threats to press freedom were recorded, including 33 physical attacks on journalists. A total of 43 cases of intimidation and direct threat have been listed in a report compiled by several media organisations, among them RSF, the Association of European Journalists and the International Press Institute. </p><p>Late last year, too, 105 journalists were imprisoned for their work, primarily in Turkey, Russia, and Azerbaijan. </p><p>As Otmar Lahodynsky, president of the Association of European Journalists (AEJ) wrote recently in the EU affairs newspaper NewEurope, the takeover of media by oligarchs and governments in Hungary, Poland, and Serbia were also noted and criticised in the report. </p><p>\"Many public-service broadcasters have been turned into uncritical propaganda channels for the government. Abuses of media freedom are also increasing in Western Europe,\" says Lahodynsky, adding that political influence on the media is increasing in many of the 47 countries that count themselves as members of the Council of Europe.</p><p>But beyond these obvious threats to journalism and its future lie others, many economic, with job cuts gutting newsrooms. As RSF makes clear, the digital transformation has brought the media to their knees in many countries. </p><p>Falling sales, the collapse in advertising revenue and the increase in production and distribution costs have in turn forced news organisations to restructure and lay off journalists.</p><p>\"The economic crisis has also accentuated the phenomena of ownership concentration and, even more, conflicts of interest, which threaten journalistic pluralism and independence,\" warns the watchdog.</p><p>The bottom line here is that global journalism currently faces both old threats and new, raising the inevitable question of how best to protect and nurture its existence in the \"decisive decade\" that lies ahead. </p><p>According to Farhana Haque Rahman, senior vice-president of the global news agency Inter Press Service, ultimately, just as in a pandemic, the freedom of the press can only be guaranteed by a co-ordinated global effort and a focus on highlighting the long-term advantages of a more critical world. </p><p>\"This means pressure to reinforce legal frameworks, including prosecuting harassers and killers, perhaps just as the international community would persecute war criminals, while offering a global protection for journalists,\" says Rahman.</p><p>\"Finding and promoting innovative ways of subsidising independent media, as well as getting big tech companies to pay for the content they share, is also crucial to help a free press to thrive,\" she says.</p><p>Just as the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a marathon not a sprint, so must the long-term future of journalism be viewed in the same terms.</p><p>Ever since the United Nations proclaimed World Press Freedom Day on this date back in 1993, the obstacles facing independent reporting have consistently been immense.</p><p>Censorship, smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention, threats of physical assault and murder are the challenges journalists across many parts of the world have had to contend with. </p><p>These are unprecedented times and, as one colleague recently observed, no working journalist alive has ever covered anything like this story of the pandemic. Even veterans of war reporting or Ebola coverage have had to re-evaluate risk and learn new skills. </p><p>As we mark World Press Freedom Day it's obvious that many challenges beyond the current one lie in wait. Most likely these will put the very heart of journalistic practice and the ability to carry it out without fear or favour to an unprecedented test. </p><p>To say we need journalism now more than ever is true. But it also masks a reality worth reiterating, one that makes clear the importance of having a free press each and every day, whether the story is of global or local concern. </p><p>In either instance, holding power to account and performing a public interest role is fundamental to this. But just as the press holds the powers at be to account, so too do we need reasoned critical consumers of the media, those similarly capable of holding the media to task for any misrepresentations of the truth.</p><p>It was the great French author and journalist Albert Camus who once observed that: \"A free press can of course, be good or bad, but most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.\" </p><p>If, as the World Press Freedom report suggests, the next 10 years prove to be an unprecedented test for the media, then good journalism will need all the allies it can muster.</p><p>As RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire, rightly pointed out: \"For this decisive decade to not be a disastrous one, people of goodwill, whoever they are, must campaign for journalists to be able to fulfil their role as society's trusted third parties, which means they must have the capacity to do so.\" </p><p>Speaking as someone with a vested interest in that happening, I can only say how welcome that trust would be. But equally, however, those within my profession must realise that in order for that to take place, we too must prove ourselves worthy of that same trust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNHER-NQ248121523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNHER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTH-FYD1-JD7N-K3YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172807</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Herald (Glasgow)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>agriculture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>health terms</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Civil Rights Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC371</classCode><className>KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

He, in fact, doesn't like to be called a VC investor \u2014 he prefers the title \u201cventure assistant\u201d, someone whose job is to help out promising businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khosla, an IIT-Delhi and Stanford alumnus who cofounded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and later started his own firm Khosla Ventures, doesn't believe in attending board meetings, placing greater emphasis on one-to-ones with entrepreneurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An industry veteran, he has witnessed many technology and business shifts over the past three decades, but the 64-year-old has no immediate plans to hang up his boots. His company has made several bets in the clean-tech space and more recently, in biomedicine and robotics. Khosla Ventures' recent successes include payments startups Square and Stripe and delivery firms Instacart and DoorDash. Khosla is also an investor in Impossible Foods, which serves up meatless burgers.</p><p>In a chat with TOI, he covered a range of topics, from the origins of the startup ecosystems in India and the US, regulation of the Big Tech companies and American politics to opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>You visit India every few years. What do you think of current startup ecosystem in India compared to its state four-five years ago?</p><p>It's clearly getting more entrepreneurial. There are higher quality startups and I met about a dozen of them today. They are as good as Y Combinator startups that I see in the US. That's encouraging. They are still mostly in the software domain and narrower areas, unlike in the US where we see very broad domains. This is why I was encouraging people to look at other areas such as food, 3D printing and manufacturing.</p><p>Look, this kind of ecosystem needs some successful entrepreneurs who can mentor the next generation. Then things get bigger and better. People like Sachin Bansal start companies again, then scale gets larger. India will do well as an entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially globally.</p><p>Do you think Flipkart exit was a pivotal moment for Indian startup ecosystem?</p><p>Flipkart would have been successful no matter what. But the exit created enough liquidity for people from Flipkart to start their own companies and invest in other startups. Or they can mentor people at other startups. Exits like Flipkart are pivotal in changing the mindset of entrepreneurs that we can build larger companies.</p><p>What are the areas where Indian ecosystem must catch up with China or US?</p><p>Fintech is very clear. There is Ant Financial in China, but there is nothing comparable to that in India. China has done well, and they are a little bit ahead of India in startups; whether it's Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu, each has picked an area of its own. I am hopeful we will see that emerge in India too.</p><p>In fintech, Indian firms have faced unfavourable policies, and RBI has a conservative approach on issues such as cryptocurrency. What is regulators' role in growing the ecosystem?</p><p>You know, regulators have a serious responsibility \u2014 they have to make sure fraud does not happen. But by and large, Indian regulators have been very open-minded compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Take for instance the Digital Sky initiative (for drone operators). Aadhaar was a good example, but UPI is even better one. Not enough startups have popped up to take advantage of UPI, payment systems or banking/new insurance. But I get the sense that regulators are working with startups in a good way.</p><p>Blockchain is the only area where we haven't seen huge progress. And you know, blockchain had one disadvantage \u2014 all its use cases were illegal and so regulators naturally (were against it). All its uses were monetary. Non-monetary uses of blockchain are very valuable. Data privacy should be done in blockchain, so you don't have to trust anybody. Nandan's [Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani] new effort around federated data is great. Setting new standards will enable a new set of entrepreneurs.</p><p>In digital infrastructure, India is ahead of many countries. Look at Aadhaar, UPI and Digital Sky; these government efforts make the scene more progressive. In the US, things are owned by a private corporation, whether it is Facebook for messaging or Google for search. So, setting up standards is a really good idea.</p><p>RBI's stand on cryptocurrency has led to some startups shutting down...</p><p>I am supportive of the stand that the RBI has taken. I think Bitcoin's use is mostly illegal. If you are going to have an orderly society, you can't have money outside the system. But having blockchain-based services like privacy will be a great idea.</p><p>What is the mood in Silicon Valley? Many new firms, like Slack and Zoom, are getting listed, but there's also the talk of regulating Big Tech.</p><p>The regulatory stuff does not impact startups; it gives them an advantage. Bigger technology companies have more constraints and anti-trust concerns. It may impact the buyout market, where big companies were acquiring startups.</p><p>Some US presidential candidates have proposed breaking up big companies.</p><p>As you know, politics is politics. You must take extreme positions to get noticed. On most policies, very few candidates are taking positions that they will carry through, like healthcare for all at a cost of trillions of dollars. And frankly, there are 20 of them, so they have to distinguish themselves.

He, in fact, doesn't like to be called a VC investor \u2014 he prefers the title \u201cventure assistant\u201d, someone whose job is to help out promising businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khosla, an IIT-Delhi and Stanford alumnus who cofounded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and later started his own firm Khosla Ventures, doesn't believe in attending board meetings, placing greater emphasis on one-to-ones with entrepreneurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An industry veteran, he has witnessed many technology and business shifts over the past three decades, but the 64-year-old has no immediate plans to hang up his boots. His company has made several bets in the clean-tech space and more recently, in biomedicine and robotics. Khosla Ventures' recent successes include payments startups Square and Stripe and delivery firms Instacart and DoorDash. Khosla is also an investor in Impossible Foods, which serves up meatless burgers.</p><p>In a chat with TOI, he covered a range of topics, from the origins of the startup ecosystems in India and the US, regulation of the Big Tech companies and American politics to opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>You visit India every few years. What do you think of current startup ecosystem in India compared to its state four-five years ago?</p><p>It's clearly getting more entrepreneurial. There are higher quality startups and I met about a dozen of them today. They are as good as Y Combinator startups that I see in the US. That's encouraging. They are still mostly in the software domain and narrower areas, unlike in the US where we see very broad domains. This is why I was encouraging people to look at other areas such as food, 3D printing and manufacturing.</p><p>Look, this kind of ecosystem needs some successful entrepreneurs who can mentor the next generation. Then things get bigger and better. People like Sachin Bansal start companies again, then scale gets larger. India will do well as an entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially globally.</p><p>Do you think Flipkart exit was a pivotal moment for Indian startup ecosystem?</p><p>Flipkart would have been successful no matter what. But the exit created enough liquidity for people from Flipkart to start their own companies and invest in other startups. Or they can mentor people at other startups. Exits like Flipkart are pivotal in changing the mindset of entrepreneurs that we can build larger companies.</p><p>What are the areas where Indian ecosystem must catch up with China or US?</p><p>Fintech is very clear. There is Ant Financial in China, but there is nothing comparable to that in India. China has done well, and they are a little bit ahead of India in startups; whether it's Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu, each has picked an area of its own. I am hopeful we will see that emerge in India too.</p><p>In fintech, Indian firms have faced unfavourable policies, and RBI has a conservative approach on issues such as cryptocurrency. What is regulators' role in growing the ecosystem?</p><p>You know, regulators have a serious responsibility \u2014 they have to make sure fraud does not happen. But by and large, Indian regulators have been very open-minded compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Take for instance the Digital Sky initiative (for drone operators). Aadhaar was a good example, but UPI is even better one. Not enough startups have popped up to take advantage of UPI, payment systems or banking/new insurance. But I get the sense that regulators are working with startups in a good way.</p><p>Blockchain is the only area where we haven't seen huge progress. And you know, blockchain had one disadvantage \u2014 all its use cases were illegal and so regulators naturally (were against it). All its uses were monetary. Non-monetary uses of blockchain are very valuable. Data privacy should be done in blockchain, so you don't have to trust anybody. Nandan's [Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani] new effort around federated data is great. Setting new standards will enable a new set of entrepreneurs.</p><p>In digital infrastructure, India is ahead of many countries. Look at Aadhaar, UPI and Digital Sky; these government efforts make the scene more progressive. In the US, things are owned by a private corporation, whether it is Facebook for messaging or Google for search. So, setting up standards is a really good idea.</p><p>RBI's stand on cryptocurrency has led to some startups shutting down...</p><p>I am supportive of the stand that the RBI has taken. I think Bitcoin's use is mostly illegal. If you are going to have an orderly society, you can't have money outside the system. But having blockchain-based services like privacy will be a great idea.</p><p>What is the mood in Silicon Valley? Many new firms, like Slack and Zoom, are getting listed, but there's also the talk of regulating Big Tech.</p><p>The regulatory stuff does not impact startups; it gives them an advantage. Bigger technology companies have more constraints and anti-trust concerns. It may impact the buyout market, where big companies were acquiring startups.</p><p>Some US presidential candidates have proposed breaking up big companies.</p><p>As you know, politics is politics. You must take extreme positions to get noticed. On most policies, very few candidates are taking positions that they will carry through, like healthcare for all at a cost of trillions of dollars. And frankly, there are 20 of them, so they have to distinguish themselves. They will all move to the centre to take on Donald Trump.</p><p>How should anti-trust regulators in markets like India view the developments?</p><p>I think data privacy is an issue and steps are being taken; Indian regulators should keep an eye on that. Antitrust, I would let the world sort it out. India is a competitive market anyway, and no matter what area, foreign companies don't do as well here as they do in other emerging markets.

He, in fact, doesn't like to be called a VC investor - he prefers the title \"venture assistant\", someone whose job is to help out promising businesses.\u00a0Khosla, an IIT-Delhi and Stanford alumnus who cofounded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and later started his own firm Khosla Ventures, doesn't believe in attending board meetings, placing greater emphasis on one-to-ones with entrepreneurs.\u00a0An industry veteran, he has witnessed many technology and business shifts over the past three decades, but the 64-year-old has no immediate plans to hang up his boots. His company has made several bets in the clean-tech space and more recently, in biomedicine and robotics. Khosla Ventures' recent successes include payments startups Square and Stripe and delivery firms Instacart and DoorDash. Khosla is also an investor in Impossible Foods, which serves up meatless burgers.\u00a0In a chat with TOI, he covered a range of topics, from the origins of the startup ecosystems in India and the US, regulation of the Big Tech companies and American politics to opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0You visit India every few years. </p><p>What do you think of current startup ecosystem in India compared to its state four-five years ago?It's clearly getting more entrepreneurial. There are higher quality startups and I met about a dozen of them today. They are as good as Y Combinator startups that I see in the US. That's encouraging. They are still mostly in the software domain and narrower areas, unlike in the US where we see very broad domains. This is why I was encouraging people to look at other areas such as food, 3D printing and manufacturing.\u00a0Look, this kind of ecosystem needs some successful entrepreneurs who can mentor the next generation. Then things get bigger and better. People like Sachin Bansal start companies again, then scale gets larger. India will do well as an entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially globally.\u00a0Do you think Flipkart exit was a pivotal moment for Indian startup ecosystem?\u00a0Flipkart would have been successful no matter what. But the exit created enough liquidity for people from Flipkart to start their own companies and invest in other startups. Or they can mentor people at other startups. Exits like Flipkart are pivotal in changing the mindset of entrepreneurs that we can build larger companies.\u00a0What are the areas where Indian ecosystem must catch up with China or US?\u00a0Fintech is very clear. There is Ant Financial in China, but there is nothing comparable to that in India. China has done well, and they are a little bit ahead of India in startups; whether it's Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu, each has picked an area of its own. I am hopeful we will see that emerge in India too.\u00a0In fintech, Indian firms have faced unfavourable policies, and RBI has a conservative approach on issues such as cryptocurrency. What is regulators' role in growing the ecosystem?\u00a0You know, regulators have a serious responsibility - they have to make sure fraud does not happen. But by and large, Indian regulators have been very open-minded compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Take for instance the Digital Sky initiative (for drone operators). Aadhaar was a good example, but UPI is even better one. Not enough startups have popped up to take advantage of UPI, payment systems or banking/new insurance. But I get the sense that regulators are working with startups in a good way.\u00a0Blockchain is the only area where we haven't seen huge progress. And you know, blockchain had one disadvantage - all its use cases were illegal and so regulators naturally (were against it). All its uses were monetary. Non-monetary uses of blockchain are very valuable. Data privacy should be done in blockchain, so you don't have to trust anybody. Nandan's [Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani] new effort around federated data is great. Setting new standards will enable a new set of entrepreneurs.\u00a0In digital infrastructure, India is ahead of many countries. Look at Aadhaar, UPI and Digital Sky; these government efforts make the scene more progressive. In the US, things are owned by a private corporation, whether it is Facebook for messaging or Google for search. So, setting up standards is a really good idea.\u00a0RBI's stand on cryptocurrency has led to some startups shutting down...\u00a0I am supportive of the stand that the RBI has taken. I think Bitcoin's use is mostly illegal. If you are going to have an orderly society, you can't have money outside the system. But having blockchain-based services like privacy will be a great idea.\u00a0What is the mood in Silicon Valley? Many new firms, like Slack and Zoom, are getting listed, but there's also the talk of regulating Big Tech.\u00a0The regulatory stuff does not impact startups; it gives them an advantage. Bigger technology companies have more constraints and anti-trust concerns. It may impact the buyout market, where big companies were acquiring startups.\u00a0Some US presidential candidates have proposed breaking up big companies.\u00a0As you know, politics is politics. You must take extreme positions to get noticed. On most policies, very few candidates are taking positions that they will carry through, like healthcare for all at a cost of trillions of dollars. And frankly, there are 20 of them, so they have to distinguish themselves. They will all move to the centre to take on Donald Trump.\u00a0How should anti-trust regulators in markets like India view the developments?\u00a0I think data privacy is an issue and steps are being taken; Indian regulators should keep an eye on that. Antitrust, I would let the world sort it out. India is a competitive market anyway, and no matter what area, foreign companies don't do as well here as they do in other emerging markets. That's because Indian entrepreneurs are pretty good and competitive. Tell me which telecom company can compete with Reliance Jio? They can't, because of the bets Mukesh Ambani places.\u00a0Indian government's tech policy talks about treating data as a public good, and data localisation. Is that the way forward?\u00a0Look, there are two things. One is what is fair and what you can get away with regulating. Outside the advertising model, data is still valuable, but not as valuable as people think. My view is that most of the artificial intelligence (AI) systems will need new kinds of data, and not old data. If you ask six-yearolds to learn what is a table, you don't give them six million examples of a table. You give them three and they do a pretty good job of telling what is shaped like a table.\u00a0I am very confident that the next generation of AI systems won't need huge amounts of data in the next five years. Privacy may still be an issue, but data I don't know.\u00a0Some investors think India can take advantage of technology skillset in AI and machine learning, as it did during IT boom. What are the challenges on this front?\u00a0India has talent. There are two kinds of AI. One is researching and developing new techniques. And then there is applied AI, where I think Indian companies will do really well. You take Healthify, they are doing a pretty good job of applying AI. Research in AI is the domain of PhDs. I haven't seen much activity in India where they may be developing new algorithms and looking at new domains.\u00a0In hyperlocal delivery space in the US, Khosla Ventures is an investor in DoorDash and Instacart. Is this segment the future of commerce? Swiggy and Zomato are burning a lot of capital here.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Both companies [Instacart and DoorDash] have very different trajectories and strategies. DoorDash can become very large; Instacart is in the specific area of groceries. There is a tendency in India to back the winner rather than multiple players. However, I don't track the India market that closely.\u00a0<br/>DoorDash faced controversy over treatment of gig economy workers. What is the ideal way to deal with it?<br/>Once a problem emerges, the next generation of solutions comes up. It is always an iterative process. Now that the problems have surfaced, startups are addressing them. Whoever treats workers better is going to get better workers. You will see a generation of startups working for hourly employees.\u00a0<br/>Any startup you regret not investing in?<br/>\u00a0<br/>Everyone wishes they had invested in Airbnb. We looked at them pretty late, in Series C.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-37872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS5-N801-DYDW-70P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

He, in fact, doesn't like to be called a VC investor - he prefers the title \"venture assistant\", someone whose job is to help out promising businesses.Khosla, an IIT-Delhi and Stanford alumnus who co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and later started his own firm Khosla Ventures, doesn't believe in attending board meetings, placing greater emphasis on one-to-ones with entrepreneurs.An industry veteran, he has witnessed many technology and business shifts over the past three decades, but the 64-year-old has no immediate plans to hang up his boots. His company has made several bets in the clean-tech space and more recently, in biomedicine and robotics. Khosla Ventures' recent successes include payments startups Square and Stripe and delivery firms Instacart and DoorDash. Khosla is also an investor in Impossible Foods, which serves up meatless burgers.In a chat with TOI, he covered a range of topics, from the origins of the startup ecosystems in India and the US, regulation of the Big Tech companies and American politics to opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).You visit India every few years. </p><p>What do you think of current startup ecosystem in India compared to its state four-five years ago?It's clearly getting more entrepreneurial. There are higher quality startups and I met about a dozen of them today. They are as good as Y Combinator startups that I see in the US. That's encouraging. They are still mostly in the software domain and narrower areas, unlike in the US where we see very broad domains. This is why I was encouraging people to look at other areas such as food, 3D printing and manufacturing.Look, this kind of ecosystem needs some successful entrepreneurs who can mentor the next generation. Then things get bigger and better. People like Sachin Bansal start companies again, then scale gets larger. India will do well as an entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially globally.Do you think Flipkart exit was a pivotal moment for Indian startup ecosystem?Flipkart would have been successful no matter what. But the exit created enough liquidity for people from Flipkart to start their own companies and invest in other startups. Or they can mentor people at other startups. Exits like Flipkart are pivotal in changing the mindset of entrepreneurs that we can build larger companies.What are the areas where Indian ecosystem must catch up with China or US?Fintech is very clear. There is Ant Financial in China, but there is nothing comparable to that in India. China has done well, and they are a little bit ahead of India in startups; whether it's Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu, each has picked an area of its own. I am hopeful we will see that emerge in India too.In fintech, Indian firms have faced unfavourable policies, and RBI has a conservative approach on issues such as cryptocurrency. What is regulators' role in growing the ecosystem?You know, regulators have a serious responsibility - they have to make sure fraud does not happen. But by and large, Indian regulators have been very open-minded compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Take for instance the Digital Sky initiative (for drone operators). Aadhaar was a good example, but UPI is even better one. Not enough startups have popped up to take advantage of UPI, payment systems or banking/new insurance. But I get the sense that regulators are working with startups in a good way.Blockchain is the only area where we haven't seen huge progress. And you know, blockchain had one disadvantage - all its use cases were illegal and so regulators naturally (were against it). All its uses were monetary. Non-monetary uses of blockchain are very valuable. Data privacy should be done in blockchain, so you don't have to trust anybody. Nandan's [Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani] new effort around federated data is great. Setting new standards will enable a new set of entrepreneurs.In digital infrastructure, India is ahead of many countries. Look at Aadhaar, UPI and Digital Sky; these government efforts make the scene more progressive. In the US, things are owned by a private corporation, whether it is Facebook for messaging or Google for search. So, setting up standards is a really good idea.RBI's stand on cryptocurrency has led to some startups shutting down...I am supportive of the stand that the RBI has taken. I think Bitcoin's use is mostly illegal. If you are going to have an orderly society, you can't have money outside the system. But having blockchain-based services like privacy will be a great idea.What is the mood in Silicon Valley? Many new firms, like Slack and Zoom, are getting listed, but there's also the talk of regulating Big Tech.The regulatory stuff does not impact startups; it gives them an advantage. Bigger technology companies have more constraints and anti-trust concerns. It may impact the buyout market, where big companies were acquiring startups.Some US presidential candidates have proposed breaking up big companies.As you know, politics is politics. You must take extreme positions to get noticed. On most policies, very few candidates are taking positions that they will carry through, like healthcare for all at a cost of trillions of dollars. And frankly, there are 20 of them, so they have to distinguish themselves. They will all move to the centre to take on Donald Trump.How should anti-trust regulators in markets like India view the developments?I think data privacy is an issue and steps are being taken; Indian regulators should keep an eye on that. Antitrust, I would let the world sort it out. India is a competitive market anyway, and no matter what area, foreign companies don't do as well here as they do in other emerging markets. That's because Indian entrepreneurs are pretty good and competitive. Tell me which telecom company can compete with Reliance Jio? They can't, because of the bets Mukesh Ambani places.Indian government's tech policy talks about treating data as a public good, and data localisation. Is that the way forward?Look, there are two things. One is what is fair and what you can get away with regulating. Outside the advertising model, data is still valuable, but not as valuable as people think. My view is that most of the artificial intelligence (AI) systems will need new kinds of data, and not old data. If you ask six-yearolds to learn what is a table, you don't give them six million examples of a table. You give them three and they do a pretty good job of telling what is shaped like a table.I am very confident that the next generation of AI systems won't need huge amounts of data in the next five years. Privacy may still be an issue, but data I don't know.Some investors think India can take advantage of technology skillset in AI and machine learning, as it did during IT boom. What are the challenges on this front?India has talent. There are two kinds of AI. One is researching and developing new techniques. And then there is applied AI, where I think Indian companies will do really well. You take Healthify, they are doing a pretty good job of applying AI. Research in AI is the domain of PhDs. I haven't seen much activity in India where they may be developing new algorithms and looking at new domains.In hyperlocal delivery space in the US, Khosla Ventures is an investor in DoorDash and Instacart. Is this segment the future of commerce? Swiggy and Zomato are burning a lot of capital here.Both companies [Instacart and DoorDash] have very different trajectories and strategies. DoorDash can become very large; Instacart is in the specific area of groceries. There is a tendency in India to back the winner rather than multiple players. However, I don't track the India market that closely.DoorDash faced controversy over treatment of gig economy workers. What is the ideal way to deal with it?Once a problem emerges, the next generation of solutions comes up. It is always an iterative process. Now that the problems have surfaced, startups are addressing them. Whoever treats workers better is going to get better workers. You will see a generation of startups working for hourly employees.Any startup you regret not investing in?Everyone wishes they had invested in Airbnb. We looked at them pretty late, in Series C.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p>Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p>Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless. But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized.</p><p>However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019. However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing.</p><p>A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by a consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria.</p><p>\"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. Its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019.</p><p>Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell. \"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup.</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure. \"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum. \"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in a statement. \"I welcome this inquiry to ensure that Google is abiding by our country's antitrust laws and expect the company to fully comply with investigators.\"</p><p>\"I've long pushed for stronger oversight of Big Tech, and I'm encouraged that this investigation is being done in a bipartisan way,\" said U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-NH, in a statement. \"I look forward to seeing what comes from it, and I will continue to push for appropriate action to hold Big Tech accountable at the federal level.\"</p><p>MacDonald said in a statement that the internet plays a \"critical role in our business and social lives.\"</p><p>\"The way large corporations such as Google are able to control the flow of information raises significant concerns about business practices, reducing consumer choice, and violating users' privacy,\" MacDonald said.</p><p>\"Today's announcement should send a powerful signal to this industry that state attorneys general are united in their commitment to enforce the laws and protect the public in the digital age. New Hampshire will be actively participating in this important effort and as with any investigation, we will go where the facts lead us.\"</p><p>Past investigations of Google uncovered violations ranging from advertising illegal drugs in the United States to three antitrust actions recently brought by the European Commission.</p><p>None of these previous investigations \"fully address the source of Google's sustained market power and the ability to engage in serial and repeated business practices with the intention to protect and maintain that power,\" according to a news release from MacDonald's office.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-NH said that Granite Staters rely on \"open and equal access to the internet to run their small businesses, get an education, and connect with the world.\"</p><p>\"Now more than ever, when so much of our lives involve connectivity and access to the web, it is important that the internet remain a fair and level playing field where competition is allowed to thrive,\" Pappas said in a statement. \"I plan to closely monitor the suit joined today by the state of New Hampshire.\"</p><p>{span}\"It is imperative that we hold Google and other large technology companies accountable for any violations of anti-trust laws, and we must ensure that they properly secure the sensitive personal and private information of Granite Staters,\" U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-NH, said in a statement. \"As these companies continue to grow in size, so must our efforts to protect the rights of all Americans.\"{/span}</p><p>The advocacy group Public Knowledge said the investigation is a sign that states are taking the \"power of digital platforms seriously.\"</p><p>\"For too long, the substantial and persistent market power of these companies has gone largely unexamined,\" Charlotte Slaiman, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said in a statement.</p><p>\"Opening these antitrust investigations is an important and powerful step forward. Antitrust enforcement in this space can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive. To truly unlock the potential of these industries through competition, Congress must act, too. We need new pro-competition regulations and a dedicated regulatory authority to enforce them.\"</p><p>The Attorney General's Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau, led by Senior Assistant Attorney General Brandon Garod, will participate with other states in this investigation.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pfeely@unionleader.com\">pfeely@unionleader.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-2f3656ced35211e98be600163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X47-C8P1-DYTR-44VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Union Leader Corp.

Donald Trump's claim, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">later retracted</url>, that the NHS would be \"on the table\" in US-UK trade talks underlined the organisation's enduring appeal to the private sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Data is one the areas of interest to commercial players. The NHS database holds the medical records of 65 million people and is drawing the attention of private businesses.</p><p>While other countries' datasets are more fragmented, the NHS database has comprehensive patient records that go back decades. This treasure trove is priceless to technology giants such as Google's parent Alphabet as well as smaller healthcare firms, which are vying to develop health mobile phone apps that perform a host of tasks from monitoring vital organs to carrying out an initial diagnosis.</p><p>Industry experts say the NHS number - the unique 10-digit code attached to every patient and their records - means the UK's health service has a superior dataset that includes information such as patients' medication needs, allergies, vaccinations, previous illnesses, test results and hospital discharge summaries. \"Until very recently a lot of it was paper-based but as more data is digitised it will become increasingly valuable,\" says Julie Simmonds, a healthcare analyst at the stockbroker Panmure Gordon.</p><p>\"It is very valuable for a pharma company. Real world data is better than clinical data.\" Outlining the obvious concerns, she adds: \"It's how you access that and use it in an ethical way - it's going to create concerns.\" </p><p>DeepMind Health, the London-based artificial intelligence company owned by Alphabet, was one of the first to develop a product based on NHS data. In 2016 it launched a mobile phone app, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">Streams</url>, that detects early signs of kidney failure in patients.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">The app</url>, used at London's Royal Free hospital, pulls together medical information, such as patients' blood test results, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">sends alerts to doctors</url> if the results suggest a patient could develop acute kidney injury, which is a condition linked to 100,000 deaths in the UK every year.</p><p>Alphabet's push into UK healthcare was soon at the forefront of expressions of unease over the use of patient data. Last July the Information Commissioner's Office found the Royal Free hospital <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">broke data protection rules</url> when it gave details from 1.6 million patients to DeepMind without informing patients adequately. DeepMind, which used the patient data to test the Streams app, said at the time that it had made mistakes.</p><p>There are other concerns. Streams is being expanded to include alerts for more conditions such as sepsis and other organ failures, and is being rolled out across the UK. DeepMind also wants to distribute it globally. This has alarmed one competitor, who believes DeepMind is using a public asset to build and refine a commercial product that will make significant sums once it is sold to consumers worldwide.</p><p>The former UK science and defence minister Lord Drayson, who runs the AI healthcare firm Sensyne Health, has expressed concerns that Google is able to access the NHS's database for free to develop healthcare apps that it will roll out around the world.</p><p>The Labour peer says: \"NHS data is world-class and a national asset of the UK, potentially worth billions, that could help to fund NHS services in future. Big tech companies shouldn't be able to access NHS data for free.\"</p><p>Drayson, who wants new regulation to safeguard the proper use of patients' medical records, adds: \"This is a sector that is going to be enormous in the future. In other countries the datasets are fragmented. The NHS dataset is across the social spectrum, from birth to death ... That's why Google is here.\"</p><p>A DeepMind spokesperson said: \"There are many ways we recognise and return value to our NHS partners, for example by improving and advancing hospital data sets for future research and offering free access to resulting technology.</p><p>\"Trust data remains under the control of our NHS partners and we can only process it in accordance with their instructions.\"</p><p>Sensyne is also partnering with the NHS to create products that could become global sellers but is offering a cut of the rewards. The Oxford-based firm has struck several partnerships with NHS trusts to develop smartphone apps that monitor heart conditions, lung disease and diabetes in pregnant women. Six NHS trusts have been given shares in Sensyne in return for providing anonymised patient data and will receive 4% of future royalties from any products developed.</p><p>Consultants at EY believe that if the NHS put its vast database to use, by employing artificial intelligence to develop health apps and improve patient treatment, this could generate a \u00a34.6bn benefit to the wider economy because people would be healthier and fitter, taking fewer sick days and working more efficiently.</p><p>Rather than programming systems manually to detect signs of illness - a hard task because of the number of different factors at play - AI systems can be trained to learn how to interpret test results, and which types of treatments are best for individual patients.</p><p> Other companies muscling into the lucrative health technology market include apps such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">Babylon Health</url>, Push Doctor and Now GP, which offer video consultations with GPs. Babylon currently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">offers its app in London</url>, through the Hammersmith &amp; Fulham clinical commissioning group (CCG). It means users, who need to live or work within 30-40 minutes of the practice, deregister from their NHS GP practice to join Babylon's GP at Hand service.</p><p>More than 52,000 people across London have signed up for the Babylon app, which has been championed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary. The Hammersmith and Fulham CCG faces a \u00a321.6m funding gap because it has to pay for the healthcare of all patients registered with the app, even if they do not live in that area.</p><p>The CCG expects NHS England to reimburse those costs. It commissioned a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">report</url> to evaluate GP at Hand, which said it \"raises questions about the financial impact of the service on the wider health system\". The local council's cabinet member for health       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">warned Hancock that it could ultimately lead to practice closures</url> in Hammersmith and Fulham.</p><p>As the wealth and expertise of tech firms expands, and funding pressures on the NHS increase, the interaction between NHS data and the commercial sector is set to grow. The controversy, and the opportunities for life-changing products, will not go away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53546278</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9K-5YW1-F021-610C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><timeReceived>1:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

A career diplomat, Gould was serving as the British ambassador to Israel when he helped to launch the UK-Israel Technologies Hub - an initiative run out of the British Embassy in Tel Aviv to forge technology partnerships between UK and Israeli companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I spent a lot of time building links between the UK and Israel in tech. The Israeli tech scene is extraordinary,\" Gould says. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Israel was his last international posting - previously he had spent time in Islamabad, Washington, Manila and Tehran, during which time he was sent to negotiate the release of a group of marines and sailors who had been taken prisoner by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. (\"When you get off a plane and into a taxi and turn on the BBC News, and item number one on the worldwide news is the fact that you've just got off a plane, you feel very much like you are the centre of things and need to deliver,\" he says.) </p><p>Rather than go back to the Foreign Office when he returned to the UK in 2015, he became director of cybersecurity at the Cabinet Office - a move in part spurred by his involvement in the tech partnership in Israel, he says. </p><p>\"That in turn led me to become the government's first director general for digital policy. And then having lived it on a national and policy level, the prospect of doing it for real in a very sort of punchy way here [for the NHS] was too good an opportunity to pass up.\" </p><p>Gould became chief executive of NHSX - an organisation that sits across NHS England and the Department for Health and Social Care - last May, three months after health secretary Matt Hancock announced its creation. Its aim, according to Hancock, is to \"bring strategy, leadership and technical expertise to... the world's most exciting public sector digital transformation project\". </p><p>The role of NHSX - and its relationship to existing bodies like NHS Digital, which provides tech and information systems to support healthcare - is not yet well understood by many outside the organisation. But when PublicTechnology sister publication Civil Service World puts this to the former ambassador, he says the two have very different roles to play. </p><p>\"NHSX is the guiding mind at the centre: we are the centre for strategy, we hold the budgets, we set the policy and we commission from NHS Digital and from others like NHS Business Services Authority.\" </p><p>He refers to a speech by Hancock in January, which described NHS Digital and NHS BSA as the \"tracks down which tech runs in the NHS\". Gould adds: \"So they are the core delivery partner for health and care.\" </p><p>\"They do a lot of build, normally commissioned by us, so there is a clear distinction between our world and theirs. We haven't done a good enough job yet explaining that publicly - partly because we've been working out ourselves exactly how we want the delineation to work - but I think it is a familiar one. And I think it's useful. And I think it will be clear.\" </p><p>Data and innovation </p><p>For now, the two words the public are likeliest to associate with NHSX would be \"innovation\" and \"data\". Last year headlines declared that the innovation body had taken control of industry access to patients' data and commercial deals with the NHS. </p><p>\"I'm not sure I'd frame it quite like that,\" Gould says, choosing his words carefully. Rather, it provides policy and guidance on the use of data. NHSX is in the process of setting up a team known as the Centre for Expertise, whose job will include providing commercial and legal advice to NHS organisations signing data agreements, developing standard contracts and guidance, and advising on ensuring deals benefit the health service. </p><p>And NHSX has worked with NHS Digital and with the Office for Life Sciences - which straddles DHSC and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and which champions research, innovation and tech in healthcare - to come up with a set of principles to govern the use of patient data, including in commercial transactions. </p><p>\"In all this, we're very clear, first of all, that the privacy of patient data is absolutely paramount. We need to keep patients with us and we need to keep staff with us, so we can't do anything that erodes trust,\" Gould says. </p><p>There's a lot of stress in the system around when it's okay to share patient data, even for direct care </p><p>The principles establish, among other things, that any use of patient data must have an \"explicit aim to improve the health, welfare and/or care of patients in the NHS\"; that the terms of data-sharing agreements should include \"quantifiable and explicit benefits for patients\"; and that agreements should be transparent and must not undermine the work of the health service. </p><p>And there is one that Gould calls an \"absolute\": no hospital or trust can sign a deal giving a research group or company exclusive access to its patient data. \"Because one of the things that is most valuable about the patient data that the NHS holds, is that it is a coherent set of 55 million people's records.\" Whittling away at the whole would undermine that value, he says. </p><p>\"That's very corrosive. I don't think the public would support it, and I think it's damaging to the system. So, we've laid down that rule.\" </p><p>But CSW wonders how many members of the public need to get as far as thinking about cohorts or exclusive agreements before they start to get nervous about how their data is used. The bigger worries for many people are twofold: that they won't be given a choice over what happens to their data, and that it could be traced back to them. </p><p>These are not new worries. In 2016, the ill-fated care.data project, which was to extract anonymised records from GP surgeries into a central database, was closed after concerns about patient consent and confidentiality. But one need only look at the last year's worth of headlines to see that debate around the topic is not getting any less heated, and that some of the public already have already lost trust in what is happening to health data. In December, the Atlantic ran an article warning about the trend of big companies gathering up huge reams of health data - whether that's Apple gathering it directly through footstep and sleep trackers on people's iPhones, or Facebook's AI division working with radiologists to teach its machine-learning systems to read MRI scans. The headline? \"Everyone should be worried by big tech's huge NHS data grab.\" </p><p>What does Gould think - should everyone be worried? </p><p>\"Well, I think what I would rather frame it as is: we should make sure that whatever we do is in line with the principles that we've set out,\" Gould says. </p><p>He says polling shows that while there will be people at either end of the spectrum of attitudes to data, \"there's a large group of people in the middle... who are comfortable with their data being used to develop new treatments or therapies or whatever it is, as long as they are confident that it's being done in a way that sufficient benefit comes back to the NHS\". </p><p>Indeed, a poll commissioned last year by the National Data Guardian Dame Fiona Caldicott - who advises and challenges the health and care system on safeguarding citizens' confidential information - found about seven in 10 people in England approved of partnerships that led to benefits like access to new technologies at a reduced cost and better patient care. In other areas the respondents were more evenly split: half said private companies should share in any profit generated from the deal, or that it was fair that they could; and exactly half were happy for the NHS to receive a one-off payment for access to data. </p><p>But the question that remains unaddressed is what to do about the cohort that Gould(picture above right) readily admits \"would find it difficult to countenance their data being used for any purpose other than direct care\". </p><p>And another uncomfortable issue remains. What if the safeguards that Gould talks about don't work? </p><p>Last year, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink - part of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, through which companies can buy patient data compiled from GP surgeries and hospitals for research purposes - changed the way it described the data it was selling from \"anonymous\" to \"anonymised\". The latter means it has been through processes to de-identify the patients it comes from - but there is no rigid standard for how this should be done. </p><p>Two days before CSW meets Gould, the Observer has published claims by anonymous \"senior NHS figures\" saying patient data sold for research via CPRD could be traced back to individual medical records. </p><p>Gould says he wouldn't want to comment on that story, given that it concerns a separate government body. \"That was a particular data set belonging to a particular organisation. I wouldn't leap to a conclusion that because people have concerns, therefore it's not working.\" </p><p>But leaving aside that specific example, Gould acknowledges that when data is shared, \"there is certainly a risk, depending on what data you have, that it can be pieced together and the process of anonymisation can be reversed.\" </p><p>He adds: \"The question is, what systems and what safeguards do you have in place, so that you can be sufficiently confident that doesn't happen?\" </p><p>Seven in ten </p><p>Proportion of people in England that approve of NHS partnerships with tech firms if they improve patient care, according to a study from the National Data Guardian </p><p>1.6 million </p><p>Number of records that were shared without patient consent by the Royal Free Hospital with Google DeepMind </p><p>'User experience' </p><p>The symbolism of the 'X' in NHSX </p><p>February 2019 </p><p>Date of NHSX's creation </p><p>\u00a3250m </p><p>Money invested in creating the health service's National AI Lab </p><p>The conversation returns to those safeguards when Gould speaks about another of NHSX's areas of expertise: artificial intelligence. Last September, the agency put out a report on good practice in AI, and is now in the process of setting up the National AI Lab. </p><p>The lab - a joint venture with the Accelerated Access Collaborative, which speeds up adoption of new treatments and tech in the NHS - will fund and develop artificial intelligence technologies to tackle tough healthcare challenges. </p><p>Gould says the lab is \"starting to turn into more concrete plans\" after the initial announcement of \u00a3250m to set it up last year. It will provide grants and facilitate cross-government, industry and academic collaborations on both mature and earlier-stage AI tech. The first tranche of funding, \u00a3114m, was announced in January. </p><p>But many people have mixed feelings about AI - not least because of a scandal that erupted when Royal Free Hospital handed over 1.6 million patients' health records to DeepMind, an AI company owned by Google, without their consent. The Information Commissioner's Office later found the hospital had failed to comply with data-protection legislation. </p><p>When CSW asks what some of the safeguards around data and AI should be, Gould says: \"First of all, making sure that patient confidentiality is protected. So, the data needs to be shared in a way that does that. If you allow an algorithm to span over a data set, have you done that in a way that protects patient data or puts it at risk? It's a technical question about how you structure the access.\" </p><p>Gould also acknowledges that \"there is concern, both in the NHS and in the health tech community, that we haven't created coherent rules [for AI] that all fit together and give people the sense that there's cover for what they're doing\". </p><p>In January, he convened a roundtable with the heads of 14 regulators and agencies involved in setting those rules - among them the MHRA, the information commissioner and the Health Research Authority. There they agreed to develop a platform to improve communication and share advice; create a regulatory \"sandbox\" where AI tech can be tested; and identify any gaps in regulation. </p><p>Gould is keen to realise what he says has been a long-held belief that \"smart, innovation-friendly regulation that keeps citizens safe\" will give the UK a competitive edge internationally. In other words, rules must be in place, but must not be so stringent that they \"strangle the technology\". </p><p>One risk the regulators will consider has become something of a ministerial talking point ever since then-PM Theresa May warned in Davos in 2018 that public bodies must ensure \"algorithms don't perpetuate the human biases of their developers\". She said the government's new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation must tackle this. </p><p>Gould was on the team that set up the data-ethics centre in his previous role as director general for digital and media policy in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, \"so it's an area of thought that I've sort of brought with me to this job,\" he says. He wants AI to be used to tackle health inequalities, not worsen them. </p><p>\"We're super mindful of the risks. There's no easy answer other than making sure that in regulation and practice, how we distribute resources and everything we do, the risks of exclusion, algorithmic bias and unintended consequences have been properly thought about, and we're doing it in a way that mitigates against those risks.\" </p><p>In October, NHSX published a report entitled \"Artificial intelligence: how to get it right\" setting out a framework for governance, models of \"good AI\" and guidelines for international best practice. </p><p>It's important to get this right because AI has huge potential benefits for the NHS, Gould says: \"One of the exciting things about this is that some of the more mature and proven AI systems are precisely in those areas where the NHS has some of its most acute clinical shortages.\" AI programmes have been developed to read mammograms, and work with DeepMind at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has led to a breakthrough tool to improve referrals for eye disease. </p><p>And there is also a wealth of non-clinical AI applications that could save the NHS time and money, Gould adds. A doctor at University College London Hospital has developed a system to predict when someone is likely to miss an appointment, which can then be used to send out prompts. </p><p>Gould is quick to point out that NHSX has another - rather less controversial - strand of work on data sharing, within the health service itself. </p><p>\"There's a lot of stress in the system around when it's okay to share patient data, even for direct care,\" he says. </p><p>In his early days in the role, Gould visited hospitals, GP surgeries and mental-health trusts and found that while it was technically possible to transfer patients' records from one of these bodies to another, it often wasn't happening because people were nervous about what would happen if they mistakenly shared the wrong data. Overwhelmed by seemingly conflicting guidance from different authorities, \"some people have got a bit paralysed\", he says. </p><p>NHSX is using what Gould calls its \"convening power at the centre\" to work with the National Data Guardian, the Information Commissioner's Office and NHS Digital to simplify the guidance \"so that people know when it's safe to share and do so\". He adds that this is a way NHSX \"can directly impact on patient care and patient outcomes.\" </p><p>Gould became familiar with these data blockages on a personal level when his wife underwent treatment for breast cancer last year. </p><p>\"She was treated in four places, all local, none of which could speak to any of the others. She would have to carry around her scans, all her details, her test results; she would very often go and see the oncologist, who wouldn't be able to call up the results of the scans that he had ordered.\" </p><p>And Gould points out that not everyone can do that. \"It's infuriating when you're in control of it; it's heartbreaking when the patient isn't in a state to be able to provide their own interoperability.\" He recalls visiting a hospice outside Manchester, where staff found themselves unable to access records for the patients in their care. </p><p>\"That's heartbreaking, when you think that these people who are trying to care for patients at their most vulnerable are doing so with a hand tied behind their back because we haven't found a way to make sure that the information about the patient can flow in the way that it needs to,\" he says. </p><p>\"This just is not the best, most efficient, safest way to run the system. If we can help with that, through creating clarity around the rules so that the data can flow, creating shared care records so that technically it's possible, having both technical standards, but also standards for how we describe different things so that systems can speak to each other - I think that will probably be the single most useful thing NHSX does.\" </p><p>As well as drawing on his own experiences and visits to health providers, Gould says he values patients' perspectives on the health service. </p><p>In November, he announced NHSX was seeking two citizens to act as part-time advisers to ensure \"the patient voice is properly built into everything we do\". The agency will consult them during the conception, design, and development of new services. </p><p>We're very clear, first of all, that the privacy of patient data is absolutely paramount; we need to keep patients with us and we need to keep staff with us, so we can't do anything that erodes trust </p><p>Asked where the idea comes from, he says the \"X\" in the organisation's name stands for \"user experience\". </p><p>\"One of our guiding principles is it's all about user need. It's really easy in a big system to lock yourself away at the centre and come up with the answers. But actually, we won't get that right unless we are talking to users, and we're listening to patients, listening to staff and listening to people at the front line.\" </p><p>Every project should have a \"patient voice\" represented, he says, as well as the rigorous user research that already takes place. Otherwise, it's too easy to get caught up in what an organisation thinks patients need, even if that does not quite align with what they actually need. </p><p>\"Because ultimately, this is not about the tech. It's not even about the data. It's about patients. It's about the citizens. And, so, having those people who will make sure that in everything we do, we are focused on that and we remember why we're doing it and we skew what we do to the patient, I think can only be a good thing.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PBTNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PBTNET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJG-R611-F0JV-80RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3076\"/><timeReceived>12:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PublicTechnology (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 31, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp;

A career diplomat, Gould was serving as the British ambassador to Israel when he helped to launch the UK-Israel Technologies Hub - an initiative run out of the British Embassy in Tel Aviv to forge technology partnerships between UK and Israeli companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I spent a lot of time building links between the UK and Israel in tech. The Israeli tech scene is extraordinary,\" Gould says. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Israel was his last international posting - previously he had spent time in Islamabad, Washington, Manila and Tehran, during which time he was sent to negotiate the release of a group of marines and sailors who had been taken prisoner by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. (\"When you get off a plane and into a taxi and turn on the BBC News, and item number one on the worldwide news is the fact that you've just got off a plane, you feel very much like you are the centre of things and need to deliver,\" he says.) </p><p>RELATED CONTENT </p><p> Andrew Greenway: How GDS conquered the world </p><p> Interview: GDS head Alison Pritchard on ministerial change, the spending review and the benefits of comedy </p><p> Did the Government Transformation Strategy point the way to the future? </p><p>Rather than go back to the Foreign Office when he returned to the UK in 2015, he became director of cybersecurity at the Cabinet Office - a move in part spurred by his involvement in the tech partnership in Israel, he says. </p><p>\"That in turn led me to become the government's first director general for digital policy. And then having lived it on a national and policy level, the prospect of doing it for real in a very sort of punchy way here [for the NHS] was too good an opportunity to pass up.\" </p><p>Gould became chief executive of NHSX - an organisation that sits across NHS England and the Department for Health and Social Care - last May, three months after health secretary Matt Hancock announced its creation. Its aim, according to Hancock, is to \"bring strategy, leadership and technical expertise to... the world's most exciting public sector digital transformation project\". </p><p>The role of NHSX - and its relationship to existing bodies like NHS Digital, which provides tech and information systems to support healthcare - is not yet well understood by many outside the organisation. But when CSW puts this to the former ambassador, he says the two have very different roles to play. </p><p>\"NHSX is the guiding mind at the centre: we are the centre for strategy, we hold the budgets, we set the policy and we commission from NHS Digital and from others like NHS Business Services Authority.\" </p><p>He refers to a speech by Hancock in January, which described NHS Digital and NHS BSA as the \"tracks down which tech runs in the NHS\". Gould adds: \"So they are the core delivery partner for health and care.\" </p><p>\"They do a lot of build, normally commissioned by us, so there is a clear distinction between our world and theirs. We haven't done a good enough job yet explaining that publicly - partly because we've been working out ourselves exactly how we want the delineation to work - but I think it is a familiar one. And I think it's useful. And I think it will be clear.\" </p><p>For now, the two words the public are likeliest to associate with NHSX would be \"innovation\" and \"data\". Last year headlines declared that the innovation body had taken control of industry access to patients' data and commercial deals with the NHS. </p><p>\"I'm not sure I'd frame it quite like that,\" Gould says, choosing his words carefully. Rather, it provides policy and guidance on the use of data. NHSX is in the process of setting up a team known as the Centre for Expertise, whose job will include providing commercial and legal advice to NHS organisations signing data agreements, developing standard contracts and guidance, and advising on ensuring deals benefit the health service. </p><p>And NHSX has worked with NHS Digital and with the Office for Life Sciences - which straddles DHSC and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and which champions research, innovation and tech in healthcare - to come up with a set of principles to govern the use of patient data, including in commercial transactions. </p><p>\"In all this, we're very clear, first of all, that the privacy of patient data is absolutely paramount. We need to keep patients with us and we need to keep staff with us, so we can't do anything that erodes trust,\" Gould says. </p><p>\"People who are trying to care for patients at their most vulnerable are doing so with a hand tied behind their back because we haven't found a way to make sure that the information about the patient can flow in the way that it needs to\" </p><p>The principles establish, among other things, that any use of patient data must have an \"explicit aim to improve the health, welfare and/or care of patients in the NHS\"; that the terms of data-sharing agreements should include \"quantifiable and explicit benefits for patients\"; and that agreements should be transparent and must not undermine the work of the health service. </p><p>And there is one that Gould calls an \"absolute\": no hospital or trust can sign a deal giving a research group or company exclusive access to its patient data. \"Because one of the things that is most valuable about the patient data that the NHS holds, is that it is a coherent set of 55 million people's records.\" Whittling away at the whole would undermine that value, he says. </p><p>\"That's very corrosive. I don't think the public would support it, and I think it's damaging to the system. So we've laid down that rule.\" </p><p>But CSW wonders how many members of the public need to get as far as thinking about cohorts or exclusive agreements before they start to get nervous about how their data is used. The bigger worries for many people are twofold: that they won't be given a choice over what happens to their data, and that it could be traced back to them. </p><p>These aren't new worries. In 2016, the ill-fated care.data project, which was to extract anonymised records from GP surgeries into a central database, was closed after concerns about patient consent and confidentiality. But one need only look at the last year's worth of headlines to see that debate around the topic is not getting any less heated, and that some of the public already have already lost trust in what is happening to health data. In December, the Atlantic ran an article warning about the trend of big companies gathering up huge reams of health data - whether that's Apple gathering it directly through footstep and sleep trackers on people's iPhones, or Facebook's AI division working with radiologists to teach its machine-learning systems to read MRI scans. The headline? \"Everyone should be worried by big tech's huge NHS data grab.\" </p><p>What does Gould think - should everyone be worried? \"Well, I think what I would rather frame it as is: we should make sure that whatever we do is in line with the principles that we've set out,\" Gould says. </p><p>He says polling shows that while there will be people at either end of the spectrum of attitudes to data, \"there's a large group of people in the middle... who are comfortable with their data being used to develop new treatments or therapies or whatever it is, as long as they are confident that it's being done in a way that sufficient benefit comes back to the NHS\". </p><p>Indeed, a poll commissioned last year by the National Data Guardian Dame Fiona Caldicott - who advises and challenges the health and care system on safeguarding citizens' confidential information - found about seven in 10 people in England approved of partnerships that led to benefits like access to new technologies at a reduced cost and better patient care. In other areas the respondents were more evenly split: half said private companies should share in any profit generated from the deal, or that it was fair that they could; and exactly half were happy for the NHS to receive a one-off payment for access to data. </p><p>But the question that remains unaddressed is what to do about the cohort that Gould readily admits \"would find it difficult to countenance their data being used for any purpose other than direct care\". And another uncomfortable issue remains. What if the safeguards that Gould talks about don't work? </p><p>Last year, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink - part of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, through which companies can buy patient data compiled from GP surgeries and hospitals for research purposes - changed the way it described the data it was selling from \"anonymous\" to \"anonymised\". The latter means it has been through processes to de-identify the patients it comes from - but there is no rigid standard for how this should be done. </p><p>Two days before CSW meets Gould, the Observer has published claims by anonymous \"senior NHS figures\" saying patient data sold for research via CPRD could be traced back to individual medical records. </p><p>Gould says he wouldn't want to comment on that story, given that it concerns a separate government body. \"That was a particular data set belonging to a particular organisation. I wouldn't leap to a conclusion that because people have concerns, therefore it's not working.\" </p><p>But leaving aside that specific example, Gould acknowledges that when data is shared, \"there is certainly a risk, depending on what data you have, that it can be pieced together and the process of anonymisation can be reversed.\" </p><p>He adds: \"The question is, what systems and what safeguards do you have in place, so that you can be sufficiently confident that doesn't happen?\" </p><p>The conversation returns to those safeguards when Gould speaks about another of NHSX's areas of expertise: artificial intelligence. Last September, the agency put out a report on good practice in AI, and is now in the process of setting up the National AI Lab. </p><p>The lab - a joint venture with the Accelerated Access Collaborative, which speeds up adoption of new treatments and tech in the NHS - will fund and develop artificial intelligence technologies to tackle tough healthcare challenges. </p><p>Gould says the lab is \"starting to turn into more concrete plans\" after the initial announcement of \u00a3250m to set it up last year. It will provide grants and facilitate cross-government, industry and academic collaborations on both mature and earlier-stage AI tech. The first tranche of funding, \u00a3114m, was announced in January. </p><p>But many people have mixed feelings about AI - not least because of a scandal that erupted when Royal Free Hospital handed over 1.6 million patients' health records to DeepMind, an AI company owned by Google, without their consent. The Information Commissioner's Office later found the hospital had failed to comply with data-protection legislation. </p><p>When CSW asks what some of the safeguards around data and AI should be, Gould says: \"First of all, making sure that patient confidentiality is protected. So the data needs to be shared in a way that does that. If you allow an algorithm to span over a data set, have you done that in a way that protects patient data or puts it at risk? It's a technical question about how you structure the access.\" </p><p>Gould also acknowledges that \"there is concern, both in the NHS and in the health tech community, that we haven't created coherent rules [for AI] that all fit together and give people the sense that there's cover for what they're doing\". </p><p>In January, he convened a roundtable with the heads of 14 regulators and agencies involved in setting those rules - among them the MHRA, the information commissioner and the Health Research Authority. There they agreed to develop a platform to improve communication and share advice; create a regulatory \"sandbox\" where AI tech can be tested; and identify any gaps in regulation. </p><p>Gould is keen to realise what he says has been a long-held belief that \"smart, innovation-friendly regulation that keeps citizens safe\" will give the UK a competitive edge internationally. In other words, rules must be in place, but must not be so stringent that they \"strangle the technology\". </p><p>One risk the regulators will consider has become something of a ministerial talking point ever since then-PM Theresa May warned in Davos in 2018 that public bodies must ensure \"algorithms don't perpetuate the human biases of their developers\". She said the government's new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation must tackle this. </p><p>Gould was on the team that set up the data-ethics centre in his previous role as director general for digital and media policy in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, \"so it's an area of thought that I've sort of brought with me to this job,\" he says. He wants AI to be used to tackle health inequalities, not worsen them. </p><p>\"We're super mindful of the risks. There's no easy answer other than making sure that in regulation and practice, how we distribute resources and everything we do, the risks of exclusion, algorithmic bias and unintended consequences have been properly thought about, and we're doing it in a way that mitigates against those risks.\" </p><p>In October, NHSX published a report entitled \"Artificial intelligence: how to get it right\" setting out a framework for governance, models of \"good AI\" and guidelines for international best practice. </p><p>It's important to get this right because AI has huge potential benefits for the NHS, Gould says: \"One of the exciting things about this is that some of the more mature and proven AI systems are precisely in those areas where the NHS has some of its most acute clinical shortages.\" AI programmes have been developed to read mammograms, and work with DeepMind at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has led to a breakthrough tool to improve referrals for eye disease. </p><p>And there is also a wealth of non-clinical AI applications that could save the NHS time and money, Gould adds. A doctor at University College London Hospital has developed a system to predict when someone is likely to miss an appointment, which can then be used to send out prompts. </p><p>\"It's really easy in a big system to lock yourself away at the centre and come up with the answers. But we won't get that right unless we listen to patients\" </p><p>Gould is quick to point out that NHSX has another - rather less controversial - strand of work on data sharing, within the health service itself. \"There's a lot of stress in the system around when it's okay to share patient data, even for direct care,\" he says. </p><p>In his early days in the role, Gould visited hospitals, GP surgeries and mental-health trusts and found that while it was technically possible to transfer patients' records from one of these bodies to another, it often wasn't happening because people were nervous about what would happen if they mistakenly shared the wrong data. Overwhelmed by seemingly conflicting guidance from different authorities, \"some people have got a bit paralysed\", he says. </p><p>NHSX is using what Gould calls its \"convening power at the centre\" to work with the National Data Guardian, the Information Commissioner's Office and NHS Digital to simplify the guidance \"so that people know when it's safe to share and do so\". He adds that this is a way NHSX \"can directly impact on patient care and patient outcomes.\" </p><p>Gould became familiar with these data blockages on a personal level when his wife underwent treatment for breast cancer last year. \"She was treated in four places, all local, none of which could speak to any of the others. She would have to carry around her scans, all her details, her test results; she would very often go and see the oncologist, who wouldn't be able to call up the results of the scans that he had ordered.\" </p><p>And Gould points out that not everyone can do that. \"It's infuriating when you're in control of it; it's heart breaking when the patient isn't in a state to be able to provide their own interoperability.\" He recalls visiting a hospice outside Manchester, where staff found themselves unable to access records for the patients in their care. </p><p>\"That's heart breaking, when you think that these people who are trying to care for patients at their most vulnerable are doing so with a hand tied behind their back because we haven't found a way to make sure that the information about the patient can flow in the way that it needs to,\" he says. </p><p>\"This just is not the best, most efficient, safest way to run the system. If we can help with that, through creating clarity around the rules so that the data can flow, creating shared care records so that technically it's possible, having both technical standards, but also standards for how we describe different things so that systems can speak to each other - I think that will probably be the single most useful thing NHSX does.\" </p><p>As well as drawing on his own experiences and visits to health providers, Gould says he values patients' perspectives on the health service. </p><p>In November, he announced NHSX was seeking two citizens to act as part-time advisers to ensure \"the patient voice is properly built into everything we do\". The agency will consult them during the conception, design, and development of new services. </p><p>Asked where the idea comes from, he says the \"X\" in the organisation's name stands for \"user experience\". </p><p>\"One of our guiding principles is it's all about user need. It's really easy in a big system to lock yourself away at the centre and come up with the answers. But actually, we won't get that right unless we are talking to users, and we're listening to patients, listening to staff and listening to people at the front line.\" </p><p>Every project should have a \"patient voice\" represented, he says, as well as the rigorous user research that already takes place. Otherwise, it's too easy to get caught up in what an organisation thinks patients need, even if that doesn't quite align with what they actually do need. </p><p>\"Because ultimately, this is not about the tech. It's not even about the data. It's about patients. It's about the citizens. And so having those people who will make sure that in everything we do, we are focused on that and we remember why we're doing it and we skew what we do to the patient, I think can only be a good thing.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVSCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVSCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHN-13S1-F0JV-82N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3039\"/><timeReceived>11:39 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Civil Service World (online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 27, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp;

He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior Fellow at the Center for European state at Harvard. He is also the Author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower. Networks empower from the Freemasons to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Niall, thanks so much for joining us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Great to be here.</p><p>FU: So we were just talking with Mike about President Trump and the looming government shutdown, if that happens. I want to start first with the presidency with you because in the past, you have called his presidency a comedy rather than a tragedy.</p><p>We've seen the administration scramble to perhaps a government shutdown, while at the same time saying may be a shutdown will be good. No matter what happens though, the base and his support is still there. Is it a wise move for the President right now to be pinning everything on the base staying with him as he touts the economy doing well and the stock market doing well, that can all go up in flames very quickly?</p><p>FERGUSON: It could. We all know that financial markets have a way of surprising that the bull market is forever. And there have been many people, my colleague at Harvard Martin Feldstein just this weekend in the general who've warned that a correction could come along and spoil that post of Donald Trumps argument.</p><p>But on the other hand if you look at that approval rating of his, it has not been taking off in the last few --</p><p>FU: From a little bit.</p><p>FERGUSON: From a historic a little bit. Remember he was the most unpopular President at the outset, since polling began. And he didn't get any more popular in his first year. But you begin to see the possible inflection point here as the economic good news just keeps on coming in. Plus it's a point that Trump is getting some wins on foreign policy, there aren't really anything like enough airtime.</p><p>I mean, he can change the policy in Iran and by the end of last year. Iran was in a state of upheaval. He took a much tougher line on North Korea. And now guess what, the North Korean's and South Korean's are making nice with one another.</p><p>So, one of the things that ordered by the Trump Presidencies is the way that he tend to shoot himself with that Twitter feed of his. And if he tweeted less and said fewer off the cuff races things that shocked so many peoples unjustly, we would be focusing more on the outcomes. We'd be focusing more on what's actually getting done.</p><p>And I think that would in fact reflect much better on him.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Do you think he's undermining he's own success?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I think the strategy is come up in raging liberal by being outrageous has one benefit. That is that seems to force Democrats to the left. And I think on sees (ph) this on the immigration issue. It's quite good from a Republicans strategic point of few, if the Democrats become more and more committed to sanctuary cities to the undocumented.</p><p>A lot of Republicans don't feel good about that at all. But my sense is that the cost and benefits of the President's populist outrage are kind of finally poised at this point. And I'm not sure he's necessary net better off with some of the most outrageous things that he said of late.</p><p>I think if he'd said much less over the last let say 12 months. And focus more on the achievements, he'd be riding higher in the polls.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think we've seen the loads as far as the politics concerns because as many aspects now already short-term and longer-term are playing to his favor, if we keep the tweeting aside?</p><p>FERGUSON: Right. I mean, one of the things I've tried to argue in The Square and the Tower is that we have a new kind of politics.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>FERGUSON: Which some of the still struggling to get ahead around is the public spear that's no longer dominated by network television, that's increasingly dominated by social media and the President has shown himself to have much better understanding not just the Twitter but the Facebook than his political rivals.</p><p>So one thing I did learn over two years of thinking and writing about Donald Trump is don't underestimate him and don't make the mistake of judging him by conventional measure. One thing I did recently was to just to run an experiment. I ask myself leaving aside personalities.</p><p>What presidency is this dislike? I mean this like the first year of Nixon and a lots of people have drawn that parallel, there's a lot of Democrats who would love this to be Watergate all over again is even the movie by Spielberg and go watch, you'd fantasize that.</p><p>You know, the Washington Post bringing down Donald Trump. It's not really like Nixon's first year at all, its much more like Bill Clinton first year. Go back and read woodward the agenda, change the names and you can have the version of what we've seen in the last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're going to talk more about (INAUDIBLE) Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're back with Niall Ferguson.

So we were just talking before about the sort of fundamental basis of this book and what it means and actually where Donald Trump sits in between the interplay between hierarchies in history and social network.</p><p>And how they've evolved overtime, he is someone who harness in a unique way like thinking political terms at least at that point in time, the power of social network and what that mean for democracy.</p><p>.FERGUSON: Well, in someway in the Brexit referendum was like the over the chart of the main show in 2016 because the leave campaign used Facebook as an advertising tool and just the way of the Trump campaign did.</p><p>But this book is about showing how social networks have always been there. It's not like Marks (ph) of Caberg (ph) invented them. All that Facebook did was to make them bigger and faster than they ever were before. But throughout history there have been periods when a new networks have come along and disrupted established hierarchies, those big tower of power that usually rule.</p><p>And my favorite example is from 500 years ago when the printing press completely disrupted European politics, causes the reformation Martin Luther without the printing press would just been birth at the state like hierarchy (ph). And we've never averted him.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When you got the day off on Monday.</p><p>FERGUSON: It's true. So that certain that's another Martin Luther, that Martin the King introvertly and so had a social network, in the civil rights wouldn't have work if they haven't been this network of churches in the South that had the people organized and should cancel their commitment when it came to often very hazardous demonstration.</p><p>Social networks all that you don't need the internet to have them. All we've done is making them bigger and faster and I think more powerful than they've been certainly anytime in the last 400 or 300 years.</p><p>FU: And easier to corrupt as well, because of the platform.</p><p>FERGUSON: Right, this is the problem that makes it different from the age of printing press. There wasn't one person who owned over printing press is in 16th or 17th century Europe whereas social networks today are very concentrated and their ownership.</p><p>And this point of view, it's kind of extraordinary, these quasi-monopolies that have emerged online and seach, you've got Google retail, you've got Amazon, and of course in social media we've got Facebook.</p><p>This is extraordinary power. Facebook is the biggest content publisher in all of history. Zuckerberg is more powerful than William Randolph Hearst or Rupert Murdoch, any previous proprietor of the media organization.</p><p>And yet, Facebook is regulated as if it's a tech platform, not a content publisher. And that seem to me an extraordinary anomaly considering that 45 percent of Americans are getting their news from Facebook.</p><p>FU: Facebook is also reluctant to take on mental (ph) of assuming responsibility, should they?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Also now.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, they're indeed. And it's one of the key arguments that I think will play out in the coming years. Is it a content publisher? If it is, should it be liable for all the content that appears and the content, his vast in his content (ph).</p><p>I mean every now and then they'll say that they're hiring 10,000 people to bet the content. I mean come on the sheer scale of the content that is if you're Facebook he's going to require many, many more than 10,000 fact checkers.</p><p>I think this us a big issue. A lot of discussion on the big tech companies recently has been about anti-trust. I think that is a complete red herring. These are natural monopolies, you couldn't break them up. It's not going to happen. And the law, I don't think would support antitrust actions against these companies.</p><p>But I think the exemptions from liability for content that we're establishing mid 1990's when Facebook didn't even exist, those look like a vulnerability and I would just surprise if legislators and regulators begun to ask questions about that in the coming months</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about for somebody like Amazon and the power that they continue to accrue or Google for that matter? Like who disrupts the ultimate disruptive that they've been in such a small space of time.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, if I were Jeff Bezos, I wish I were. But I would be worried much more about my rivals in Asia. I'd be looking at Alibaba, I'd be looking at Jack Ma and I'd be thinking, you know, I thought I was going to own the rest of world and you would just of China.</p><p>I begin to wonder and I just was Hang Joe (ph) looking at what's going on. Alibaba could it be that the big Chinese tech companies are about to make a push for market share outside of China, and we might find the U.S. companies beginning to lose that. That would be my worry at Amazon.</p><p>FU: Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is going to stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk a bit more now about Bitcoin. We're back with Niall Ferguson. He says Bitcoin mega pot but the revolution will go on.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I said that when it was around about I think 1900 and it did go drop (ph). I have to tell about the story --</p><p>FU: You should be trading.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I don't know. The first thing should be trading is my son. So when he's 15th, it's now 18th now some back he said to me \"Dad, you really should buy Bitcoin.\" And pompously I Professor Ferguson says \"Young man, what do you know about financial history, this can never work. And I would call Jamie Dimon I almost said tulips (ph).</p><p>Well, I kind of learn the hard way. He was right. And I can got -- that caught up last year and began to really think about this. And we're amidst of an Amazing financial revolution which isn't just about Bitcoin. It's about Blockchain generally and what Blockchain can do.</p><p>I think a lot of people have got, you got confused by the term cryptocurrency. And because I'm not sure that we're going to produce a new form of money this way. But we have produced, what Bitcoin has produced is, number one, a new kind of store of value and may be more importantly a speculative object with more volatility than any other financial market. And, you know, for some people that's attractive including my son.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Three years ago, he was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FERGUSON: Like $350 (ph) was the price. If I had listen to him I wouldn't have to run around New York City doing institute like, you know, I've been (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does he still own it?</p><p>FERGUSON: I wish, he would say not nearly enough because don't think he landscape (ph) in the room to make a message something like three.</p><p>FU: Wow (INAUDIBLE). But on paper he's doing pretty well right now. He reminds me of this on a regular basis. I mean the correction interesting. I had one thing that I came to see last year was that there would a correction because it has a classic bubble quality to it.</p><p>All those ICOs that initial coin offering were plastic bubbles. On territory a lot of it almost certainly fraudulent but I must say, I decided that 10,000 was the entry point. So when it went below 10, this week, I'm afraid I became a buyer.</p><p>FU: Wow, for disclosure. Niall Ferguson, Bitcoin owner.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, only my son's advice.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. Now we have to see Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: Now still with us, is Niall Ferguson, he's new book \"The Square and the Tower\" looks at tensions in Silicon Valley between hierarchies and networks. And of course, not just in Silicon Valley but in countries and societies around the world.</p><p>Niall, let's talk a little bit about Uber here because is this a network in a same way that Facebook is a network or Twitter is a network? Or is it just a very narrow business in which Travis Kalanick has been able to ride the Silicon Valley wave?</p><p>FERGUSON: It was definitely a network business and ride sharing (ph) was a classic example of what you could do with what people called society market, the goal was to establish just the kind of dominance that had been established by Facebook and social network, Google and search et cetera.</p><p>And I think what's important here. I've read the story that you just talked about. It's not just the missteps Travis Kalanick made personally. It's also the fact that, I think he personified a certain Silicon Valley arrogance that I use to characterize as resistance is futile.</p><p>The attitude was, we have this awesome app, there's no point standing in our way. We will take the world one city at the time. And I can remember talking. We've seen another about this saying, you know, what is going to be different in Berlin. It's going to be different in China.</p><p>And indeed I write in the book about why it was the ultimately Uber lost the battle in China to Didi, which is an amazing story. And a typical story of what is going on in the world today, because these race if you like for dominance of these two sided markets is a race that's been run not just by U.S. companies but also by Chinese companies.</p><p>By the way, not by European companies, very interesting that Europe hasn't produced really any technology giants. And I think this races to relatively early stage. It's not clear who will really be dominant for example in global online retail 10 years from now. And my hunch is it won't necessarily be Amazon.</p><p>If you go talk to the people at Alibaba, they'll say we have a better understanding of emerging markets and we're going to own not just china, we're going to own Eurasia, and then move on to Africa and Latin America and leave you guys the United States, that would be a really remarkable turn of events that it happened.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do point that Travis though seems to be making, would be seemingly making to you that there was a regulator that so far behind.</p><p>The technology innovation go so fast, that actually they've got a potential hit and move into all these different markets.</p><p>FERGUSON: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And not necessarily worry so much. At one point in the story he was on his knees calling saying, I'm so terrible. He then jump up to go back into that meeting and was that, we have a P.R. problem. That there's no cultural problem there, we have a P.R. problem. At what point is that relevant for such a huge network and so many networks around the world that we have.</p><p>FERGUSON: I think that's a very Silicon Valley response to a problem. And it's not yet that different from the way Facebook initially responded when people started to say, hey, you know, you played something of a destabilizing role in the 2016 election.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg initial reaction was, the idea that fake news on Facebook had anything to do with this result is crazy. Well, of course, the tone quickly changed but at first the response is always, we have a P.R. problem, go fix the P.R., rather than recognizing. But sometimes the problems are very fundamental.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So respond or break?</p><p>FERGUSON: I think there has to be a bigger response than we've seen so far. These companies have become enormously powerful with huge markets shares. I don't think there's ever going to be a successful breakup. I think antitrust won't work.</p><p>But I do think we need to think about the implications, particularly in the realm of our public sphere, of having a very small number of companies dominating online advertising, you know, Mike Bloomberg himself said just last year there has to be some liability for the content that these network platform produce.</p><p>I agree with that wholeheartedly. It's an anomaly that the biggest content publishers are being regulated as they just tech companies. And I think you're right. The regulators are behind as they are with Bitcoin, as they're with cryptocurrency.</p><p>But history tells us that no matter how rapidly a network grows, the regulators, the government eventually catches up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But the network itself has a backlash go with Didi Uber (INAUDIBLE). Where network itself then that was responds and try to politic change.</p><p>FERGUSON: And there is something about backlash for Facebook too, just beginning to make itself felt.</p><p>FU: Right. Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you for that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Still with us Niall Ferguson and just being that's going to be an interesting vote in Pennsylvania for Trump here.</p><p>FERGUSON: Absolutely, Pennsylvania a key state for him in 2016. It's a place where he'll be looking to mobilize those voters as he turn back in November.</p><p>FU: Why do you think his popularity is still so high? There's so much resilience there, even as we talk earlier about his missteps, for instance sounding off on Twitter, making these comments that don't help him, where he shoots himself in the foot.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, somewhere around about a third, maybe for 35 percent and may be 40 percent of voters are very solidly pro Trump. And I don't think it's just his larger than life personality. There was content to Trump's campaign. Sometimes this is forgotten in all the discussion.</p><p>FU: But the content changes a lot.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, but the message when he ran was I'm going to do something about immigration, I'm going to do something about trade, free trade. I'm also going to tackle the perception that Washington is corrupt and it's a swamp.</p><p>And I think those votes were attracted by that message are prepared to cut Donald Trump an awful lot of slack as long as they feel that he is still roughly pointing in that direction and as long as they feel that he connects with them.</p><p>And I do think his ability to connect with people in Middle America, considering the man is a wealthy New York real estate developer by origin is amazing. But it's real. And I think that's the key, his ability to talk to them in the sometimes off-color language that they relate to.</p><p>So those people are not going to defect, and from the Republican establishment's point of view, they can't deserve Donald Trump. You can't give away a third of the electorate.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. The question is, can he do anything wrong in their eyes. We're going to come back to this conversation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're back with Niall Ferguson. The author of \"The Square and the Tower\". Trump in Davos, how's that going to g?</p><p>FERGUSON: It won't go that bad. I mean, they're going to talk to him with rough legs, are they? It's Davos, he's the president that Klaus Schwab will be polite. They'll be plenty of applause. I guess he'll give a speech somewhat like his Warsaw speech. And I'll be OK.</p><p>I mean, Davos hate Trump and what he stands for.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He's antithesis (ph) of the Davos.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes. I mean he basically hates some globalization and that's what they're about. On the other hand he's powerful. He's the President of the United States and Davos also like power. So I thin -- he'll get kind of polite somewhat frosty reception.</p><p>But I think the interesting thing about Davos is that it is the network of network. I mean that's where people go who live to network. And it's the very high end network. The question will be, what will go on behind the scene, I don't really care about the speeches and sessions. What's important at Davos is the meetings.</p><p>FU: Who's at piano bar at midnight?</p><p>FERGUSON: Correct. And I know suppose Trump will there. At lease his handlers where he want him to be at the piano bar at midnight. But may be interesting meetings going on back stage in those meetings rooms and some of the big hotels.</p><p>The interesting to see that any of the leaders, the European leaders for example Macron will be there. The French President Emmanuel Macron, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They going to meet with Trump. If anything going to get done, that's for me the interesting point.</p><p>FU: What's the most important meeting for him do you think?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I think that if you think back to the way Macron played him with that eternal handshake, the longest handshake in diplomatic history.</p><p>FU: We've already seen that.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, the question really is can Macron help Trump in Europe. Trump is deeply unpopular in Europe even more unpopular than in Manhattan harder that is to believe. And yet, Trump is actually being winning on the key issue, which is being European contribution to NATO. He's kind of won that argument, they had to fold because he was right.</p><p>I sense there's a possibility that relationship with France can yield something for the United States and compensate for Trump's deep on popularity amongst European population.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There some little bit of bromance there.</p><p>FERGUSON: Definitely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Niall Ferguson author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you so much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and  a Senior Fellow at the Center for European state at Harvard.  He is also  the Author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower.  Networks empower  from the Freemasons to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Niall, thanks so much for joining us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE:  Great to be here.</p><p> FU:  So we were just talking with Mike about President Trump and the  looming government shutdown, if that happens.  I want to start first with  the presidency with you because in the past, you have called his presidency  a comedy rather than a tragedy.</p><p> We've seen the administration scramble to perhaps a government shutdown,  while at the same time saying may be a shutdown will be good.  No matter  what happens though, the base and his support is still there.  Is it a wise  move for the President right now to be pinning everything on the base  staying with him as he touts the economy doing well and the stock market  doing well, that can all go up in flames very quickly?</p><p> FERGUSON:  It could.  We all know that financial markets have a way of  surprising that the bull market is forever.  And there have been many  people, my colleague at Harvard Martin Feldstein just this weekend in the  general who've warned that a correction could come along and spoil that  post of Donald Trumps argument.</p><p> But on the other hand if you look at that approval rating of his, it has  not been taking off in the last few --</p><p> FU:  From a little bit.</p><p> FERGUSON:  From a historic a little bit.  Remember he was the most  unpopular President at the outset, since polling began.  And he didn't get  any more popular in his first year.  But you begin to see the possible  inflection point here as the economic good news just keeps on coming in.   Plus it's a point that Trump is getting some wins on foreign policy, there  aren't really anything like enough airtime.</p><p> I mean, he can change the policy in Iran and by the end of last year.  Iran  was in a state of upheaval.  He took a much tougher line on North Korea.   And now guess what, the North Korean's and South Korean's are making nice  with one another.</p><p> So, one of the things that ordered by the Trump Presidencies is the way  that he tend to shoot himself with that Twitter feed of his.  And if he  tweeted less and said fewer off the cuff races things that shocked so many  peoples unjustly, we would be focusing more on the outcomes.  We'd be  focusing more on what's actually getting done.</p><p> And I think  that would in fact reflect much better on him.</p><p> JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Do you think he's undermining he's own  success?</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, I think the strategy is come up in raging liberal by being  outrageous has one benefit.  That is that seems to force Democrats to the  left.  And I think on sees (ph) this on the immigration issue.  It's quite  good from a Republicans strategic point of few, if the Democrats become  more and more committed to sanctuary cities to the undocumented.</p><p> A lot of Republicans don't feel good about that at all.  But my sense is  that the cost and benefits of the President's populist outrage are kind of  finally poised at this point.  And I'm not sure he's necessary net better  off with some of the most outrageous things that he said of late.</p><p> I think if he'd said much less over the last let say 12 months.  And focus  more on the achievements, he'd be riding higher in the polls.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Do you think we've seen the loads as far as the politics  concerns because as many aspects now already short-term and longer-term are  playing to his favor, if we keep the tweeting aside?</p><p> FERGUSON:  Right.  I mean, one of the things I've tried to argue in The  Square and the Tower is that we have a new kind of politics.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Right.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Which some of the still struggling to get ahead around is the  public spear that's no longer dominated by network television, that's  increasingly dominated by social media and the President has shown himself  to have much better understanding not just the Twitter but the  Facebook  than his political rivals.</p><p> So one thing I did learn over two years of thinking and writing about  Donald Trump is don't underestimate him and don't make the mistake of  judging him by conventional measure.  One thing I did recently was to just  to run an experiment.  I ask myself leaving aside personalities.</p><p> What presidency is this dislike?  I mean this like the first year of Nixon  and a lots of people have drawn that parallel, there's a lot of Democrats  who would love this to be Watergate all over again is even the movie by  Spielberg and go watch, you'd fantasize that.</p><p> You know, the Washington Post bringing down Donald Trump.  It's not really  like Nixon's first year at all, its much more like Bill Clinton first year.   Go back and read woodward the agenda, change the names and you can have the  version of what we've seen in the last year.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  We're going to talk more about (INAUDIBLE) Niall Ferguson,  Author of \"The Square and the Tower is staying with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  We're back with Niall Ferguson.  He is author of the new book  \"The Square and the Tower\", Networks Empower from the Freemasons to  Facebook.  So we were just talking before about the sort of fundamental  basis of this book and what it means and actually where Donald Trump sits  in between the interplay between hierarchies in history and social network.</p><p> And how they've evolved overtime, he is someone who harness in a unique way  like thinking political terms at least at that point in time, the power of  social network and what that mean for democracy.</p><p> .FERGUSON:  Well, in someway in the Brexit referendum was like the over the  chart of the main show in 2016 because the leave campaign used Facebook as  an advertising tool and just the way of the Trump campaign did.</p><p> But this book is about showing how social networks have always been there.   It's not like Marks (ph) of Caberg (ph) invented them.  All that Facebook  did was to make them bigger and faster than they ever were before.  But  throughout history there have been periods when a new networks have come  along and disrupted established hierarchies, those big tower of power that  usually rule.</p><p> And my favorite example is from 500 years ago when the printing press  completely disrupted European politics, causes the reformation Martin  Luther without the printing press would just been birth at the state like  hierarchy (ph).  And we've never averted him.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  When you got the day off on Monday.</p><p> FERGUSON:  It's true.  So that certain that's another Martin Luther, that  Martin the King introvertly and so had a social network, in the civil  rights wouldn't have work if they haven't been this network of churches in  the South that had the people organized and should cancel their commitment  when it came to often very hazardous demonstration.</p><p> Social networks all that you don't need the internet to have them.  All  we've done is making them bigger and faster and I think more powerful than  they've been certainly anytime in the last 400 or 300 years.</p><p> FU:  And easier to corrupt as well, because of the platform.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Right, this is the problem that makes it different from the age  of printing press.  There wasn't one person who owned over printing press  is in 16th or 17th century Europe whereas social networks today are very  concentrated and their ownership.</p><p> And this point of view, it's kind of extraordinary, these quasi-monopolies  that have emerged online and seach, you've got Google retail, you've got  Amazon, and of course in social media we've got Facebook.</p><p> This is extraordinary power.  Facebook is the biggest content publisher in  all of history.  Zuckerberg is more powerful than William Randolph Hearst  or Rupert Murdoch, any previous proprietor of the media organization.</p><p> And yet, Facebook is regulated as if it's a tech platform, not a content  publisher.  And that seem to me an extraordinary anomaly considering that  45 percent of Americans are getting their news from Facebook.</p><p> FU:  Facebook is also reluctant to take on mental (ph) of assuming  responsibility, should they?</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Also now.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, they're indeed.  And it's one of the key arguments that I  think will play out in the coming years.  Is it a content publisher?  If it  is, should it be liable for all the content that appears and the content,  his vast in his content (ph).</p><p> I mean every now and then they'll say that they're hiring 10,000 people to  bet the content.  I mean come on the sheer scale of the content that is if  you're Facebook he's going to require many, many more than 10,000 fact  checkers.</p><p> I think this us a big issue.  A lot of discussion on the big tech companies  recently has been about anti-trust.  I think that is a complete red  herring.  These are natural monopolies, you couldn't break them up.  It's  not going to happen.  And the law, I don't think would support antitrust  actions against these companies.</p><p> But I think the exemptions from liability for content that we're  establishing mid 1990's when Facebook didn't even exist, those look like a  vulnerability and I would just surprise if legislators and regulators begun  to ask questions about that in the coming months</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  What about for somebody like Amazon and the power that they  continue to accrue or Google for that matter?  Like who disrupts the  ultimate disruptive that they've been in such a small space of time.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, if I were Jeff Bezos, I wish I were.  But I would be  worried much more about my rivals in Asia.  I'd be looking at Alibaba, I'd  be looking at Jack Ma and I'd be thinking, you know, I thought I was going  to own the rest of world and you would just of China.</p><p> I begin to wonder and I just was Hang Joe (ph) looking at what's going on.   Alibaba could it be that the big Chinese tech companies are about to make a  push for market share outside of China, and we might find the U.S.  companies beginning to lose that.  That would be my worry at Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is going to stay  with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Let's talk a bit more now about Bitcoin.  We're back with  Niall Ferguson.  He says Bitcoin mega pot but the revolution will go on.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, I said that when it was around about I think 1900 and it  did go drop (ph).  I have to tell about the story --</p><p> FU:  You should be trading.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, I don't know.  The first thing should be trading is my  son.  So when he's 15th, it's now 18th now some back he said to me \"Dad,  you really should buy Bitcoin.\"  And pompously I Professor Ferguson says  \"Young man, what do you know about financial history, this can never work.   And I would call Jamie Dimon I almost said tulips (ph).</p><p> Well, I kind of learn the hard way.  He was right.  And I can got -- that  caught up last year and began to really think about this.  And we're amidst  of an Amazing financial revolution which isn't just about Bitcoin.  It's  about Blockchain generally and what Blockchain can do.</p><p> I think a lot of people have got, you got confused by the term  cryptocurrency.  And because I'm not sure that we're going to produce a new  form of money this way.  But we have produced, what Bitcoin has produced  is, number one, a new kind of store of value and may be more importantly a  speculative object with more volatility than any other financial market.   And, you know, for some people that's attractive including my son.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Three years ago, he was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> FERGUSON:  Like $350 (ph) was the price.  If I had listen to him I wouldn't  have to run around New York City doing institute like, you know, I've been  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Does he still own it?</p><p> FERGUSON:  I wish, he would say not nearly enough because don't think he  landscape (ph) in the room to make a message something like three.</p><p> FU:  Wow (INAUDIBLE).  But on paper he's doing pretty well right now.  He  reminds me of this on a regular basis.  I mean the correction interesting.   I had one thing that I came to see last year was that there would a  correction because it has a classic bubble quality to it.</p><p> All those ICOs that initial coin offering were plastic bubbles.  On  territory a lot of it almost certainly fraudulent but I must say, I decided  that 10,000 was the entry point.  So when it went below 10, this week, I'm  afraid I became a buyer.</p><p> FU:  Wow, for disclosure.  Niall Ferguson, Bitcoin owner.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Yes, only my son's advice.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Wow.  Now we have to see Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square  and the Tower\" is staying with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU:  Now still with us, is Niall Ferguson, he's new book \"The Square and  the Tower\" looks at tensions in Silicon Valley between hierarchies and  networks.  And of course, not just in Silicon Valley but in countries and  societies around the world.</p><p> Niall, let's talk a little bit about Uber here because is this a network in  a same way that Facebook is a network or Twitter is a network?  Or is it  just a very narrow business in which Travis  Kalanick has been able to ride  the Silicon Valley wave?</p><p> FERGUSON:  It was definitely a network business and ride sharing (ph) was a  classic example of what you could do with what people called society  market, the goal was to establish just the kind of dominance that had been  established by Facebook and social network, Google and search et cetera.</p><p> And I think what's important here.  I've read the story that you just  talked about.  It's not just the missteps Travis Kalanick made personally.   It's also the fact that, I think he personified a certain Silicon Valley  arrogance that I use to characterize as resistance is futile.</p><p> The attitude was, we have this awesome app, there's no point standing in  our way.  We will take the world one city at the time.  And I can remember  talking.  We've seen another about this saying, you know, what is going to  be different in Berlin.  It's going to be different in China.</p><p> And indeed I write in the book about why it was the ultimately Uber lost  the battle in China to Didi, which is an amazing story.  And a typical  story of what is going on in the world today, because these race if you  like for dominance of these two sided markets is a race that's been run not  just by U.S. companies but also by Chinese companies.</p><p> By the way, not by European companies, very interesting that Europe hasn't  produced really any technology giants.  And I think this races to  relatively early stage.  It's not clear who will really be dominant for  example in global online retail 10 years from now.  And my hunch is it  won't necessarily be Amazon.</p><p> If you go talk to the people at Alibaba, they'll say we have a better  understanding of emerging markets and we're going to own not just china,  we're going to own  Eurasia, and  then move on to Africa and Latin America  and leave you guys the United States, that would be a really remarkable  turn of events that it happened.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Do point that Travis though seems to be making, would be  seemingly making to you that there was a regulator that so far behind.</p><p> The technology innovation go so fast, that actually they've got a potential  hit and move into all these different markets.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Right.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  And not necessarily worry so much.  At one point in the story  he was on his knees calling saying, I'm so terrible.  He then jump up to go  back into that meeting and was that, we have a P.R. problem.  That there's  no cultural problem there, we have a P.R. problem.  At what point is that  relevant for such a huge network and so many networks around the world that  we have.</p><p> FERGUSON:  I think that's a very Silicon Valley response to a problem.  And  it's not yet that different from the way Facebook initially responded when  people started to say, hey, you know, you played something of a  destabilizing role in the 2016 election.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg initial reaction was, the idea that fake news on Facebook  had anything to do with this result is crazy.  Well, of course, the tone  quickly changed but at first the response is always, we have a P.R.  problem, go fix the P.R., rather than recognizing.  But sometimes the  problems are very fundamental.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  So respond or break?</p><p> FERGUSON:  I think there has to be a bigger response than we've seen so  far.  These companies have become enormously powerful with huge markets  shares.  I don't think there's ever going to be a successful breakup.  I  think antitrust won't work.</p><p> But I do think we need to think about the implications, particularly in the  realm of our public sphere, of having a very small number of companies  dominating online advertising, you know, Mike Bloomberg himself said just  last year there has to be some liability for the content that these network  platform produce.</p><p> I agree with that wholeheartedly.  It's an anomaly that the biggest content  publishers are being regulated as they just tech companies.  And I think  you're right.  The regulators are behind as they are with Bitcoin, as  they're with cryptocurrency.</p><p> But history tells us that no matter how rapidly a network grows, the  regulators, the government eventually catches up.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But the network itself has a backlash go with Didi Uber  (INAUDIBLE).  Where network itself then that was responds and try to  politic change.</p><p> FERGUSON:  And there is something about backlash for Facebook too, just  beginning to make itself felt.</p><p> FU:  Right.  Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you  for that.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Still with us Niall Ferguson and just being that's going to be  an interesting vote in Pennsylvania for Trump here.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Absolutely, Pennsylvania a key state for him in 2016.  It's a  place where he'll be looking to mobilize those voters as he turn back in  November.</p><p> FU:  Why do you think his popularity is still so high?  There's so much  resilience there, even as we talk earlier about his missteps, for instance  sounding off on Twitter, making these comments that don't help him, where  he shoots himself in the foot.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, somewhere around about a third, maybe for 35 percent and  may be 40 percent of voters are very solidly pro Trump.  And I don't think  it's just his larger than life personality.  There was content to Trump's  campaign.  Sometimes this is forgotten in all the discussion.</p><p> FU:  But the content changes a lot.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Yes, but the message when he ran was I'm going to do something  about immigration, I'm going to do something about trade, free trade.  I'm  also going to tackle the perception that Washington is corrupt and it's a  swamp.</p><p> And I think those votes were attracted by that message are prepared to cut  Donald Trump an awful lot of slack as long as they  feel that he is still  roughly pointing in that direction and as long as they feel that he  connects with them.</p><p> And I do think his ability to connect with people in Middle America,  considering the man is a wealthy New York real estate developer by origin  is amazing.  But it's real.  And I think that's the key, his ability to  talk to them in the sometimes off-color language that they relate to.</p><p> So those people are not going to defect, and from the Republican  establishment's point of view, they can't deserve Donald Trump.  You can't  give away a third of the electorate.</p><p> FU:  Yes.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.  The question is, can he do anything wrong in their eyes.   We're going to come back to this conversation.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  We're back with Niall Ferguson.  The author of \"The Square and  the Tower\".  Trump in Davos, how's that going to g?</p><p> FERGUSON:  It won't go that bad.  I mean, they're going to talk to him with  rough legs, are they?  It's Davos, he's the president that Klaus Schwab  will be polite.  They'll be plenty of applause.  I guess he'll give a  speech somewhat like his Warsaw speech.  And I'll be OK.</p><p> I mean, Davos hate Trump and what he stands for.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  He's antithesis (ph) of the Davos.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Yes.  I mean he basically hates some globalization and that's  what they're about.  On the other hand he's powerful.  He's the President  of the United States and Davos also like power.  So I thin -- he'll get  kind of polite somewhat frosty reception.</p><p> But I think the interesting thing about Davos is that it is the network of  network.  I mean that's where people go who live to network.  And it's the  very high end network.  The question will be, what will go on behind the  scene, I don't really care about the speeches and sessions.  What's  important at Davos is the meetings.</p><p> FU:  Who's at piano bar at midnight?</p><p> FERGUSON:  Correct.  And I know suppose Trump will there.  At lease his  handlers where he want him to be at the piano bar at midnight.  But may be  interesting meetings going on back stage in those meetings rooms and some  of the big hotels.</p><p> The interesting to see that any of the leaders, the European leaders for  example Macron will be there.  The French President Emmanuel Macron, the  German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  They going to meet with Trump.  If  anything going to get done, that's for me the interesting point.</p><p> FU:  What's the most important meeting for him do you think?</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, I think that if you think back to the way Macron played  him with that eternal handshake, the longest handshake in diplomatic  history.</p><p> FU:  We've already seen that.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, the question really is can Macron help Trump in Europe.   Trump is deeply unpopular in Europe even more unpopular than in Manhattan  harder that is to believe.  And yet, Trump is actually being winning on the  key issue, which is being European contribution to NATO.  He's kind of won  that argument, they had to fold because he was right.</p><p> I sense there's a possibility that relationship with France can yield  something for the United States and compensate for Trump's deep on  popularity amongst European population.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  There some little bit of bromance there.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Definitely.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Niall Ferguson author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you  so much.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and  a Senior Fellow at the Center for European state at Harvard.  He is also  the Author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower.  Networks empower  from the Freemasons to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Niall, thanks so much for joining us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE:  Great to be here.</p><p>FU:  So we were just talking with Mike about President Trump and the  looming government shutdown, if that happens.  I want to start first with  the presidency with you because in the past, you have called his presidency  a comedy rather than a tragedy.</p><p>We've seen the administration scramble to perhaps a government shutdown,  while at the same time saying may be a shutdown will be good.  No matter  what happens though, the base and his support is still there.  Is it a wise  move for the President right now to be pinning everything on the base  staying with him as he touts the economy doing well and the stock market  doing well, that can all go up in flames very quickly?</p><p>FERGUSON:  It could.  We all know that financial markets have a way of  surprising that the bull market is forever.  And there have been many  people, my colleague at Harvard Martin Feldstein just this weekend in the  general who've warned that a correction could come along and spoil that  post of Donald Trumps argument.</p><p>But on the other hand if you look at that approval rating of his, it has  not been taking off in the last few --</p><p>FU:  From a little bit.</p><p>FERGUSON:  From a historic a little bit.  Remember he was the most  unpopular President at the outset, since polling began.  And he didn't get  any more popular in his first year.  But you begin to see the possible  inflection point here as the economic good news just keeps on coming in.   Plus it's a point that Trump is getting some wins on foreign policy, there  aren't really anything like enough airtime.</p><p>I mean, he can change the policy in Iran and by the end of last year.  Iran  was in a state of upheaval.  He took a much tougher line on North Korea.   And now guess what, the North Korean's and South Korean's are making nice  with one another.</p><p>So, one of the things that ordered by the Trump Presidencies is the way  that he tend to shoot himself with that Twitter feed of his.  And if he  tweeted less and said fewer off the cuff races things that shocked so many  peoples unjustly, we would be focusing more on the outcomes.  We'd be  focusing more on what's actually getting done.</p><p>And I think  that would in fact reflect much better on him.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Do you think he's undermining he's own  success?</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, I think the strategy is come up in raging liberal by being  outrageous has one benefit.  That is that seems to force Democrats to the  left.  And I think on sees (ph) this on the immigration issue.  It's quite  good from a Republicans strategic point of few, if the Democrats become  more and more committed to sanctuary cities to the undocumented.</p><p>A lot of Republicans don't feel good about that at all.  But my sense is  that the cost and benefits of the President's populist outrage are kind of  finally poised at this point.  And I'm not sure he's necessary net better  off with some of the most outrageous things that he said of late.</p><p>I think if he'd said much less over the last let say 12 months.  And focus  more on the achievements, he'd be riding higher in the polls.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Do you think we've seen the loads as far as the politics  concerns because as many aspects now already short-term and longer-term are  playing to his favor, if we keep the tweeting aside?</p><p>FERGUSON:  Right.  I mean, one of the things I've tried to argue in The  Square and the Tower is that we have a new kind of politics.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Right.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Which some of the still struggling to get ahead around is the  public spear that's no longer dominated by network television, that's  increasingly dominated by social media and the President has shown himself  to have much better understanding not just the Twitter but the  Facebook  than his political rivals.</p><p>So one thing I did learn over two years of thinking and writing about  Donald Trump is don't underestimate him and don't make the mistake of  judging him by conventional measure.  One thing I did recently was to just  to run an experiment.  I ask myself leaving aside personalities.</p><p>What presidency is this dislike?  I mean this like the first year of Nixon  and a lots of people have drawn that parallel, there's a lot of Democrats  who would love this to be Watergate all over again is even the movie by  Spielberg and go watch, you'd fantasize that.</p><p>You know, the Washington Post bringing down Donald Trump.  It's not really  like Nixon's first year at all, its much more like Bill Clinton first year.   Go back and read woodward the agenda, change the names and you can have the  version of what we've seen in the last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  We're going to talk more about (INAUDIBLE) Niall Ferguson,  Author of \"The Square and the Tower is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  We're back with Niall Ferguson.  He is author of the new book  \"The Square and the Tower\", Networks Empower from the Freemasons to  Facebook.  So we were just talking before about the sort of fundamental  basis of this book and what it means and actually where Donald Trump sits  in between the interplay between hierarchies in history and social network.</p><p>And how they've evolved overtime, he is someone who harness in a unique way  like thinking political terms at least at that point in time, the power of  social network and what that mean for democracy.</p><p>.FERGUSON:  Well, in someway in the Brexit referendum was like the over the  chart of the main show in 2016 because the leave campaign used Facebook as  an advertising tool and just the way of the Trump campaign did.</p><p>But this book is about showing how social networks have always been there.   It's not like Marks (ph) of Caberg (ph) invented them.  All that Facebook  did was to make them bigger and faster than they ever were before.  But  throughout history there have been periods when a new networks have come  along and disrupted established hierarchies, those big tower of power that  usually rule.</p><p>And my favorite example is from 500 years ago when the printing press  completely disrupted European politics, causes the reformation Martin  Luther without the printing press would just been birth at the state like  hierarchy (ph).  And we've never averted him.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  When you got the day off on Monday.</p><p>FERGUSON:  It's true.  So that certain that's another Martin Luther, that  Martin the King introvertly and so had a social network, in the civil  rights wouldn't have work if they haven't been this network of churches in  the South that had the people organized and should cancel their commitment  when it came to often very hazardous demonstration.</p><p>Social networks all that you don't need the internet to have them.  All  we've done is making them bigger and faster and I think more powerful than  they've been certainly anytime in the last 400 or 300 years.</p><p>FU:  And easier to corrupt as well, because of the platform.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Right, this is the problem that makes it different from the age  of printing press.  There wasn't one person who owned over printing press  is in 16th or 17th century Europe whereas social networks today are very  concentrated and their ownership.</p><p>And this point of view, it's kind of extraordinary, these quasi-monopolies  that have emerged online and seach, you've got Google retail, you've got  Amazon, and of course in social media we've got Facebook.</p><p>This is extraordinary power.  Facebook is the biggest content publisher in  all of history.  Zuckerberg is more powerful than William Randolph Hearst  or Rupert Murdoch, any previous proprietor of the media organization.</p><p>And yet, Facebook is regulated as if it's a tech platform, not a content  publisher.  And that seem to me an extraordinary anomaly considering that  45 percent of Americans are getting their news from Facebook.</p><p>FU:  Facebook is also reluctant to take on mental (ph) of assuming  responsibility, should they?</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Also now.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, they're indeed.  And it's one of the key arguments that I  think will play out in the coming years.  Is it a content publisher?  If it  is, should it be liable for all the content that appears and the content,  his vast in his content (ph).</p><p>I mean every now and then they'll say that they're hiring 10,000 people to  bet the content.  I mean come on the sheer scale of the content that is if  you're Facebook he's going to require many, many more than 10,000 fact  checkers.</p><p>I think this us a big issue.  A lot of discussion on the big tech companies  recently has been about anti-trust.  I think that is a complete red  herring.  These are natural monopolies, you couldn't break them up.  It's  not going to happen.  And the law, I don't think would support antitrust  actions against these companies.</p><p>But I think the exemptions from liability for content that we're  establishing mid 1990's when Facebook didn't even exist, those look like a  vulnerability and I would just surprise if legislators and regulators begun  to ask questions about that in the coming months</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  What about for somebody like Amazon and the power that they  continue to accrue or Google for that matter?  Like who disrupts the  ultimate disruptive that they've been in such a small space of time.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, if I were Jeff Bezos, I wish I were.  But I would be  worried much more about my rivals in Asia.  I'd be looking at Alibaba, I'd  be looking at Jack Ma and I'd be thinking, you know, I thought I was going  to own the rest of world and you would just of China.</p><p>I begin to wonder and I just was Hang Joe (ph) looking at what's going on.   Alibaba could it be that the big Chinese tech companies are about to make a  push for market share outside of China, and we might find the U.S.  companies beginning to lose that.  That would be my worry at Amazon.</p><p>FU:  Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is going to stay  with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Let's talk a bit more now about Bitcoin.  We're back with  Niall Ferguson.  He says Bitcoin mega pot but the revolution will go on.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, I said that when it was around about I think 1900 and it  did go drop (ph).  I have to tell about the story --</p><p>FU:  You should be trading.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, I don't know.  The first thing should be trading is my  son.  So when he's 15th, it's now 18th now some back he said to me \"Dad,  you really should buy Bitcoin.\"  And pompously I Professor Ferguson says  \"Young man, what do you know about financial history, this can never work.   And I would call Jamie Dimon I almost said tulips (ph).</p><p>Well, I kind of learn the hard way.  He was right.  And I can got -- that  caught up last year and began to really think about this.  And we're amidst  of an Amazing financial revolution which isn't just about Bitcoin.  It's  about Blockchain generally and what Blockchain can do.</p><p>I think a lot of people have got, you got confused by the term  cryptocurrency.  And because I'm not sure that we're going to produce a new  form of money this way.  But we have produced, what Bitcoin has produced  is, number one, a new kind of store of value and may be more importantly a  speculative object with more volatility than any other financial market.   And, you know, for some people that's attractive including my son.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Three years ago, he was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FERGUSON:  Like $350 (ph) was the price.  If I had listen to him I wouldn't  have to run around New York City doing institute like, you know, I've been  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Does he still own it?</p><p>FERGUSON:  I wish, he would say not nearly enough because don't think he  landscape (ph) in the room to make a message something like three.</p><p>FU:  Wow (INAUDIBLE).  But on paper he's doing pretty well right now.  He  reminds me of this on a regular basis.  I mean the correction interesting.   I had one thing that I came to see last year was that there would a  correction because it has a classic bubble quality to it.</p><p>All those ICOs that initial coin offering were plastic bubbles.  On  territory a lot of it almost certainly fraudulent but I must say, I decided  that 10,000 was the entry point.  So when it went below 10, this week, I'm  afraid I became a buyer.</p><p>FU:  Wow, for disclosure.  Niall Ferguson, Bitcoin owner.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Yes, only my son's advice.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Wow.  Now we have to see Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square  and the Tower\" is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU:  Now still with us, is Niall Ferguson, he's new book \"The Square and  the Tower\" looks at tensions in Silicon Valley between hierarchies and  networks.  And of course, not just in Silicon Valley but in countries and  societies around the world.</p><p>Niall, let's talk a little bit about Uber here because is this a network in  a same way that Facebook is a network or Twitter is a network?  Or is it  just a very narrow business in which Travis  Kalanick has been able to ride  the Silicon Valley wave?</p><p>FERGUSON:  It was definitely a network business and ride sharing (ph) was a  classic example of what you could do with what people called society  market, the goal was to establish just the kind of dominance that had been  established by Facebook and social network, Google and search et cetera.</p><p>And I think what's important here.  I've read the story that you just  talked about.  It's not just the missteps Travis Kalanick made personally.   It's also the fact that, I think he personified a certain Silicon Valley  arrogance that I use to characterize as resistance is futile.</p><p>The attitude was, we have this awesome app, there's no point standing in  our way.  We will take the world one city at the time.  And I can remember  talking.  We've seen another about this saying, you know, what is going to  be different in Berlin.  It's going to be different in China.</p><p>And indeed I write in the book about why it was the ultimately Uber lost  the battle in China to Didi, which is an amazing story.  And a typical  story of what is going on in the world today, because these race if you  like for dominance of these two sided markets is a race that's been run not  just by U.S. companies but also by Chinese companies.</p><p>By the way, not by European companies, very interesting that Europe hasn't  produced really any technology giants.  And I think this races to  relatively early stage.  It's not clear who will really be dominant for  example in global online retail 10 years from now.  And my hunch is it  won't necessarily be Amazon.</p><p>If you go talk to the people at Alibaba, they'll say we have a better  understanding of emerging markets and we're going to own not just china,  we're going to own  Eurasia, and  then move on to Africa and Latin America  and leave you guys the United States, that would be a really remarkable  turn of events that it happened.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Do point that Travis though seems to be making, would be  seemingly making to you that there was a regulator that so far behind.</p><p>The technology innovation go so fast, that actually they've got a potential  hit and move into all these different markets.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  And not necessarily worry so much.  At one point in the story  he was on his knees calling saying, I'm so terrible.  He then jump up to go  back into that meeting and was that, we have a P.R. problem.  That there's  no cultural problem there, we have a P.R. problem.  At what point is that  relevant for such a huge network and so many networks around the world that  we have.</p><p>FERGUSON:  I think that's a very Silicon Valley response to a problem.  And  it's not yet that different from the way Facebook initially responded when  people started to say, hey, you know, you played something of a  destabilizing role in the 2016 election.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg initial reaction was, the idea that fake news on Facebook  had anything to do with this result is crazy.  Well, of course, the tone  quickly changed but at first the response is always, we have a P.R.  problem, go fix the P.R., rather than recognizing.  But sometimes the  problems are very fundamental.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  So respond or break?</p><p>FERGUSON:  I think there has to be a bigger response than we've seen so  far.  These companies have become enormously powerful with huge markets  shares.  I don't think there's ever going to be a successful breakup.  I  think antitrust won't work.</p><p>But I do think we need to think about the implications, particularly in the  realm of our public sphere, of having a very small number of companies  dominating online advertising, you know, Mike Bloomberg himself said just  last year there has to be some liability for the content that these network  platform produce.</p><p>I agree with that wholeheartedly.  It's an anomaly that the biggest content  publishers are being regulated as they just tech companies.  And I think  you're right.  The regulators are behind as they are with Bitcoin, as  they're with cryptocurrency.</p><p>But history tells us that no matter how rapidly a network grows, the  regulators, the government eventually catches up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  But the network itself has a backlash go with Didi Uber  (INAUDIBLE).  Where network itself then that was responds and try to  politic change.</p><p>FERGUSON:  And there is something about backlash for Facebook too, just  beginning to make itself felt.</p><p>FU:  Right.  Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you  for that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Still with us Niall Ferguson and just being that's going to be  an interesting vote in Pennsylvania for Trump here.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Absolutely, Pennsylvania a key state for him in 2016.  It's a  place where he'll be looking to mobilize those voters as he turn back in  November.</p><p>FU:  Why do you think his popularity is still so high?  There's so much  resilience there, even as we talk earlier about his missteps, for instance  sounding off on Twitter, making these comments that don't help him, where  he shoots himself in the foot.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, somewhere around about a third, maybe for 35 percent and  may be 40 percent of voters are very solidly pro Trump.  And I don't think  it's just his larger than life personality.  There was content to Trump's  campaign.  Sometimes this is forgotten in all the discussion.</p><p>FU:  But the content changes a lot.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Yes, but the message when he ran was I'm going to do something  about immigration, I'm going to do something about trade, free trade.  I'm  also going to tackle the perception that Washington is corrupt and it's a  swamp.</p><p>And I think those votes were attracted by that message are prepared to cut  Donald Trump an awful lot of slack as long as they  feel that he is still  roughly pointing in that direction and as long as they feel that he  connects with them.</p><p>And I do think his ability to connect with people in Middle America,  considering the man is a wealthy New York real estate developer by origin  is amazing.  But it's real.  And I think that's the key, his ability to  talk to them in the sometimes off-color language that they relate to.</p><p>So those people are not going to defect, and from the Republican  establishment's point of view, they can't deserve Donald Trump.  You can't  give away a third of the electorate.</p><p>FU:  Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.  The question is, can he do anything wrong in their eyes.   We're going to come back to this conversation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  We're back with Niall Ferguson.  The author of \"The Square and  the Tower\".  Trump in Davos, how's that going to g?</p><p>FERGUSON:  It won't go that bad.  I mean, they're going to talk to him with  rough legs, are they?  It's Davos, he's the president that Klaus Schwab  will be polite.  They'll be plenty of applause.  I guess he'll give a  speech somewhat like his Warsaw speech.  And I'll be OK.</p><p>I mean, Davos hate Trump and what he stands for.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  He's antithesis (ph) of the Davos.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Yes.  I mean he basically hates some globalization and that's  what they're about.  On the other hand he's powerful.  He's the President  of the United States and Davos also like power.  So I thin -- he'll get  kind of polite somewhat frosty reception.</p><p>But I think the interesting thing about Davos is that it is the network of  network.  I mean that's where people go who live to network.  And it's the  very high end network.  The question will be, what will go on behind the  scene, I don't really care about the speeches and sessions.  What's  important at Davos is the meetings.</p><p>FU:  Who's at piano bar at midnight?</p><p>FERGUSON:  Correct.  And I know suppose Trump will there.  At lease his  handlers where he want him to be at the piano bar at midnight.  But may be  interesting meetings going on back stage in those meetings rooms and some  of the big hotels.</p><p>The interesting to see that any of the leaders, the European leaders for  example Macron will be there.  The French President Emmanuel Macron, the  German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  They going to meet with Trump.  If  anything going to get done, that's for me the interesting point.</p><p>FU:  What's the most important meeting for him do you think?</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, I think that if you think back to the way Macron played  him with that eternal handshake, the longest handshake in diplomatic  history.</p><p>FU:  We've already seen that.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, the question really is can Macron help Trump in Europe.   Trump is deeply unpopular in Europe even more unpopular than in Manhattan  harder that is to believe.  And yet, Trump is actually being winning on the  key issue, which is being European contribution to NATO.  He's kind of won  that argument, they had to fold because he was right.</p><p>I sense there's a possibility that relationship with France can yield  something for the United States and compensate for Trump's deep on  popularity amongst European population.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  There some little bit of bromance there.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Definitely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Niall Ferguson author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you  so much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior Fellow at the Center for European state at Harvard. He is also the Author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower. Networks empower from the Freemasons to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Niall, thanks so much for joining us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Great to be here.</p><p>FU: So we were just talking with Mike about President Trump and the looming government shutdown, if that happens. I want to start first with the presidency with you because in the past, you have called his presidency a comedy rather than a tragedy.</p><p>We've seen the administration scramble to perhaps a government shutdown, while at the same time saying may be a shutdown will be good. No matter what happens though, the base and his support is still there. Is it a wise move for the President right now to be pinning everything on the base staying with him as he touts the economy doing well and the stock market doing well, that can all go up in flames very quickly?</p><p>FERGUSON: It could. We all know that financial markets have a way of surprising that the bull market is forever. And there have been many people, my colleague at Harvard Martin Feldstein just this weekend in the general who've warned that a correction could come along and spoil that post of Donald Trumps argument.</p><p>But on the other hand if you look at that approval rating of his, it has not been taking off in the last few --</p><p>FU: From a little bit.</p><p>FERGUSON: From a historic a little bit. Remember he was the most unpopular President at the outset, since polling began. And he didn't get any more popular in his first year. But you begin to see the possible inflection point here as the economic good news just keeps on coming in. Plus it's a point that Trump is getting some wins on foreign policy, there aren't really anything like enough airtime.</p><p>I mean, he can change the policy in Iran and by the end of last year. Iran was in a state of upheaval. He took a much tougher line on North Korea. And now guess what, the North Korean's and South Korean's are making nice with one another.</p><p>So, one of the things that ordered by the Trump Presidencies is the way that he tend to shoot himself with that Twitter feed of his. And if he tweeted less and said fewer off the cuff races things that shocked so many peoples unjustly, we would be focusing more on the outcomes. We'd be focusing more on what's actually getting done.</p><p>And I think that would in fact reflect much better on him.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Do you think he's undermining he's own success?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I think the strategy is come up in raging liberal by being outrageous has one benefit. That is that seems to force Democrats to the left. And I think on sees (ph) this on the immigration issue. It's quite good from a Republicans strategic point of few, if the Democrats become more and more committed to sanctuary cities to the undocumented.</p><p>A lot of Republicans don't feel good about that at all. But my sense is that the cost and benefits of the President's populist outrage are kind of finally poised at this point. And I'm not sure he's necessary net better off with some of the most outrageous things that he said of late.</p><p>I think if he'd said much less over the last let say 12 months. And focus more on the achievements, he'd be riding higher in the polls.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think we've seen the loads as far as the politics concerns because as many aspects now already short-term and longer-term are playing to his favor, if we keep the tweeting aside?</p><p>FERGUSON: Right. I mean, one of the things I've tried to argue in The Square and the Tower is that we have a new kind of politics.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>FERGUSON: Which some of the still struggling to get ahead around is the public spear that's no longer dominated by network television, that's increasingly dominated by social media and the President has shown himself to have much better understanding not just the Twitter but the Facebook than his political rivals.</p><p>So one thing I did learn over two years of thinking and writing about Donald Trump is don't underestimate him and don't make the mistake of judging him by conventional measure. One thing I did recently was to just to run an experiment. I ask myself leaving aside personalities.</p><p>What presidency is this dislike? I mean this like the first year of Nixon and a lots of people have drawn that parallel, there's a lot of Democrats who would love this to be Watergate all over again is even the movie by Spielberg and go watch, you'd fantasize that.</p><p>You know, the Washington Post bringing down Donald Trump. It's not really like Nixon's first year at all, its much more like Bill Clinton first year. Go back and read woodward the agenda, change the names and you can have the version of what we've seen in the last year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're going to talk more about (INAUDIBLE) Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're back with Niall Ferguson. He is author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower\", Networks Empower from the Freemasons to Facebook. So we were just talking before about the sort of fundamental basis of this book and what it means and actually where Donald Trump sits in between the interplay between hierarchies in history and social network.</p><p>And how they've evolved overtime, he is someone who harness in a unique way like thinking political terms at least at that point in time, the power of social network and what that mean for democracy.</p><p>.FERGUSON: Well, in someway in the Brexit referendum was like the over the chart of the main show in 2016 because the leave campaign used Facebook as an advertising tool and just the way of the Trump campaign did.</p><p>But this book is about showing how social networks have always been there. It's not like Marks (ph) of Caberg (ph) invented them. All that Facebook did was to make them bigger and faster than they ever were before. But throughout history there have been periods when a new networks have come along and disrupted established hierarchies, those big tower of power that usually rule.</p><p>And my favorite example is from 500 years ago when the printing press completely disrupted European politics, causes the reformation Martin Luther without the printing press would just been birth at the state like hierarchy (ph). And we've never averted him.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When you got the day off on Monday.</p><p>FERGUSON: It's true. So that certain that's another Martin Luther, that Martin the King introvertly and so had a social network, in the civil rights wouldn't have work if they haven't been this network of churches in the South that had the people organized and should cancel their commitment when it came to often very hazardous demonstration.</p><p>Social networks all that you don't need the internet to have them. All we've done is making them bigger and faster and I think more powerful than they've been certainly anytime in the last 400 or 300 years.</p><p>FU: And easier to corrupt as well, because of the platform.</p><p>FERGUSON: Right, this is the problem that makes it different from the age of printing press. There wasn't one person who owned over printing press is in 16th or 17th century Europe whereas social networks today are very concentrated and their ownership.</p><p>And this point of view, it's kind of extraordinary, these quasi-monopolies that have emerged online and seach, you've got Google retail, you've got Amazon, and of course in social media we've got Facebook.</p><p>This is extraordinary power. Facebook is the biggest content publisher in all of history. Zuckerberg is more powerful than William Randolph Hearst or Rupert Murdoch, any previous proprietor of the media organization.</p><p>And yet, Facebook is regulated as if it's a tech platform, not a content publisher. And that seem to me an extraordinary anomaly considering that 45 percent of Americans are getting their news from Facebook.</p><p>FU: Facebook is also reluctant to take on mental (ph) of assuming responsibility, should they?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Also now.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, they're indeed. And it's one of the key arguments that I think will play out in the coming years. Is it a content publisher? If it is, should it be liable for all the content that appears and the content, his vast in his content (ph).</p><p>I mean every now and then they'll say that they're hiring 10,000 people to bet the content. I mean come on the sheer scale of the content that is if you're Facebook he's going to require many, many more than 10,000 fact checkers.</p><p>I think this us a big issue. A lot of discussion on the big tech companies recently has been about anti-trust. I think that is a complete red herring. These are natural monopolies, you couldn't break them up. It's not going to happen. And the law, I don't think would support antitrust actions against these companies.</p><p>But I think the exemptions from liability for content that we're establishing mid 1990's when Facebook didn't even exist, those look like a vulnerability and I would just surprise if legislators and regulators begun to ask questions about that in the coming months</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about for somebody like Amazon and the power that they continue to accrue or Google for that matter? Like who disrupts the ultimate disruptive that they've been in such a small space of time.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, if I were Jeff Bezos, I wish I were. But I would be worried much more about my rivals in Asia. I'd be looking at Alibaba, I'd be looking at Jack Ma and I'd be thinking, you know, I thought I was going to own the rest of world and you would just of China.</p><p>I begin to wonder and I just was Hang Joe (ph) looking at what's going on. Alibaba could it be that the big Chinese tech companies are about to make a push for market share outside of China, and we might find the U.S. companies beginning to lose that. That would be my worry at Amazon.</p><p>FU: Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is going to stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk a bit more now about Bitcoin. We're back with Niall Ferguson. He says Bitcoin mega pot but the revolution will go on.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I said that when it was around about I think 1900 and it did go drop (ph). I have to tell about the story --</p><p>FU: You should be trading.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I don't know. The first thing should be trading is my son. So when he's 15th, it's now 18th now some back he said to me \"Dad, you really should buy Bitcoin.\" And pompously I Professor Ferguson says \"Young man, what do you know about financial history, this can never work. And I would call Jamie Dimon I almost said tulips (ph).</p><p>Well, I kind of learn the hard way. He was right. And I can got -- that caught up last year and began to really think about this. And we're amidst of an Amazing financial revolution which isn't just about Bitcoin. It's about Blockchain generally and what Blockchain can do.</p><p>I think a lot of people have got, you got confused by the term cryptocurrency. And because I'm not sure that we're going to produce a new form of money this way. But we have produced, what Bitcoin has produced is, number one, a new kind of store of value and may be more importantly a speculative object with more volatility than any other financial market. And, you know, for some people that's attractive including my son.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Three years ago, he was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FERGUSON: Like $350 (ph) was the price. If I had listen to him I wouldn't have to run around New York City doing institute like, you know, I've been (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does he still own it?</p><p>FERGUSON: I wish, he would say not nearly enough because don't think he landscape (ph) in the room to make a message something like three.</p><p>FU: Wow (INAUDIBLE). But on paper he's doing pretty well right now. He reminds me of this on a regular basis. I mean the correction interesting. I had one thing that I came to see last year was that there would a correction because it has a classic bubble quality to it.</p><p>All those ICOs that initial coin offering were plastic bubbles. On territory a lot of it almost certainly fraudulent but I must say, I decided that 10,000 was the entry point. So when it went below 10, this week, I'm afraid I became a buyer.</p><p>FU: Wow, for disclosure. Niall Ferguson, Bitcoin owner.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, only my son's advice.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. Now we have to see Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is staying with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: Now still with us, is Niall Ferguson, he's new book \"The Square and the Tower\" looks at tensions in Silicon Valley between hierarchies and networks. And of course, not just in Silicon Valley but in countries and societies around the world.</p><p>Niall, let's talk a little bit about Uber here because is this a network in a same way that Facebook is a network or Twitter is a network? Or is it just a very narrow business in which Travis Kalanick has been able to ride the Silicon Valley wave?</p><p>FERGUSON: It was definitely a network business and ride sharing (ph) was a classic example of what you could do with what people called society market, the goal was to establish just the kind of dominance that had been established by Facebook and social network, Google and search et cetera.</p><p>And I think what's important here. I've read the story that you just talked about. It's not just the missteps Travis Kalanick made personally. It's also the fact that, I think he personified a certain Silicon Valley arrogance that I use to characterize as resistance is futile.</p><p>The attitude was, we have this awesome app, there's no point standing in our way. We will take the world one city at the time. And I can remember talking. We've seen another about this saying, you know, what is going to be different in Berlin. It's going to be different in China.</p><p>And indeed I write in the book about why it was the ultimately Uber lost the battle in China to Didi, which is an amazing story. And a typical story of what is going on in the world today, because these race if you like for dominance of these two sided markets is a race that's been run not just by U.S. companies but also by Chinese companies.</p><p>By the way, not by European companies, very interesting that Europe hasn't produced really any technology giants. And I think this races to relatively early stage. It's not clear who will really be dominant for example in global online retail 10 years from now. And my hunch is it won't necessarily be Amazon.</p><p>If you go talk to the people at Alibaba, they'll say we have a better understanding of emerging markets and we're going to own not just china, we're going to own Eurasia, and then move on to Africa and Latin America and leave you guys the United States, that would be a really remarkable turn of events that it happened.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do point that Travis though seems to be making, would be seemingly making to you that there was a regulator that so far behind.</p><p>The technology innovation go so fast, that actually they've got a potential hit and move into all these different markets.</p><p>FERGUSON: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And not necessarily worry so much. At one point in the story he was on his knees calling saying, I'm so terrible. He then jump up to go back into that meeting and was that, we have a P.R. problem. That there's no cultural problem there, we have a P.R. problem. At what point is that relevant for such a huge network and so many networks around the world that we have.</p><p>FERGUSON: I think that's a very Silicon Valley response to a problem. And it's not yet that different from the way Facebook initially responded when people started to say, hey, you know, you played something of a destabilizing role in the 2016 election.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg initial reaction was, the idea that fake news on Facebook had anything to do with this result is crazy. Well, of course, the tone quickly changed but at first the response is always, we have a P.R. problem, go fix the P.R., rather than recognizing. But sometimes the problems are very fundamental.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So respond or break?</p><p>FERGUSON: I think there has to be a bigger response than we've seen so far. These companies have become enormously powerful with huge markets shares. I don't think there's ever going to be a successful breakup. I think antitrust won't work.</p><p>But I do think we need to think about the implications, particularly in the realm of our public sphere, of having a very small number of companies dominating online advertising, you know, Mike Bloomberg himself said just last year there has to be some liability for the content that these network platform produce.</p><p>I agree with that wholeheartedly. It's an anomaly that the biggest content publishers are being regulated as they just tech companies. And I think you're right. The regulators are behind as they are with Bitcoin, as they're with cryptocurrency.</p><p>But history tells us that no matter how rapidly a network grows, the regulators, the government eventually catches up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But the network itself has a backlash go with Didi Uber (INAUDIBLE). Where network itself then that was responds and try to politic change.</p><p>FERGUSON: And there is something about backlash for Facebook too, just beginning to make itself felt.</p><p>FU: Right. Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you for that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Still with us Niall Ferguson and just being that's going to be an interesting vote in Pennsylvania for Trump here.</p><p>FERGUSON: Absolutely, Pennsylvania a key state for him in 2016. It's a place where he'll be looking to mobilize those voters as he turn back in November.</p><p>FU: Why do you think his popularity is still so high? There's so much resilience there, even as we talk earlier about his missteps, for instance sounding off on Twitter, making these comments that don't help him, where he shoots himself in the foot.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, somewhere around about a third, maybe for 35 percent and may be 40 percent of voters are very solidly pro Trump. And I don't think it's just his larger than life personality. There was content to Trump's campaign. Sometimes this is forgotten in all the discussion.</p><p>FU: But the content changes a lot.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, but the message when he ran was I'm going to do something about immigration, I'm going to do something about trade, free trade. I'm also going to tackle the perception that Washington is corrupt and it's a swamp.</p><p>And I think those votes were attracted by that message are prepared to cut Donald Trump an awful lot of slack as long as they feel that he is still roughly pointing in that direction and as long as they feel that he connects with them.</p><p>And I do think his ability to connect with people in Middle America, considering the man is a wealthy New York real estate developer by origin is amazing. But it's real. And I think that's the key, his ability to talk to them in the sometimes off-color language that they relate to.</p><p>So those people are not going to defect, and from the Republican establishment's point of view, they can't deserve Donald Trump. You can't give away a third of the electorate.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. The question is, can he do anything wrong in their eyes. We're going to come back to this conversation.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're back with Niall Ferguson. The author of \"The Square and the Tower\". Trump in Davos, how's that going to g?</p><p>FERGUSON: It won't go that bad. I mean, they're going to talk to him with rough legs, are they? It's Davos, he's the president that Klaus Schwab will be polite. They'll be plenty of applause. I guess he'll give a speech somewhat like his Warsaw speech. And I'll be OK.</p><p>I mean, Davos hate Trump and what he stands for.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He's antithesis (ph) of the Davos.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes. I mean he basically hates some globalization and that's what they're about. On the other hand he's powerful. He's the President of the United States and Davos also like power. So I thin -- he'll get kind of polite somewhat frosty reception.</p><p>But I think the interesting thing about Davos is that it is the network of network. I mean that's where people go who live to network. And it's the very high end network. The question will be, what will go on behind the scene, I don't really care about the speeches and sessions. What's important at Davos is the meetings.</p><p>FU: Who's at piano bar at midnight?</p><p>FERGUSON: Correct. And I know suppose Trump will there. At lease his handlers where he want him to be at the piano bar at midnight. But may be interesting meetings going on back stage in those meetings rooms and some of the big hotels.</p><p>The interesting to see that any of the leaders, the European leaders for example Macron will be there. The French President Emmanuel Macron, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They going to meet with Trump. If anything going to get done, that's for me the interesting point.</p><p>FU: What's the most important meeting for him do you think?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I think that if you think back to the way Macron played him with that eternal handshake, the longest handshake in diplomatic history.</p><p>FU: We've already seen that.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, the question really is can Macron help Trump in Europe. Trump is deeply unpopular in Europe even more unpopular than in Manhattan harder that is to believe. And yet, Trump is actually being winning on the key issue, which is being European contribution to NATO. He's kind of won that argument, they had to fold because he was right.</p><p>I sense there's a possibility that relationship with France can yield something for the United States and compensate for Trump's deep on popularity amongst European population.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There some little bit of bromance there.</p><p>FERGUSON: Definitely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Niall Ferguson author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you so much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Following is an interview with Ferguson on the subject.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What has changed on this topic since your book came out a year ago? Any surprises, new concerns, or flashpoints?</p><p>It surprised me that, a year ago, many peopleincluding legislators in Washington, DC, as well as journalists in many countries I visiteddid not fully understand the scale of the threat posed to civil discourse and the democratic process by the network platformsFacebook/Instagram, Google/YouTube, and Twitter, in particular. Now there is a much better understanding that something went quite seriously wrong in 2016; that the titans of Silicon Valley did their best to downplay the problems; and that not a great deal has really changed for the better since then. But we still have no consensus on what should be done, which was why I wrote a rather lengthy paper on that subject for George Shultz's seminar series on governance and technology.</p><p>Why are social networks and their use of emerging technologies threatening to power hierarchies in society?</p><p>Social networks are not something invented over the past two decades by Silicon Valley companies. They have always existed and are indeed one of the defining ways in which we as a species organize ourselves. All that has happened in our time is that technology innovations personal computers, smart phones, and the Internethave combined to make social networks bigger and faster than ever before. There is a close analogy with the way that the printing press expanded and accelerated social networks in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century Europe, except that our revolution in networking has happened an order of magnitude faster.</p><p>Now, as then, established hierarchical structuresthe papacy and Holy Roman Empire then; states, political parties, and established media companies in our timeface disruption. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but we should not delude ourselves that this disruption will be without its collateral damage. A good example is the way online social networks appear to be worsening political polarization in many democracies today.</p><p>How do power hierarchies flip technology to use it for their advantage in stifling democracy?</p><p>Just seven or eight years ago, it seemed clear to Eric Schmidt (the former executive chairman of Google) and his co-author Jared Cohen that the Internet was on the side of democracy and would help topple authoritarian rulers. That seemed to be true during the (misnamed) Arab Spring. We all underestimated the ability of undemocratic or semi-democratic regimes to adapt to the new technologies, and especially to find ways to exploit network platforms.</p><p>Exhibit A has been the way the Chinese Communist Party has made it hard for US companies to flourish in China, encouraging domestic tech companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are much readier to cooperate with the government's policies of social control. Exhibit B is the way the Russian government of Vladimir Putin not only has established state control over social as well as old media within its borders, but also has found ways to exploit the opportunities afforded by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to destabilize the election process in the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>How does a symbiosis between networks and hierarchies lead to stable rule?</p><p>I am not sure it's as simple as your question implies. As I show in the book, there isn't really a clear dichotomy between networks and hierarchies: there's a continuum from very hierarchical or centralized networks to very distributed or decentralized networks. Neither of the extremes is desirable: one gives too much control to a single \"node,\" the other runs the risk of anarchy.</p><p>Successful institutions therefore tend to be hybrids, combining some hierarchical structure with a measure of decentralization. In the international system, I point out the relative success of the \"pentarchy\" of five great powers that ran Europe and much of the rest of the world in the period 18151914. Yet that system was also sometimes called the concert of Europe. Lesser powers were not powerless; they were just not as powerful as the \"big five.\"</p><p>What is your prognosis for the future of US and Western democracy, given the current tension between hierarchies and networks in our societies?</p><p>I remain an optimist. Despite all the alarms and excursions around the 2016 election, and the forebodings of those who believe the republic is in danger and democracy in a global \"recession,\" in truth the outlook remains brighter for democracies (provided they maintain the rule of law and a vital civil society) than for autocracies, or even illiberal democracies. The United States has survived worse than this; American society has been more deeply divided, and much more prone to political violence, than it is today. As for our most committed antagonistsIran, North Korea, Russiathey are weak, and their repressive regimes are a reflection of that weakness. Even China may be running the risk of overconfidence these days.</p><p>A one-party state calls into being the biggest bourgeoisie in history at its peril! The societies most likely to strike the right balance between old hierarchies and new social networks will be the open societies, where appropriate regulation of big tech companies is more likely to be worked out than in closed societies.</p><p>The following are excerpts from reviews of The Square and the Tower:</p><p>\"Niall Ferguson has again written a brilliant book. . . .In 400 pages you will have restocked your mind.

He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior Fellow at the Center for European state at Harvard. He is also the Author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower. Networks empower from the Freemasons to Facebook.  </p><p>      Niall, thanks so much for joining us today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Great to be here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  So we were just talking with Mike about President Trump and the looming government shutdown, if that happens. I want to start first with the presidency with you because in the past, you have called his presidency a comedy rather than a tragedy.  </p><p>      We've seen the administration scramble to perhaps a government shutdown, while at the same time saying may be a shutdown will be good. No matter what happens though, the base and his support is still there. Is it a wise move for the President right now to be pinning everything on the base staying with him as he touts the economy doing well and the stock market doing well, that can all go up in flames very quickly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  It could. We all know that financial markets have a way of surprising that the bull market is forever. And there have been many people, my colleague at Harvard Martin Feldstein just this weekend in the general who've warned that a correction could come along and spoil that post of Donald Trumps argument.  </p><p>      But on the other hand if you look at that approval rating of his, it has not been taking off in the last few --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  From a little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  From a historic a little bit. Remember he was the most unpopular President at the outset, since polling began. And he didn't get any more popular in his first year. But you begin to see the possible inflection point here as the economic good news just keeps on coming in. Plus it's a point that Trump is getting some wins on foreign policy, there aren't really anything like enough airtime.  </p><p>      I mean, he can change the policy in Iran and by the end of last year. Iran was in a state of upheaval. He took a much tougher line on North Korea. And now guess what, the North Korean's and South Korean's are making nice with one another.  </p><p>      So, one of the things that ordered by the Trump Presidencies is the way that he tend to shoot himself with that Twitter feed of his. And if he tweeted less and said fewer off the cuff races things that shocked so many peoples unjustly, we would be focusing more on the outcomes. We'd be focusing more on what's actually getting done.  </p><p>      And I think that would in fact reflect much better on him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Do you think he's undermining he's own success?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, I think the strategy is come up in raging liberal by being outrageous has one benefit. That is that seems to force Democrats to the left. And I think on sees (ph) this on the immigration issue. It's quite good from a Republicans strategic point of few, if the Democrats become more and more committed to sanctuary cities to the undocumented.  </p><p>      A lot of Republicans don't feel good about that at all. But my sense is that the cost and benefits of the President's populist outrage are kind of finally poised at this point. And I'm not sure he's necessary net better off with some of the most outrageous things that he said of late.  </p><p>      I think if he'd said much less over the last let say 12 months. And focus more on the achievements, he'd be riding higher in the polls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Do you think we've seen the loads as far as the politics concerns because as many aspects now already short-term and longer-term are playing to his favor, if we keep the tweeting aside?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Right. I mean, one of the things I've tried to argue in The Square and the Tower is that we have a new kind of politics.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Which some of the still struggling to get ahead around is the public spear that's no longer dominated by network television, that's increasingly dominated by social media and the President has shown himself to have much better understanding not just the Twitter but the Facebook than his political rivals.  </p><p>      So one thing I did learn over two years of thinking and writing about Donald Trump is don't underestimate him and don't make the mistake of judging him by conventional measure. One thing I did recently was to just to run an experiment. I ask myself leaving aside personalities.  </p><p>      What presidency is this dislike? I mean this like the first year of Nixon and a lots of people have drawn that parallel, there's a lot of Democrats who would love this to be Watergate all over again is even the movie by Spielberg and go watch, you'd fantasize that.  </p><p>      You know, the Washington Post bringing down Donald Trump. It's not really like Nixon's first year at all, its much more like Bill Clinton first year. Go back and read woodward the agenda, change the names and you can have the version of what we've seen in the last year.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  We're going to talk more about (INAUDIBLE) Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower is staying with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  We're back with Niall Ferguson. He is author of the new book \"The Square and the Tower\", Networks Empower from the Freemasons to Facebook. So we were just talking before about the sort of fundamental basis of this book and what it means and actually where Donald Trump sits in between the interplay between hierarchies in history and social network.  </p><p>      And how they've evolved overtime, he is someone who harness in a unique way like thinking political terms at least at that point in time, the power of social network and what that mean for democracy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, in someway in the Brexit referendum was like the over the chart of the main show in 2016 because the leave campaign used Facebook as an advertising tool and just the way of the Trump campaign did.  </p><p>      But this book is about showing how social networks have always been there. It's not like Marks (ph) of Caberg (ph) invented them. All that Facebook did was to make them bigger and faster than they ever were before. But throughout history there have been periods when a new networks have come along and disrupted established hierarchies, those big tower of power that usually rule.  </p><p>      And my favorite example is from 500 years ago when the printing press completely disrupted European politics, causes the reformation Martin Luther without the printing press would just been birth at the state like hierarchy (ph). And we've never averted him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  When you got the day off on Monday.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  It's true. So that certain that's another Martin Luther, that Martin the King introvertly and so had a social network, in the civil rights wouldn't have work if they haven't been this network of churches in the South that had the people organized and should cancel their commitment when it came to often very hazardous demonstration.  </p><p>      Social networks all that you don't need the internet to have them. All we've done is making them bigger and faster and I think more powerful than they've been certainly anytime in the last 400 or 300 years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  And easier to corrupt as well, because of the platform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Right, this is the problem that makes it different from the age of printing press. There wasn't one person who owned over printing press is in 16th or 17th century Europe whereas social networks today are very concentrated and their ownership.  </p><p>      And this point of view, it's kind of extraordinary, these quasi-monopolies that have emerged online and seach, you've got Google retail, you've got Amazon, and of course in social media we've got Facebook.  </p><p>      This is extraordinary power. Facebook is the biggest content publisher in all of history. Zuckerberg is more powerful than William Randolph Hearst or Rupert Murdoch, any previous proprietor of the media organization.  </p><p>      And yet, Facebook is regulated as if it's a tech platform, not a content publisher. And that seem to me an extraordinary anomaly considering that 45 percent of Americans are getting their news from Facebook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Facebook is also reluctant to take on mental (ph) of assuming responsibility, should they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Also now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, they're indeed. And it's one of the key arguments that I think will play out in the coming years. Is it a content publisher? If it is, should it be liable for all the content that appears and the content, his vast in his content (ph).  </p><p>      I mean every now and then they'll say that they're hiring 10,000 people to bet the content. I mean come on the sheer scale of the content that is if you're Facebook he's going to require many, many more than 10,000 fact checkers.   </p><p>      I think this us a big issue. A lot of discussion on the big tech companies recently has been about anti-trust. I think that is a complete red herring. These are natural monopolies, you couldn't break them up. It's not going to happen. And the law, I don't think would support antitrust actions against these companies.  </p><p>      But I think the exemptions from liability for content that we're establishing mid 1990's when Facebook didn't even exist, those look like a vulnerability and I would just surprise if legislators and regulators begun to ask questions about that in the coming months  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  What about for somebody like Amazon and the power that they continue to accrue or Google for that matter? Like who disrupts the ultimate disruptive that they've been in such a small space of time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, if I were Jeff Bezos, I wish I were. But I would be worried much more about my rivals in Asia. I'd be looking at Alibaba, I'd be looking at Jack Ma and I'd be thinking, you know, I thought I was going to own the rest of world and you would just of China.  </p><p>      I begin to wonder and I just was Hang Joe (ph) looking at what's going on. Alibaba could it be that the big Chinese tech companies are about to make a push for market share outside of China, and we might find the U.S. companies beginning to lose that. That would be my worry at Amazon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Niall Ferguson, Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is going to stay with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Let's talk a bit more now about Bitcoin. We're back with Niall Ferguson. He says Bitcoin mega pot but the revolution will go on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, I said that when it was around about I think 1900 and it did go drop (ph). I have to tell about the story --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  You should be trading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know. The first thing should be trading is my son. So when he's 15th, it's now 18th now some back he said to me \"Dad, you really should buy Bitcoin.\" And pompously I Professor Ferguson says \"Young man, what do you know about financial history, this can never work. And I would call Jamie Dimon I almost said tulips (ph).  </p><p>      Well, I kind of learn the hard way. He was right. And I can got -- that caught up last year and began to really think about this. And we're amidst of an Amazing financial revolution which isn't just about Bitcoin. It's about Blockchain generally and what Blockchain can do.  </p><p>      I think a lot of people have got, you got confused by the term cryptocurrency. And because I'm not sure that we're going to produce a new form of money this way. But we have produced, what Bitcoin has produced is, number one, a new kind of store of value and may be more importantly a speculative object with more volatility than any other financial market. And, you know, for some people that's attractive including my son.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Three years ago, he was (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Like $350 (ph) was the price. If I had listen to him I wouldn't have to run around New York City doing institute like, you know, I've been (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Does he still own it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  I wish, he would say not nearly enough because don't think he landscape (ph) in the room to make a message something like three.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Wow (INAUDIBLE). But on paper he's doing pretty well right now. He reminds me of this on a regular basis. I mean the correction interesting. I had one thing that I came to see last year was that there would a correction because it has a classic bubble quality to it.  </p><p>      All those ICOs that initial coin offering were plastic bubbles. On territory a lot of it almost certainly fraudulent but I must say, I decided that 10,000 was the entry point. So when it went below 10, this week, I'm afraid I became a buyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Wow, for disclosure. Niall Ferguson, Bitcoin owner.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Yes, only my son's advice.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Wow. Now we have to see Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\" is staying with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Now still with us, is Niall Ferguson, he's new book \"The Square and the Tower\" looks at tensions in Silicon Valley between hierarchies and networks. And of course, not just in Silicon Valley but in countries and societies around the world.  </p><p>      Niall, let's talk a little bit about Uber here because is this a network in a same way that Facebook is a network or Twitter is a network? Or is it just a very narrow business in which Travis Kalanick has been able to ride the Silicon Valley wave?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  It was definitely a network business and ride sharing (ph) was a classic example of what you could do with what people called society market, the goal was to establish just the kind of dominance that had been established by Facebook and social network, Google and search et cetera.  </p><p>      And I think what's important here. I've read the story that you just talked about. It's not just the missteps Travis Kalanick made personally. It's also the fact that, I think he personified a certain Silicon Valley arrogance that I use to characterize as resistance is futile.  </p><p>      The attitude was, we have this awesome app, there's no point standing in our way. We will take the world one city at the time. And I can remember talking. We've seen another about this saying, you know, what is going to be different in Berlin. It's going to be different in China.  </p><p>      And indeed I write in the book about why it was the ultimately Uber lost the battle in China to Didi, which is an amazing story. And a typical story of what is going on in the world today, because these race if you like for dominance of these two sided markets is a race that's been run not just by U.S. companies but also by Chinese companies.  </p><p>      By the way, not by European companies, very interesting that Europe hasn't produced really any technology giants. And I think this races to relatively early stage. It's not clear who will really be dominant for example in global online retail 10 years from now. And my hunch is it won't necessarily be Amazon.  </p><p>      If you go talk to the people at Alibaba, they'll say we have a better understanding of emerging markets and we're going to own not just china, we're going to own Eurasia, and then move on to Africa and Latin America and leave you guys the United States, that would be a really remarkable turn of events that it happened.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Do point that Travis though seems to be making, would be seemingly making to you that there was a regulator that so far behind.  </p><p>      The technology innovation go so fast, that actually they've got a potential hit and move into all these different markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  And not necessarily worry so much. At one point in the story he was on his knees calling saying, I'm so terrible. He then jump up to go back into that meeting and was that, we have a P.R. problem. That there's no cultural problem there, we have a P.R. problem. At what point is that relevant for such a huge network and so many networks around the world that we have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  I think that's a very Silicon Valley response to a problem. And it's not yet that different from the way Facebook initially responded when people started to say, hey, you know, you played something of a destabilizing role in the 2016 election.  </p><p>      Mark Zuckerberg initial reaction was, the idea that fake news on Facebook had anything to do with this result is crazy. Well, of course, the tone quickly changed but at first the response is always, we have a P.R. problem, go fix the P.R., rather than recognizing. But sometimes the problems are very fundamental.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  So respond or break?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  I think there has to be a bigger response than we've seen so far. These companies have become enormously powerful with huge markets shares. I don't think there's ever going to be a successful breakup. I think antitrust won't work.  </p><p>      But I do think we need to think about the implications, particularly in the realm of our public sphere, of having a very small number of companies dominating online advertising, you know, Mike Bloomberg himself said just last year there has to be some liability for the content that these network platform produce.  </p><p>      I agree with that wholeheartedly. It's an anomaly that the biggest content publishers are being regulated as they just tech companies. And I think you're right. The regulators are behind as they are with Bitcoin, as they're with cryptocurrency.  </p><p>      But history tells us that no matter how rapidly a network grows, the regulators, the government eventually catches up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  But the network itself has a backlash go with Didi Uber (INAUDIBLE). Where network itself then that was responds and try to politic change.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  And there is something about backlash for Facebook too, just beginning to make itself felt.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Right. Niall Ferguson Author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you for that.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Still with us Niall Ferguson and just being that's going to be an interesting vote in Pennsylvania for Trump here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Absolutely, Pennsylvania a key state for him in 2016. It's a place where he'll be looking to mobilize those voters as he turn back in November.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Why do you think his popularity is still so high? There's so much resilience there, even as we talk earlier about his missteps, for instance sounding off on Twitter, making these comments that don't help him, where he shoots himself in the foot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, somewhere around about a third, maybe for 35 percent and may be 40 percent of voters are very solidly pro Trump. And I don't think it's just his larger than life personality. There was content to Trump's campaign. Sometimes this is forgotten in all the discussion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  But the content changes a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Yes, but the message when he ran was I'm going to do something about immigration, I'm going to do something about trade, free trade. I'm also going to tackle the perception that Washington is corrupt and it's a swamp.  </p><p>      And I think those votes were attracted by that message are prepared to cut Donald Trump an awful lot of slack as long as they feel that he is still roughly pointing in that direction and as long as they feel that he connects with them.  </p><p>      And I do think his ability to connect with people in Middle America, considering the man is a wealthy New York real estate developer by origin is amazing. But it's real. And I think that's the key, his ability to talk to them in the sometimes off-color language that they relate to.  </p><p>      So those people are not going to defect, and from the Republican establishment's point of view, they can't deserve Donald Trump. You can't give away a third of the electorate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes. The question is, can he do anything wrong in their eyes. We're going to come back to this conversation.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  We're back with Niall Ferguson. The author of \"The Square and the Tower\". Trump in Davos, how's that going to g?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  It won't go that bad. I mean, they're going to talk to him with rough legs, are they? It's Davos, he's the president that Klaus Schwab will be polite. They'll be plenty of applause. I guess he'll give a speech somewhat like his Warsaw speech. And I'll be OK.  </p><p>      I mean, Davos hate Trump and what he stands for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  He's antithesis (ph) of the Davos.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean he basically hates some globalization and that's what they're about. On the other hand he's powerful. He's the President of the United States and Davos also like power. So I thin -- he'll get kind of polite somewhat frosty reception.  </p><p>      But I think the interesting thing about Davos is that it is the network of network. I mean that's where people go who live to network. And it's the very high end network. The question will be, what will go on behind the scene, I don't really care about the speeches and sessions. What's important at Davos is the meetings.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Who's at piano bar at midnight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Correct. And I know suppose Trump will there. At lease his handlers where he want him to be at the piano bar at midnight. But may be interesting meetings going on back stage in those meetings rooms and some of the big hotels.  </p><p>      The interesting to see that any of the leaders, the European leaders for example Macron will be there. The French President Emmanuel Macron, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They going to meet with Trump. If anything going to get done, that's for me the interesting point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  What's the most important meeting for him do you think?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, I think that if you think back to the way Macron played him with that eternal handshake, the longest handshake in diplomatic history.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  We've already seen that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Well, the question really is can Macron help Trump in Europe. Trump is deeply unpopular in Europe even more unpopular than in Manhattan harder that is to believe. And yet, Trump is actually being winning on the key issue, which is being European contribution to NATO. He's kind of won that argument, they had to fold because he was right.  </p><p>      I sense there's a possibility that relationship with France can yield something for the United States and compensate for Trump's deep on popularity amongst European population.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  There some little bit of bromance there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERGUSON</emphasis>:  Definitely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Niall Ferguson author of \"The Square and the Tower\", thank you so much.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFM-8FP1-JDPT-T060-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

However, Niall Ferguson, author of The Square and the Tower, argues that networks are not a new phenomenon and have been impacting human culture from the beginning of history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Niall Ferguson and Peter Robinson discuss networks and hierarchies throughout history in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Ferguson breaks down what he means by networks and hierarchies using the imagery of the Piazza Del Campo in Siena, where the Torre del Mangia, representing the hierarchy, casts a long shadow over the Piazza Del Campo, representing the network. Ferguson argues that this powerful imagery invokes the essence of his book and the intertwined nature of networks and hierarchies within society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ferguson goes on to discuss the importance of networks in social movements throughout history, including Martin Luther and the Reformation, Paul Revere and the American Revolution, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union, and social media and Donald Trump. He argues that a networked world is a dangerous world, in that it allows movements and societies to advance in unexpected ways.</p><p>About the Guest:</p><p>Niall Ferguson, MA, DPhil., is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a senior fellow of the Center for European Studies, Harvard, where he served for twelve years as the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History.

I was wrong about that.\" The response of our guest today, \"If the Twitter co-founder had known his history, he would not have been surprised.\" Historian, Niall Ferguson, on Uncommon Knowledge now.</p><p>Theme Music Plays</p><p>Peter Robinson: Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge, I'm Peter Robinson. Now a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, Niall Ferguson has taught at institutions including, Oxford, Cambridge, the Stern School of Business, the London School of Economics, and Harvard. The author of a dozen major works on economics, military history, and diplomacy, Professor Ferguson has just published The Square and the Tower. Niall Ferguson, welcome.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Thanks, Peter.</p><p>Peter Robinson: To explain why this book is called The Square and the Tower, the reader must come with me to Siena. Explain that Niall.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, this is a book about networks and hierarchies, but I wasn't allowed to call it networks and hierarchies because hierarchies is one of those words publishers don't like.</p><p>Peter Robinson: On sales books.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: And so I thought, what can I call a book that is about the relationship between informal networks, social networks, and hierarchical structures of power, and I suddenly remembered Siena, a beautiful town in Tuscany that reached its zenith in the century before the Black Death. If you go to Siena, and I urge all viewers to do this, you will see the most perfect juxtaposition of a square and a tower. The Torre del Mangia which is this extraordinary beautiful tower, casts a great shadow over the main Piazza in the center of Siena, and that's the symbol I was looking for. I hadn't been there since I was in my twenties, but I've always thought of Siena when I've been trying to understand the relationship between government in the sense of hierarchical power structures and informal social networks of the sort that you find in town squares.</p><p>Peter Robinson: We'll come to Luther in a moment, but to quote again from the big themes first, The Square and the Tower, \"This book distinguishes the long epochs in which hierarchical structures dominated human life from the rarer but more dynamic eras when networks had the advantage.\"</p><p>Peter Robinson: So, explain that. When we think of networks, often we think of Silicon Valley. You are taking a much longer view. Give us, ... as they say, we'll come to Luther in just a moment, but the longer view hierarchies tend to predominate.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, when I moved out to be a full time Hoover Fellow at Stanford, I became a next door neighbor of Silicon Valley, and I was amazed, this is just over a year ago now, by how utterly indifferent to history people in that world are. In fact, in their view, history began with the Google IPO, or the founding of Facebook, and everything before that is the Stone age. So, part of the point of this book is to explain to the world of Silicon Valley, you did not invent networks. Social networks go back to the very dawn of human history. We are designed by evolution to network, but for most of history, informal social networks have been subordinated to hierarchical power structures. And there's a good reason for that. A lot of human history is to do with conflict, and early human structures, even before states, simple villages had always to be concerned with defense. And so a great deal of early human history is essentially about command and control. Networks, informal networks are not very good at defense. We can explore the significance of that for modern times in a minute, but back in the day, if we go all the way back to pre-history, somebody has to be in charge, somebody has to give the orders and the foot soldiers have to obey. So, for most of history, the tower overshadows the square. Indeed, that's part of Siena's symbolism. The tower's nearly always casting a shadow over the square. There are just occasional periods in history, we're in one of them now, when technology and other factors empower the networks and weaken the hierarchies.</p><p>Peter Robinson: And one more of the major themes of the book, you're a professional historian, \"This book is an attempt to atone for sins of omission.\" Explain that.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, if Silicon Valley's ignorance of history, I'm afraid historians are very ignorant about network science, and I plead guilty to having spent much of my career writing about networks without understanding the first thing about how networks function. Now, I've always been drawn temperamentally to study social networks. I didn't quite know that about myself until quite recently, but when I look back over 25 years of writing, I've written relatively little about kings, and queens, and indeed governments. I've written a lot more about networks, like for example, the network of Jewish bankers that was so important in 19th and 20 century history.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Your book The House of Rothschild.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: The House of Rothschild and the book I wrote about Siegmund Warburg, and I wrote a book about the British Empire, which is really a book about social networks and globalization.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Okay, good. Stop and explain all three of those. Banking, international banking networks. Why is the banking system in network instead of a hierarchy?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, a credit system by its very nature is a distributed network, whether it's of banks or simply borrowers and lenders, there's not really that much hierarchical structure in a credit system. Now, we invented, relatively recently, central banks to preside over financial systems, but in practice, when you look at the international financial system in the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries, and into the 21st, it's more readily intelligible as an enormous network. And it became a much more complex network with the advent of technology in the 1980s, '90s, and into the 2000s, and we ended up with an astonishingly complex financial network, so complex that the people who thought they were running it, the central banks, completely lost control of it for a time. They didn't realize in 2008, the one single node in the network called Lehman Brothers, was so important to the network, that if you let it fail, the entire network of international credit would come crashing down. That was an aha moment for me and indeed for some central bankers. And I talk about this in the book. In some ways, the financial system became networked before everybody else did. 2008, it was mostly people in finance who were truly networked. The rest of us hadn't quite got there. The network platforms that made social networks like Facebook possible, came later. Now, we're all as networked as the financial system was in 2008.</p><p>Peter Robinson: You mentioned the British empire and what I'm trying to do is draw out a clear distinction between networks and hierarchies. So, to my mind, if you say British Empire, the first thing that comes to my mind is almost a great chain of being, Queen Victoria's at the top and the lowly sergeant major in some godforsaken village in India is at the bottom, and there's taking orders all the way up and all the way down, and you were saying that no, that's the wrong way to look at the British empire.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: As a general statement, I think it is true that most organizations have a kind of pyramidal structure, and there's an org chart on the CEO's wall or indeed the prime minister's office wall that shows that the CEO or prime minister is at the top and everybody else is in a sense reporting to that person, and that was true of the British Empire too. There are lots of lovely wall charts that put Queen Victoria at the top of a great chain of being that extends down to the lowliest Indian peasant, but in all these cases, there is another way of graphing the institution, graphing the organization, and that is its network structure. Who is really talking to whom? Who is really in a close relationship with whom? That network, whatever institution you're talking about, will look different from the org chart. And then the British Empire's case, although officially, Queen Victoria was the empress of all she surveyed, that wasn't really how the British Empire worked. It wasn't as if she issued orders that were then carried out in lowly villages. Actually, the British empire was built by networks of traders, and networks of missionaries, and networks of Oxford educated orientalists. It was very de-centralized, it's pretty hard to control what's happening in India from London even today, and in that sense, I think you're right to point out there is not a perfect distinction between networks and hierarchies. To be absolutely clear, a hierarchy is a special kind of network. It's a kind of network where there are missing edges. The nodes are not all connected. Most nodes can only get to the other nodes through a central node. That's what a hierarchy really is. Whereas, the distributed network is one in which most nodes are connected to most other nodes, there isn't one single central node through which all the others have to go. Now, that's the network science part that I didn't understand when I was writing about networks 10 years ago, but now I do.</p><p>Peter Robinson: So, as a kind of summary opening statement, is this fair that, and I'm trying to relate this to experiences that almost all of us have. I'm thinking of my kids now who are just reaching the age where they're getting their first jobs, and here's the difference between a hierarchy and a network. The hierarchy is the organization chart, which is visible to every employee on his first day of his or her first day of work, the network is composed of a series of those aha moments when you say, 'oh, so this is the way it really works,' and that's the person you really need to talk to if you want to get that done, right.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Exactly.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Okay, okay. Got it.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: At the water cooler is often the place that reveals who really calls the shots. I remember having that experience at Oxford University as an undergraduate, discovering that really the college porter was the powerful people and the man who was president of Magdalen had least power of all. In fact, university is a good introduction to this world because they're not really very hierarchical institutions at all. Formally, there were people called deans, presidents, vice chancellors, but they're really quite weak relative to all those impossible academics, and yet impossible academics think of themselves as members of a republic of letters. I think that's what attracted me to universities as a young person. I always hated a command structure. I loathed the military. I didn't really like corporate life either. I don't like having a real boss. And so temperamentally, I'm a networks person. And one way of thinking about this, which your viewers might find helpful is to ask the question, am I a hierarchy person or a network person? Do I instinctively think first of all, of the chain of command, I report to him and they report to me? Or do I more instinctively think of that network, informal network of friends, acquaintances, and indeed family? That's the thing that a network can naturally gravitates towards. And then real networkers don't believe in the org charts, or at least they regard them as a kind of facade behind which the real power structures lie as networks.</p><p>Peter Robinson: All right. Now, we come to Martin Luther, 500 years ago and even 500 years ago, because you're writing here about tension between hierarchy ... By the way, I better stipulate. The book is full of one historical example, after another. You bring in Rome, you bring in John Buchanan's novel, Greenmantle. I mean, it's amazing how your mind finds connections across the kind of vast compendium of his history. This is a little television chat program, and we won't get very far. We will get to Luther. 500 years ago, he presents his 95 theses to the Archbishop of Mainz setting in train a series of events that you argue would anticipate the rise of Silicon Valley five centuries later. I'm quoting, \"Luther was as much of a utopian as the pioneers of Silicon Valley in our own time, utopian, but the true upshot of the Reformation was not harmony, but polarization and conflict.\" All right, give all of that to us.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, if we are to understand our own time, we need to use the right analogies and I don't think our own time is much like the 20th century. A time when very hierarchical states were in almost total control of social networks. You need to go much further back in time to find a period when the networks really could challenge the hierarchies, and that time was the 16th and 17th century. A time when a new technology, which was very network friendly, called the printing press, allowed the message of a heretic, critic of the church, Martin Luther to go viral. If Martin Luther had done what he did in 1517, in 1417, he would just have been burned at the stake and we'd never have heard of him. But Luther's message in 1517 could go viral, not just in Germany, but all over Europe because of the printing press. So for me, this is a really powerful analogy and there are some excellent academic work that shows that the impact of the printing press on say, the cost of the printed work, the cost of the page or of the book, and the volume of books produced was very like the impact of the personal computer. In our time, the same drastic fall in the price of information and increase in the volume of information, it's very much the same pattern, and it's had similar consequences I think. Now, Luther, as you said, was a utopian. He thought that if everybody could read a printed version of the Bible and have a direct relationship to God, then everything would be awesome. Well, he didn't quite put it like that. He said there would be something like the priesthood of all believers, which is a vision in early Christianity too, except that's not what was produced by the Reformation. In fact, the Reformation produced polarization, some people agreed with Luther, some people wanted to go even further than Luther, Calvin for example, but other people said, \"No, this is completely wrong, and we need to fight this.\" And then the counter Reformation adopted some of the techniques that had pioneered and turned against the Protestants. So, we had 130 years of religious conflict in Europe extending right into the middle of the 17th century. In our time, I think something very similar happens, a new technology beginning in around the 1970s, hugely transformed the public sphere in ways that we're only still gradually beginning to understand. Then, as in the Reformation, it was a utopian vision. Everybody would be connected. There would be a global community. Mark Zuckerberg's phrase, the founder of Facebook. Do we have a global community today? I don't think so. What we have is the same phenomena, polarization and crazy stuff going viral. In the 17th century, belief in witchcraft went viral as much as Martin Luther's sermons had in the 16th century. In our time, it's not just cat videos that get shared online, it's fake news, and extreme views.</p><p>Peter Robinson: And you also argue that the dream, that one component of this, Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook motto used to be, \"Make the world more open and connected.\" I've already quoted the Twitter co-founder, Evan Williams, who said, \"Once we're all connected, the world will simply be a better place just because it will be.\" One component of that hopeful vision was, in one way or another, we'd all be equal. Everyone would have access to information. Education would be ... and in one way or another, incomes would tend to level out. To the contrary, we've got stagnation of middle-class wages in this country, and vast fortunes, tens of billions to Zuckerberg, and Sergey Brin, and Larry Page, and Jeff Bezos, the moguls of the networked world. And you argue what? That this is a temporary anomaly, that more competition and more technology will come along, and incomes will tend to be equalized, or that inequality is a direct artifact output of the networked world?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: The latter.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Such a cheerful book you've written here.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: The dream. Well, it's a dream, it was a dream, wasn't it? We were all going to be netizens and everybody was going to be, as it were, on a level playing field in a giants network. But in fact, that's not what network science predicted at all. As social networks grow, they don't grow in a kind of equal way where new nodes attach themselves randomly to the existing nodes in the network. The new nodes have a preference to be attached to the well-connected nodes. And so, the already well-connected become even more connected. The rich get richer, the fit get fitter, the connected get more connected. So, when you look at networks from the vantage point of a physicist, like the Great Laszl Barabasi, what you find is that the networks are the least egalitarian of structures. As they grow, the returns, connectedness get more and more concentrated in a few hands. We who use social networks, who are the users, should be distinguished clearly from those who own them, and the ownership of the giant network platforms is incredibly concentrated. And as you mentioned, it has made billionaires of a relatively small number of people in Silicon Valley. So, one of the ... I think, unintended consequences, and there have been many, but one of the most important unintended consequences of the internet age has been to amplify, to reinforce inequality by allowing connectedness to become an incredible source of wealth as well as influence.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Dr. Kissinger, The Square and the Tower. \"It was as I reached the halfway stage of my biography of Henry Kissinger with volume one finished.\" Brilliant book. We've spoken about it on this program, \"And volume two, half-researched.\" Hurry up, if you wouldn't mind, \"That an interesting hypothesis occurred to me. Did Kissinger owe his success, fame, and notoriety, not just to his powerful intellect and formidable will, but also to his exceptional ability to build a network.\" I'm going to come to the answer, but first the question; What was it about Kissinger that made you suspect there was something exceptional going on here? That the network was unusual?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: This is really why the book came to be written. One book leads to another, and volume one of Kissinger left me with a puzzle; How had this pretty academic individual become so influential so quickly after he entered governments in 1969 as Richard Nixon's National Security Advisor? And the hypothesis was that quite deliberately, Henry Kissinger built a network, not just of people in the administration with whom he worked, in fact, he was kind of dismissive of the org chart of the federal government, but more importantly, with people outside it, in the media particularly, but even more eclectically to Hollywood, and then of course to other countries, to the leaders, and foreign ministers, and ambassadors of other countries. So, my hypothesis, and this will be a big part of volume two, is that Kissinger understood that the world was moving away from mid-20th century hierarchies, from the days of totalitarian leaders and imperial presidents, into a new world in which networks would really be crucial. And perhaps by instinct or perhaps by design, he very rapidly became the most networked man in the world, so that by 1973, this was being acknowledged. I came across a terrific profile, I think in Newsweek, which makes this point about him, that he is the most connected man in the world. With the help of a very brilliant former student of mine, Manny Rincon-Cruz, we actually graphed the Kissinger network.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Which I actually I'm going to display for you.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Which I am glad you are showing, because it's one of my favorite bits of artwork from the book, and this was quite a labor of love. Looking at all the connections between all the people who served in the Nixon or Ford administrations and wrote memoirs, that's the sets of people that I looked at.</p><p>Peter Robinson: So, talk us through this network. There's Richard Nixon, right in the middle. That's what you'd expect, but what would you ... What is unexpected? What is this specially telling about Henry Kissinger's network?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: This is what's known in the trade as an ego network. It shows all the most important relationships that Kissinger has ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: And this is derived from his memoirs. So, the number of times he mentioned someone, is that right?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Exactly. So, we can see who the important people were, at least in Kissinger's memory of his time in government, and what you find is, not surprisingly, that Nixon himself is the most important, and Ford is also pretty important. Proximity and size of the node tell you those things, but then you notice that foreign leaders are as important as Americans in this network graph. Whether it's Brezhnev, or the North Vietnamese negotiator, Le Duc Tho.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: So, I think what you can do with a graph like this is be precise about which relationships mattered most to Kissinger. Now, I think this is a good illustration of why the network approach is helpful because he usually kind of casually make statements about important relationships, but this is a way of seeing who really mattered to him, at least in retrospect.</p><p>Peter Robinson: It's fascinating, Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States looks as important, maybe even a little bit more important than Gerald Ford ...</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Right.</p><p>Peter Robinson: ... who became president after Richard Nixon left office.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Which is telling you that Kissinger talks more about Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador than he does about one of the two presidents he served. And you could also make the point that foreign secretary of state, William Rogers, is a very unimportant node in this graph despite the fact that in the org chart of the Nixon administration, he was superior to Kissinger when he was National Security Advisor.</p><p>Peter Robinson: The Square in the Tower, you contrast Henry Kissinger's ego chart with Richard Nixon's. \"Nixon's inner circle was that a man confined within the walls of the White House.\" He's talking to his staff and that's about it. \"Kissinger by contrast, mentions key foreign leaders almost as much as the presidents he's served.\" Okay. So, that tells us Kissinger ... what does it tell us? I mean, there's almost a sense in which you want to just say, he was a good schmoozer.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, a good schmoozer is a kind of disparaging way of putting it, and you could also say, but of course, he was Secretary of State, he had a lot of relationships with foreign leaders, but the next step was to look at the ways in which the different members of the Nixon and Ford administration related to one another. Who mentions whom? If you take the entire universe of memoirs written from that time, and it turned out to be larger than I'd expected, lots of memoirs from that period, it's very striking how many people talk about Henry Kissinger. In fact, Henry Kissinger is the second most important node in that graph after Nixon himself. And that's an important piece of evidence for the argument that Kissinger really was the second most powerful man in that period of American government. And I think that's why this technique is useful. It forces you to be rigorous when you're talking about relationships. What you can't show the graphs like this very easily is the quality of relationships. It just shows you the people were connected. It doesn't tell you if they loved one another or hated one another or we're indifferent to one another, but I think this is a way that historians can be more rigorous in their analysis of social networks, of relationships, and after all, that's what a lot of politics is about.</p><p>Peter Robinson: So, in principle at least, if we had enough letters, if enough documents and letters survived, you could do an ego chart for every member of the Court of Henry VIII.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Absolutely.</p><p>Peter Robinson: And it would be very revealing probably.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: And indeed that work is being done.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Oh, is it done, it's being done? Really?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Yes. Some of the most enjoyable parts of writing this book were the reading of research by often young scholars looking at network analysis of the Court of Henry VIII, or for that matter, of the Protestant martyrs who lost their lives under his daughter, Bloody Mary, Mary I. So, I think this tool is being deployed more and more, and part of what The Square and the Tower does is to introduce this quite academic and quite technical literature to the general reader and say, you know what? This is happening a lot of different places. Think of the Enlightenment. Benjamin Franklin is a well-known figure, but did you know anything about his network of correspondence? You begin to see where Franklin fits into the Enlightenment network or the network of the American Revolution, which I got very excited about, which reveals that Paul Revere really was one of the crucial figures in the revolution by measures of network centrality. We can show that he was the connector in the network that made the American Revolution in Boston. And the reason Paul Revere's ride is famous is partly because it was Paul Revere. People believed what Paul Revere said because they were connected to him, they knew him.</p><p>Peter Robinson: I see. The squashing of networks, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution and the founding of the Soviet state. And the question is, did the USSR have anything to teach us about hierarchies and networks, and in your hands, the answer is it most certainly did. Tell us the story of Oxford philosopher, Isaiah Berlin, and the Russian poet, Anna Akhmatova.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Berlin and Akhmatova met a handful of times. The most memorable of their meetings was in Leningrad, in her apartment, one night, shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, November I think.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Right. Immediately after.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: This was a meeting of minds of kindred spirits. The philosopher and political thinker Berlin, who himself had been born in Russia, born in the Russian empire, and Akhmatova, one of the great poets of the 1920s who had been cast into outer darkness by Stalin because her poetry was not in conformity with socialist realism. It was an encounter between two intellectuals. They spent the night talking about poetry, reading poetry, and talking about art. When Stalin got wind of this encounter, he was furious and began to persecute Akhmatova again and her family. It led to her son being consigned to prison, to the labor camps again. And I tell this story because it illustrates that there have been times in human history when to network, to be in a social network was itself a criminal offense that could even lead to death. Stalin above all other leaders, distrusted any kind of networking that did not go on with his or at least the communist party's approval. His paranoia extended to eavesdropping even on a poet. And this is perhaps the quintessence of the hierarchical order that was totalitarianism. The Soviet Union was set up in the mid 20th century so that nobody could network with impunity and you did it at your peril. Networking without Stalin's approval could get you sent to the Gulag and even get you shot.</p><p>Peter Robinson: A contrast and a tentative conclusion, which I think is probably a little bit wrong, but you'll adjust it. Contrast with the Soviet Union is the United States, and one of the things that Tocqueville writes about, he visits the United States in the 1830s and he is struck by the richness of private associations, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associations of all kinds. And of course, reading your book, I think to myself, Tocqueville is seeing networks, he's seeing networks. Does the richness and variety of private networks in a nation represent a useful rough index of liberty? Should it be in some way an aim of policy to provide the kind of government that most easily permits networking?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Yes and yes.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Yes and yes, really?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Tocqueville was right that civil society was what made the United States successful as a democracy and the lack of it, the lack of a vigorous associational life was why France kept making a mess of democracy in his time. And I think that observation is one of the most profound of his career. What he was seeing when you traveled in early 19th century America was a networked society with a lot of very decentralized local decision making being taken by citizens without reference to central government. And Tocqueville was a great critic of the centralization of the French state, going back to the 18th century and into his own day, his constant warning was, centralization is the enemy of liberty, associational life and decentralization is the friend of liberty. This turns out to be true. Unfortunately, we didn't really hear Tocqueville in this country. In fact, if Tocqueville came back to the United States today and looked around, he would conclude that the French must have taken over the United States at some point and created a very powerful central government in Washington D.C, where we're having this conversation, which increasingly resembles the Paris that Tocqueville wrote so critically about in the 19th century. So, we've lost that magic that made the United States different. We've lost that vital association of life, we've lost that default setting that Americans used to have when confronted with a local problem, let's solve this together, let's not call in the federal government to solve it for us.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Donald Trump, China, and what comes next? The Square and the Tower, \"Candidate Donald trump completely dominated Hillary Clinton on both Facebook and Twitter. If the social media platforms have not existed, Trump would've been forced to conduct a more conventional campaign, in which case the greater financial resources of his opponent, who out-spent him by more than two to one, would surely have been decisive.\" Donald Trump is president today because his campaign is networked, while the Clinton campaign was hierarchical, true?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: That is the argument of my book and indeed something I've revisited in recent columns. More and more, I think, that Facebook and Twitter, these social networks or network platforms were crucial to Trump's victory in 2016, and if they have not existed, he would not have won. Now, everybody has their own pet theory as to why the election turned out the way it did, but I think people who on the eve of that election called it right, maybe in a stronger position than the people who said that Hillary Clinton had a 90% probability of winning and then subsequently, retrofitted their theories to the facts. I think the decisive variable must have been the social networks because it gave Trump tools, which were available to the Clinton campaign, but simply weren't used so effectively, to target advertising at key voters with great precision and at very low cost. It is much cheaper to do this and more effective than to go for old-style commercials paid for on TV, which I'm afraid the Clinton campaign was still heavily reliant on.</p><p>Peter Robinson: So, all of this sounds very odd, not wrong, but odd. Democratic Party is the party of youth, hipness, cool. Hillary Clinton won by a large margin among those millennials who chose to vote and you're saying that she was outmaneuvered by a septuagenarian real estate executive from Queens. So, we simply have to say the association of youth and networking is superficial at best. This is open to anybody who wants to grab it.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: It's more rich in irony than even you suggest because Silicon Valley itself, if you'd asked nearly all the senior executives, software products, ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: Not a lot of Trump supporters.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: ... they were all completely on board with Clinton. The campaign contributions overwhelmingly went to her, Eric Schmidt of Google was one of her campaign advisors. There was only really a handful of people in Silicon Valley who backed Trump, Peter Thiel being the bravest. So, what's amazing here is that the tools created by liberal elites, and they don't come much more liberal than Mark Zuckerberg, were the key to the success of the populous candidate and tools that were thoughts to be the property of youth turn out to be a very powerful instrument to mobilize middle aged and aging Americans in support of the populous candidate. This is the great irony of 2016, but we shouldn't be so surprised. Exactly the same thing had happened just a few months before in June 2016 in the Brexit referendum in Britain, where Facebook was very effectively used by the leave campaign to get predominantly older provincial voters to turn out in massive numbers. 90% turnout for voters aged 65 and older in the Brexit referendum.</p><p>Peter Robinson: 90%, really? I hadn't heard that figure. That's astonishing.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: So, that's the irony of all of this. And I think it was Brad Pascal who was Trump's digital media director who observed just the other day that they had designed these networks never imagining that they could be used to advance the cause of a populist, right-wing candidate. And this brings us back full circle to your Twitter founder quotation at the beginning. You know, we never thought that if we connected the world it would turn out this way. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook said not so long ago, \"We never thought our tools could be used in this way.\" You know, history is great because it's full of irony. This is Edward Gibbon class irony. Silicon Valley built the tools that propelled Donald Trump, a man they nearly all abhor, into the White House.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Niall, in concluding The Square and the Tower, you write about the great nation states, and the tensions, the rivalry between the United States and China, but you also make the point that there are now networks of economics and technology that extend across national borders. And I'm going to quote you. \"The key question is how far this network of economic complexity now poses a threat to the hierarchical world order of nation states. Can a networked world have order? In the light of historical experience, I very much doubt it.\" Explain.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, the typical Utopian view is that, it would be great to have a networked world, Anne-Marie Slaughter has written a whole book about this, but in fact, we should see that what happened at the national level in the 2016 election, can also happen at the global level if we leave it to the networks. My argument is that a networked world is a dangerous world. Networks in the 18th century ran out of control in France, produced a revolutionary eruption that turned Europe on its head. What was the solution to the problem of the rampant revolutionary networks?</p><p>Peter Robinson: Napoleon.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Napoleon Bonaparte, I'm in charge, at the return of hierarchy, and then an even more elegant solution; the pentarchy of five great powers that established themselves as the guardians of order at the Congress of Vienna. Now, this seems to me very instructive, because they said explicitly, \"We five great powers are dominant, the rest of you are subordinate to us and we will establish the rules of international order.\" My argument to the conclusion of The Square and the Tower is that we need some similar order, some similar hierarchical structure to the international order because if we just leave it to the networks, if we leave it to Facebook and Twitter, we were not going to end up with a global community of netizens all sharing cat videos, we're going to see the polarization, the viral manias happening on a global scale and not just in national elections. Plus, we know from 2016 the bad actors, whether it's ISIS or Russian intelligence can very easily hack the networks. I don't think Russia decided the election, but Russia certainly did nothing to hurt Donald Trump's chances with its interventions on Facebook and Twitter. So, a networked world is not a stable world at all, there needs to be some hierarchical order. I think it's not yet clear what kind of order can emerge. Certainly with Donald trump as president, I don't see a strategic plan in place yet. Some people say it'll just be a two power world order, the G2 or Chi-merica, China and the United States, maybe that will be the outcome. My own preference is that we take the existing pentarchy on the United Nations Security Council, the five permanent members, and make that the Congress of Vienna of the 21st century.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Can we put up with France for another century?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, what's the alternative? If you restructure the UN permanent members you're going to end up with even more awkward partners. The great thing about ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: You don't want the Germans on?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, I wasn't going to name any names, but if you did it on the basis of population, you'd be getting rid of France and bringing on India, Indonesia, can get very complicated if you go by population. The thing about the UN Security Council, and those viewers skeptical about the UN need to listen carefully here, is that it does have legitimacy globally, despite the fact that it's really quite arbitrary a remnant of past history, that the five permanent members are who they are.</p><p>Peter Robinson: The five are?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: The United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France. The winners, as it were, of world war II just happened to have a privileged position. The losers, don't call us, we'll call you, Germany, Japan. This is a very interesting setup to me because it reminds me of the Congress of Vienna, five powers that outrank the others that are permanently on the UN Security Council, and it has legitimacy. When the UN Security Council issues a resolution, the world pays a lot more attention to an issue than when it doesn't, take North Korea. So, I think one of the interesting paradoxes of our time is that an opportunity exists today to use the UN Security Council in a way that wasn't possible at all in the era after it was created. Because in the cold war, either the Soviets vetoed our resolutions or we vetoed theirs. So, one possibility here is that international order could be based on a pre-existing institutional structure that just hasn't worked before. It's a long shot, but if you think that China plus America is a better idea, I've got bad news for you, that's not enough. I don't think that creates nearly enough legitimacy for the rest of the world to buy in.</p><p>Peter Robinson: All right. Couple of last questions, where do you stand? Does your argument militate in the direction ... this is much in the news lately in Silicon Valley where you and I both live these days, where do you stand on the anti-trust issue? The notion that somehow or other, the legal framework doesn't seem to be adapted to it just now, but one way or another it would be better for America if Facebook, and Google, maybe Amazon, maybe Apple, but the giants were broken up in one way or at least constrained.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Well, this is an idea that's gaining ground on the left of the Democratic Party because they look back to the glory days of trust busting and they want to bring an antitrust back into their political vocabulary after a period when it's been more or less nonexistent. I think it's going nowhere, frankly. I don't think the law is going to be very helpful. Certainly, the tradition as the courts interpreted it in recent decades has been, you have to show that consumers are worse off ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: And they're better off.</p><p>Niall Ferguson:... and try that with Jeff Bezos, he'll show you that Amazon has made consumers much better off. I don't think that's where the big tech companies are vulnerable, they're natural monopolies. I don't think you can break them up the way standard oil was broken up, but I think they are vulnerable to increased regulation and I will be amazed if there is not a significant change in the regulation in the course of 2018, because the status quo just seems indefensible. Right now, Facebook is the biggest media publishing company in American history and yet it is regulated as if it is not one. It's regulated as a network platform with no liability for anything that appears in the platform. If that is still the case, a year from now, I will be stunned and it will I think be a major mistake on the part of lawmakers because that's an indefensible anomaly. And every time I hear Facebook executives say, \"We're not a content company, we're a tech company, we're a network platform.\" I say, pull the other one, it's got bells on, you are bigger now than William Randolph Hearst at the height of his power.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Which leads to another ... I keep thinking this is going to be the final question, I'm adding one more. What's the longer term prospect ...? Not even that, be five years from now, we now have a situation in which news is gathered and paid for by one set of entities, the traditional news organizations, and yet overwhelmingly the profits accrue to Facebook ... actually those two, Facebook and Google, advertising has shifted dramatically to Facebook and Google. Facebook alone earned as much in advertising last year as all the other media companies, all the traditional media companies in America combined, and Google earned a multiple of what Facebook earned in advertising. They don't pay for their news, they just take it. Are we old fashioned enough to believe that investigative journalism and pretty good commentary, informed commentary, remains essential to democracy, and if we do believe that, is the current situation tenable?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: No, the current situations is not tenable ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: It just plain isn't, is it?</p><p>Niall Ferguson:... but it's worse than you say.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Ah, keep cheering me up.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Because what happens when 45% of Americans at the last can't get their news from the Facebook Newsfeed, that is not some random aggregation of data. What happens in the Newsfeed is that the algorithm tries to decide what news the user will like or share and pay attention to because ...</p><p>Peter Robinson: It's literally trying to tell you what you want to hear.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Exactly, and what you like to hear, and what you like to share because that's how Facebook gets paid by advertisers, by showing that people are stuck to the content that they go to. So, we've created filter bubbles, echo chambers, whatever you want to call them, that completely dis-aggregate the old public sphere so that people have their own personalized newsfeeds, there no longer is a common conversation in America. Everybody is in his or her own little bubble and that's the most dangerous part of it. Look, my heart bleeds for the traditional publishers, but what's happened to them happened to music publishers years ago, it's just the latest internet disintermediation or disruption, whatever term you prefer, to befall a traditional business. And I feel equally sad for the traditional advertising agencies that are being given the same treatment. But we as citizens should be much more worried about what's happened to the public sphere in the age of Facebook and Twitter. We've talked about how it's been polarized, we've talked about how fake news and extreme views are more likely to go viral, but I think the ultimate threat to the stability of democracy is the disappearance of a national conversation and the creation of multiple personalized filter bubbles. That can't be good for us.</p><p>Peter Robinson: And do have a first draft at a solution? What would you propose?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: It's something I think a lot about when I do think that there needs to be at least a level playing field in terms of regulation. You can't go on pretending that Facebook's not publishing content, it's the biggest publisher of content there's ever been. Secondly, I think that therefore has to be liability for that content. Thirdly, that imposes a whole bunch of new costs on these companies because the sheer scale of the volume of content appearing on these platforms, remember there are more than two billion people using Facebook, all using it to post stuff, and comparable large numbers of advertisers using it to sell stuff. This is beyond editorial control, and whenever they try to reassure us that they're going to hire 10,000 people to look for bad content, fake news, or Russian propaganda, my response is the same as I already gave you, I pull the other one and it's got bells on. This is far, far larger as a problem than 10,000 editors can possibly address. So, I think what we'll see is a level playing field, increased liability for the network platforms, and a huge problem for them, which is how do you curate and edit content in such vast volumes that we have never seen anything like it before? We need to make that their problem and not our problem as citizens.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Niall, last question. It is in the nature of these programs that one really wants to end on an upbeat. And so I'm going to say to you, Niall, I hear by command you, Niall Ferguson, author of The Square and the Tower, what's the most hopeful aspect of the development of this networked world for the United States of America?</p><p>Niall Ferguson: The good news is that if you empower networks, there are good things that happen too. The Printing Press produced not only religious conflict, it produced the Scientific Revolution, it produced the Enlightenment, it produced the American Revolution, it produced the Industrial Revolution. These great leaps forward in human understanding happened because intellectuals and innovators were able to exchange ideas freely, publish them, or just correspond with one another in an enormous network that was global at its maximum extent. And we have something very similar today. The best thing about the internet is that it enables innovation and creativity to happen without any central control. Nobody is calling the shots on how we try to solve the great problems that face us today. And so when I'm being optimistic, I tell myself, it's all going to be fine, there may be disruption, there maybe polarization and crazy stuff may go viral, that happened in the 17th century. But remember what happened in the 18th century. The greatest breakthroughs in our political understanding, and the foundation of the greatest republic, perhaps the greatest polity in all of history, the United States of America, I don't believe China ends up owning this technology and therefore the 21st century. They're trying to, because essentially, the Chinese have their own network platforms that are under state control, that won't be better than what we've got here. So, the creativity of Facebook, the creativity of Google, these ultimately are assets to the United States. If they as companies thought a bit more nationally and a bit less globally, I think that would be good for them and good for us. What is good for Facebook should be good for the United States and vice versa. You could say that about General Motors in the 1950s, you can't yet say it about Silicon Valley, and it's high time that we did.</p><p>Peter Robinson: Niall Ferguson, author of The Square and the Tower, thank you.</p><p>Niall Ferguson: Thank you.</p><p>Peter Robinson: I'm Peter Robinson for Uncommon Knowledge and the Hoover Institution, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121864631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH3-PBG1-DYTH-G1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8377\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This was not unusual; part of Hankes' job at the civil rights organization was to track white supremacists online, which meant reading their sites. But as Hankes loaded the page on his computer at SPLC's headquarters in Montgomery, Alabama, something caught his eye: a pop-up window that announced \"Checking your browser before accessing &amp;#230; Please allow up to 5 seconds.\" In fine print, there was the cryptic phrase \"DDoS protection by Cloudflare.\" Hankes, who had worked at SPLC for three years, had no idea what Cloudflare was. But soon he noticed the pop-up appearing on other hate sites and started to poke around.</p><p>There's a good chance that, like Hankes, you haven't heard of Cloudflare, but it's likely you've viewed something online that has passed through its system. Cloudflare is part of the backend of the internet. Nearly 10 percent of all requests for web pages go through its servers, which are housed in 118 cities around the world. These servers speed along the delivery of content, making it possible for clients' web pages to load more quickly than they otherwise would. But Cloudflare's main role is protection: Its technology acts as an invisible shield against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks-hacker campaigns that disable a website by overwhelming it with fake traffic. The company has more than 7 million customers, from individual bloggers who pay nothing for basic security services to Fortune 50 companies that pay up to a million dollars a year for guaranteed 24-hour support.</p><p>Hankes wanted to learn something about Cloudflare's business, and what really interested him was finding out who Cloudflare was protecting. After a few months of research, he felt confident he'd uncovered something important, and on March 7, 2017, he penned a blog post that denounced Cloudflare for \"optimizing the content of at least 48 hate websites.\" Those sites included Stormfront, the grandfather of white-nationalist online message boards, and the Daily Stormer, at that time one of the most important hate sites on the internet. A virulently anti-Semitic publication, the Daily Stormer was founded in 2013 by a thuggishly enigmatic white supremacist named Andrew Anglin. (\"Total Fascism\" was the upbeat name of one of his earlier publications.) Without Cloudflare's protection, the Daily Stormer and those other sites might well have been taken down by vigilante hackers intent on eliminating Nazi and white-supremacist propaganda online. Hankes and the SPLC weren't accusing Cloudflare of spouting racist ideology itself, of course. It was more that Cloudflare was acting like the muscle guarding the podium at a Nazi rally.</p><p>Matthew Prince, the 43-year-old CEO of Cloudflare, didn't bother responding to the SPLC's pointed accusation. In fact, he has only the haziest recollection of hearing about it. He might have seen a mention on Twitter. He's not sure. Prince is a genial, Ivy League-educated Bay Area resident who once sat in on lectures by a law professor named Barack Obama-the type of person you would expect to have a vivid impression of being denounced by a prominent civil rights organization. But for Prince the criticism was nothing new. At Cloudflare, he was in the business of protecting all kinds of clients, including some whose views vaulted way outside the boundaries of acceptable discourse. He'd already been accused of helping copyright violators, sex workers, ISIS, and a litany of other deplorables. It was hardly a surprise to him that neo-Nazis would be added to the list. Come late summer, however, he would no longer be able to take that breezy attitude. Prince didn't realize it at the time, but that SPLC blog post was the first indication of the trouble to come. Five months later, Prince would be forced to make a very public decision about the Daily Stormer, one made against his own best judgment and that presented some of the thorniest and most perplexing challenges to free speech since the ACLU defended neo-Nazis who planned to march in Skokie, Illinois, 40 years ago.</p><p>How did an internet infrastructure company get locked into a vital free-speech dispute with a bunch of Nazis? That is a story that begins, like so many great tales, in the cubicles of San Francisco and the brothels of Istanbul.</p><p>In 2010, when Cloudflare first started, long before it counted customers in the millions, Prince and his cofounders, Michelle Zatlyn and Lee Holloway, installed a bell in their cramped SoMa offices. Whenever someone signed up for Cloudflare's services, the bell would ring and the 10 or so employees would all drop what they were doing to see who their new customer was.</p><p>One day in 2011, the bell rang and Prince went to see who had signed up. \"It was the moment where I was like, 'We need an employee handbook.' \" The new customer was a Turkish escort service that needed cyber-protection for a promotional website. But it was only the first. Within two weeks, some 150 Turkish escort sites had signed up for Cloudflare's services. The young outfit had somehow become a go-to service for the Istanbul sex trade.</p><p>Curious about this niche-business popularity, a Cloudflare employee contacted the webmaster at one of the escort sites. The webmaster had heard about Cloudflare from a friend who read about it on TechCrunch, and he explained why he sought the company's protection: Orthodox Muslim hackers had decided to take the law into their own hands and wipe the escort sites off the web. They had largely succeeded, until Cloudflare entered the picture.</p><p>To understand why the Turkish webmasters flocked to Cloudflare, you have to understand a bit more about where the company interjects itself into the invisible and near-instantaneous flow of bits that travel between an ordinary user and the servers that deliver the information. When you type a URL into a browser and hit Return, that request first goes out to a domain name server, which translates the human-readable URL (call it <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.turkishescort.com\">www.turkishescort.com</url>) into the numerical IP address of the web server that's hosting the content. At that point, a packet of bits is dispatched from the domain name server over to the hosting server, and the content you've requested is delivered back to your browser.</p><p>The trouble is that \"you\" might not be you at all. Your computer might be infected with malware that has commandeered it to serve in an army of zombie machines-a botnet-that hackers use to execute DDoS attacks. Your seemingly idle laptop might be helping to swamp an innocent website with thousands of requests per second, overloading the target's servers and making it impossible for legitimate requests to get through. That's where Cloudflare comes in.</p><p>Cloudflare protects against these attacks by inserting itself between the browser and host servers that contain the content. From the user's perspective, the experience is frictionless: You hit the bookmark for, say, a local newspaper and within a split second your screen fills with high school sports scores and reports on the mayoral race. But behind the scenes, your request for information has been filtered through one of Cloudflare's data centers.</p><p>\"At that data center,\" Prince explains, \"we'll make a series of determinations: Are you a good guy or a bad guy? Are you trying to harm the site? Or are you actually a legitimate customer? If we determine that you're a bad guy, we stop you there. We act essentially as this force shield that covers and protects our customers.\"</p><p>During a visit in September to Cloudflare's headquarters-now in more expansive offices in SoMa-Prince took me to the company's network operations center, where monitors line the walls, each filled with graphs and brightly colored blocks of text. These represented hundreds of different attacks being attempted in real time across the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare separates the good guys from the bad using pattern recognition. If it sees a familiar nefarious pattern breaking out, it will stop it, like a human immune system attacking a virus. The cyberattackers who went after the Turkish brothels exhibited a distinctive pattern; at Cloudflare, that fingerprint was dubbed the \"TE attack,\" as in Turkish Escorts.</p><p>About a year after the first Turkish escort site became a customer, Prince got a call from someone he calls a panicked \"Dutch gentleman.\" The caller was responsible for the website of the wildly popular Eurovision song contest. It was two days before the final showdown of the television talent show, and the site had been taken offline by a DDoS attack. When Cloudflare's security team looked at the data, they saw the family resemblance immediately: It was the TE attack. The Eurovision contest that year was being held in Azerbaijan, a predominantly Muslim country, and the hackers had decided that Eurovision should be knocked offline. Having seen the attack before, Cloudflare was able to get the site up and running in less than 30 minutes, plenty of time before the final rounds. Fast-forward another six months. Prince was summoned to a big financial firm in New York to help analyze a recent attack on its servers. In the conference room, the finance team slid their log files across the table to Prince and his colleagues. As they scanned the logs, smiles of recognition passed across their faces. It was the same maneuver the Turkish Escort attackers had used.</p><p>The TE attacks didn't just help Cloudflare impress Wall Street titans, they also taught the company something about the value of protecting objectionable content. A site that someone, somewhere, deeply despises is the type of site that is likely to be attacked. And when sites are attacked, Cloudflare gets better at what it does; its pattern recognition improves. \"Putting yourself in front of things that are controversial actually makes the system smarter,\" Prince says. \"It's like letting your kids roll around in the dirt.\" This is one of the reasons it makes sense for Cloudflare to offer a free self-service platform: By widening the pool of potential invasive agents, it makes the immune system more responsive. \"It's not obvious that a bunch of escorts that aren't paying you anything are good customers. It's not obvious that having people who get attacked all the time-including neo-Nazi sites-that you would by default want them to be on your network. But we've always thought the more things we see, the better we're able to protect everybody else.\"</p><p>Cloudflare has now logged millions of different kinds of attacks, each, like TE, with its own recognizable signature. This growing database of malice ultimately brought Cloudflare to its central, if largely invisible, position as an internet gatekeeper. The day before I visited Cloudflare's offices, 22,000 new customers signed up for its services. Needless to say, there is no longer a bell ringing for each one that signs up.</p><p>\"PUTTING YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THINGS THAT ARE CONTROVERSIAL ACTUALLY MAKES THE SYSTEM SMARTER. IT'S LIKE LETTING YOUR KIDS ROLL AROUND IN THE DIRT.\"</p><p>Matthew Prince grew up in Park City, Utah. His father started out as a journalist and later became a drive-time radio host, and Prince has memories of \"sitting around the dinner table, talking about the importance of the First Amendment and freedom of speech.\" As an undergraduate at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, Prince briefly considered majoring in computer science before deciding on English literature. He also founded a digital-only magazine. He went on to study law at the University of Chicago, where he attended those lectures by Professor Obama, before going to Harvard Business School, where he met Zatlyn.</p><p>Prince's eclectic background gave him the confidence to grapple with Cloudflare's speech dilemma at all its various layers: As a trained lawyer, he understood the legal implications of corporations policing speech acts; as the founder of a tech company, he was familiar with the technical abilities as well as business imperatives of dealing with customers; and as a liberal-arts-son-of-a-journalist, he thought a lot about what kind of rhetoric is acceptable online. Prince felt strongly that the invisible infrastructure layer of the internet, where Cloudflare operated, should not be the place to limit or adjudicate speech. In Prince's governing metaphor, it would be like AT&amp;T listening in on your phone conversations and saying, \"Hey, we don't like your political views. We're kicking you off our network.\"</p><p>In the years after the launch of Cloudflare, he argued, public-intellectual style, for the importance of preserving free speech online and the neutrality of the infrastructure layer of the internet. It was partly that history that allowed Prince and his colleagues to dismiss the initial investigation by the SPLC. \"We're always having controversies about things,\" Zatlyn says.</p><p>But Prince's law school certitude would soon be challenged by another, even uglier, twist involving the Daily Stormer. In the process of standing guard outside its clients' websites, Cloudflare's filters sometimes trap legitimate complaints against these sites, the majority of which involve copyright infringement. Someone uploads a catchy song to a website without permission from the artist. Eventually, the songwriter takes notice, but her lawyer can't present a cease-and-desist notice because the copyright violator is behind the Cloudflare shield. And so, over time, Cloudflare had developed a policy of passing along any complaint to its customers and letting them deal with the requests.</p><p>But a system designed to address copyright infringement proved to be less adept at dealing with Nazis. Ordinary people disturbed by the hate speech on the Daily Stormer would seek to register their complaints about the site to Cloudflare, the host. But instead of directly addressing the complaint, Cloudflare, following its usual policy, would pass those complaints, with the senders' contact information, along to the Daily Stormer.</p><p>In early May, another story came out-one that Cloudflare could not ignore. The article, by ProPublica, revealed that people who had complained to Cloudflare about the Daily Stormer were getting harassing and threatening calls and emails, including one that told the recipient to \"fuck off and die.\" The ProPublica piece quoted a blog post under Anglin's name: \"We need to make it clear to all of these people that there are consequences for messing with us. We are not a bunch of babies to be kicked around. We will take revenge. And we will do it now.\" It looked as if Cloudflare had ratted out decent people to an army of fascist trolls.</p><p>Recognizing that it had a legitimate problem on its hands that couldn't be erased by invoking free speech, Cloudflare quickly altered its abuse policy, giving users the option of not forwarding their identity and contact information. ProPublica also reported Anglin saying that the hate site paid $200 a month for its Cloudflare protection, a point Cloudflare would not comment on. Despite Cloudflare's pride in protecting any site, no matter how heinous, Prince says he was caught off guard by the Daily Stormer's attacks on the people who complained. \"What we didn't anticipate,\" Prince told me, ruefully, \"was that there are just truly awful human beings in the world.\"</p><p>\"EMPLOYEES WERE STRUGGLING. THERE ARE SOME REALLY AWFUL THINGS CURRENTLY ON THE WEB, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF US THAT THEY'RE UP THERE.\"</p><p>A few months later, on Friday, August 11, a group of torch-wielding white supremacists marched in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia; the next day a counterprotester named Heather Heyer was run over in what appeared to be an act of political violence. That afternoon, without mentioning Heyer's death, Donald Trump blamed the violence in Charlottesville on \"many sides,\" and the whole country was suddenly engulfed by the question of what we were willing to do to stand up to Nazis. The Daily Stormer posted a repulsive piece under Anglin's byline with the headline \"woman killed in road rage incident was a fat, childless 32-year-old slut.\" It only got worse from there.</p><p>After reading the post, an anti-fascist vigilante hacker known as the Jester tweeted, \"Nice site, Andrew. Be a shame if something 'happened' to it.\" But the threat was empty as long as Cloudflare continued to offer its protection. \"That night I was at home and I get this DM on Twitter from the Jester,\" Prince says. \"And he's saying, 'Hey, these guys are jerks. I want to DDoS them off the internet. Will you get out of the way?' \" Prince says he responded with a link to a speech he'd given at an internet security conference defending free speech principles. (The Jester did not respond to a request for comment.) Meanwhile, the wrath against Cloudflare was rising. \"All of a sudden, a ton of people were yelling at us on Twitter,\" Prince recalls. The online service GoDaddy, which maintained the Daily Stormer's domain, announced it was canceling this arrangement. The Daily Stormer tried to move its domain registration to Google Domains but was denied. Cloudflare seemed to be the last major player willing to do business with the neo-Nazi site, appearing once again to go out of its way to protect hate speech.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, Prince and his management team gathered to address the growing controversy. The backlash weighed heavily on the minds of the rank and file at Cloudflare. \"There was definitely water-cooler talk,\" recalls Janet Van Huysse, who oversees employees and human resources. \"We were all over the news. People were struggling. There were a lot of people who were like, 'I came to this company because I wanted to help build a better internet, and we believe fiercely in a free and open internet. But there are some really awful things currently on the web, and it's because of us that they're up there.' \" A range of feelings would emerge during a town-hall-style meeting for employees conducted later in the week. One attendee said to Prince, \"I don't have a good answer for what we should say going forward as a proud Cloudflare employee. What should I say?\" Another asked why they would consider kicking neo-Nazi sites off the platform, but not alleged ISIS sites.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Prince was hosting a dinner for Cloudflare interns at his home in San Francisco. At one point during the event, Cloudflare's general counsel, Doug Kramer, pulled Prince aside and said, \"It seems like this keeps ratcheting up.\" Checking his phone surreptitiously during the meal, Prince noticed that fellow technologist Paul Berry, founder and CEO of a social media service called RebelMouse, had taken to Twitter to denounce Cloudflare for hosting \"Nazi hate content that even @GoDaddy took down.\"</p><p>After the interns left his apartment, Prince and Tatiana Lingos-Webb, his fianc\u00e9e, cleaned up and did the dishes. (The two have since married.) Stung by Berry's tweet, Prince started bemoaning the ease with which people seemed willing to abandon the basic ideals of free speech. \"Maybe there is something different about Nazi content,\" Lingos-Webb ventured. \"And I looked at her and said, 'You too?' \" Prince recalls.</p><p>\"I went to bed angry,\" Prince says, \"and woke up in the morning still angry.\" Checking Twitter, he discovered that someone on the Daily Stormer site-in full frog-and-scorpion mode-had decided to antagonize the one service left supporting it. An anonymous comment about the site's technical challenges noted the moves by GoDaddy and Google to oust the Daily Stormer: \"They succeeded in everything except Cloudflare, whom I hear are secretly our /ourpeople/ at the upper echelons.\" Overnight, Prince and his colleagues had been welcomed into the ranks of practicing white supremacists.</p><p>Prince called Berry to walk through his reasoning for continuing to protect the Daily Stormer. Prince had known the RebelMouse CEO for years through the technology conference circuit and respected his opinions. It was a tense call. Berry told him he understood the predicament. \"But when you work that fucking hard to build something that's that successful, you get to choose who uses it,\" Berry recalls telling Prince. \"And you get to set a code of conduct that leaves it clear for people-a code of conduct that says we will not support white supremacy, racism, hate.\"</p><p>\"I'd try to make my argument,\" Prince says now of the conversation, \"and Paul would say, 'It doesn't matter, Nazis.' And I'd say, well, it kind of does, because if the phone company is listening in on my phone calls and then decides that they don't like what I'm talking about and starts pulling the plug, that seems creepy to me.\"</p><p>Hanging up with Berry, Prince got in the shower. He had barely slept; his friends seemed to be taking the wrong side of the free-speech argument. But he could see where the controversy was heading: If he kept protecting the Daily Stormer, the inevitable next step was a customer boycott of Cloudflare, with real business consequences. But if he kicked them off, \"I thought through the parade of horribles that would follow,\" he recalls. Suddenly every controversial site on the Cloudflare network would be subject for review, and Cloudflare would have helped establish a precedent for deep infrastructure services regulating speech. As he stood in the shower, all these thoughts swirled around his head. \"It was literally one of those lean-your-head-against-the-wall moments-like, what the hell are we going to do?\"</p><p>\"But then I had a thought: Maybe we can kick them off, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">then</emphasis> talk about why that's so dangerous. Maybe that can change the conversation.\" Prince would betray his principles and then make the betrayal into an argument for why those principles matter.</p><p>\"Matthew called me at around 10 that morning, and said, 'We're kicking them off,' \" Zatlyn recalls. She'd gone to bed feeling Cloudflare was not the right place to censor and assuming they would stick to the company policy. \"I was speechless, a little stunned. 'I'm surprised to hear you say this. I was not expecting that. But OK.' \"</p><p>By late morning, the company's trust and safety team had completed the procedures to remove the Daily Stormer from the Cloudflare network. And Prince drafted a blog post. It began in a just-the-facts mode: \"Earlier today, Cloudflare terminated the account of the Daily Stormer.\"</p><p>\"Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion.\" The tipping point for Prince was the suggestion on the Daily Stormer site that top managers at Cloudflare \"were secretly supporters of their ideology.\"</p><p>But then Prince took a rhetorical twist: \"Now, having made that decision, let me explain why it's so dangerous.\"</p><p>Prince spoke about the peril posed by DDoS attacks. We might all agree, Prince argued, that content like the Daily Stormer shouldn't be online, but the mechanism for silencing those voices should not be vigilante hackers.</p><p>His bigger argument was about the danger of private companies like Cloudflare (not to mention Google or Amazon Web Services) determining what constituted acceptable speech. \"Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation,\" Prince explained, \"a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.\" Perhaps his most striking point came in a separate memo he wrote to his staff. \"Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the internet. No one should have that power.\"</p><p>Prince's dilemma over the Daily Stormer has been present in net culture from the early days of online communities. But where debates about what forms of speech should be forbidden often seemed academic and remote, today they are at the center of social discourse. White-supremacist movements that once were deemed beyond the pale are more vocal, their ideas spreading openly into the mainstream, with political leaders not always willing to condemn them. Hankes, of the SPLC, says that even fringe hate sites \"can have a tremendous impact\" because of social media's ability to amplify extreme ideas. \"Our position has been that pretty much everyone south of the internet service providers\"-in other words, anyone hosting or protecting online content-\"has the responsibility to take a stance on these issues,\" Hankes says, \"or be ready to answer for the consequences of people who are taking advantage of their services.\"</p><p>The original free-speech ethos that shaped the internet has also grown shakier: Back then, strong First Amendment values were one of the few areas of agreement among the libertarians and progressives who shaped the early culture. Today, that alliance is less stable. Aggressive anti-hate-speech movements on college campuses have aroused ire among libertarians, and among progressives there is a growing sense that Big Tech has become a breeding ground for bile. Every other week, it seems, there's another flare-up over Twitter's terms of service and the rampant harassment and abuse that plagues that platform.</p><p>\"Honestly, I am so sad,\" Berry told me. \"I grew up in the Valley; I've been writing code since I was 10, and I believed in technology.\" But now, Berry says, he sees money to be made as a platform company triumphing over civic decency. \"Right now we have a tension between financial success and actually being human.\"</p><p>The immense size of those gatekeepers-like Google, Facebook, Twitter and, in its own way, Cloudflare-has also challenged the older vision of cyberspace as a realm of unchecked speech. There have been dark wells of hate online since the Usenet era, but back then, misanthropy was distributed across thousands of different platforms. Even if you felt some speech was objectionable enough to silence, it was a practical impossibility to get rid of it all. No single entity could silence an idea. But in a world where Facebook and Google count their audiences in the billions, a decision by one of those big players could, essentially, quiet an unpopular voice. In December, in fact, Twitter started enforcing new rules to suspend accounts of people who use multiple slurs or racist or sexist tropes in their profile information.</p><p>Prince is aware of that power, but he also carefully titrates the various elements in the internet concoction. He argues that there is a fundamental difference between sites like Facebook or Twitter, which provide content, and deep infrastructure like hosting or security services. For Prince, the relative invisibility of Cloudflare to ordinary consumers makes it the wrong place to address speech. \"I think that gives us a framework to say infrastructure isn't the right place to be regulating content,\" he says. \"Facebook and YouTube still may be-and it's an easier question for them, because they're advertising-supported companies. If you're Procter &amp; Gamble, you don't want your ad next to terrorist content, and so the business model and the policy line up.\"</p><p>If this sounds like passing the buck, Prince's argument does get philosophical support from civil liberties groups. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has taken a stand that what it calls \"intermediaries\"-services like Cloudflare and GoDaddy that do not generate the content themselves-should not be adjudicating what speech is acceptable. The EFF has a strong presumption that most speech, even vile speech, should be allowed, but when illegal activity, like inciting violence or defamation, occurs, the proper channel to deal with it is the legal system. \"It seems to me that the last thing we should be doing is having intermediaries deputizing themselves to make decisions about what's OK,\" says Corynne McSherry, legal director of the EFF. \"What law enforcement will tell you is that it's better for them to be able to keep track of potentially dangerous groups if they're not pushed down into the dark web.\" She adds: \"I want my Nazis where I can see them.\"</p><p>\"LITERALLY, I WOKE UP IN A BAD MOOD AND DECIDED SOMEONE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED ON THE INTERNET. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THAT POWER.\"</p><p>In the months following the Charlottesville weekend, the Daily Stormer bounced around a series of websites, briefly appearing on Russian and then Albanian domains with new URLs. Prince himself has grown more certain that his company should not be in the speech-regulation business. Since ejecting the Daily Stormer, Cloudflare has received more than 7,000 complaints about sites in its network. \"The weirdest was a totally nonpartisan cooking blog,\" Prince says. \"We've considered trying to make some of the recipes, to see if they're just really terrible.\" Though Prince's blog post vowed to establish a framework for managing objectionable sites on its network, little has changed. \"We're still having the debate, but I think the likely outcome is that as an infrastructure company, we're going to err on the side of being neutral and not do what we did to the Daily Stormer again,\" Prince says now.</p><p>Cloudflare can legitimately embrace free speech tradition in the defense of its policy. But it is also protecting its business interests. Network software and algorithms have allowed Big Tech to organize and distribute (and in Cloudflare's case, protect) staggering amounts of information. Looking for patterns in DDoS attacks, detecting the signatures of the Turkish Escort attackers-these are the kinds of problems that can be solved at scale with code. But evaluating 7,000 websites for, say, potential incitements to violence is not something that lends itself to a final determination by software alone; it invariably requires human judgment. Facebook and Google have confronted this issue in the past year with the infiltration of Russian ads and fake news into their feeds and screens. But humans are expensive. Only after public outcry did Facebook and YouTube pledge to hire thousands of human moderators to deal with suspicious ads and with videos that are inappropriate for children. Prince may be right that a service like Cloudflare's is the wrong place to make those assessments, but it's also convenient: Opting out of that obligation makes his business much easier to run.</p><p>One still-unresolved debate at Cloudflare is about how the company should memorialize the decision to eject the Daily Stormer. \"We do a transparency report twice a year, and one of the things that we have is a list of 'things we have never done.' \" It's a short list, and one of its key statements is, \"We have never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure.\" That is no longer true. \"So we're having this conversation now internally,\" Prince says, \"about whether we have to remove that.\"</p><p>As of December, Prince says, the company was leaning toward keeping the statement but adding an asterisk that links to a full account of the Daily Stormer affair. \"So when the next controversy comes along, we'll be able to point to that and say, 'This was the one time we did that, and here are the dangers it creates.' \" The Daily Stormer, however, has not been invited back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Johnson</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(@stevenbjohnson) is the author of 10 books, most recently</emphasis> Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World.</p><p>CUSTOM TYPEFACES BY <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COMMERCIAL TYPE</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_WI_0218_28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGB-H521-F13F-110C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 26</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The American political system right now may actually be a very good political system for making deals because you have a president who wants to negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that indicates a willingness to go to war.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A, but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the lawyers that there were no deals?  </p><p>      ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAY</emphasis>: Well it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You guys are busy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. It's been a very good year.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Your associates are fed. They're well fed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And they are working on Thanksgiving.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS</emphasis>: Well the lawyers are always busy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Do you know major -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas parties.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: That's what I know.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS</emphasis>: Has that changed since -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Why? Did you crash all of them?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big deals. There were Verizon we worked on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: A lot in the telecom.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China. This is an emotional issue as well.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Sure, and -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Set up a leadership path.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there are winners and losers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for corporations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line and -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. They've got to do better.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: - decided basically very little experience on that front.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial. And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking. Everybody says they're great.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U-turn or even veer off the [front].   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I agree you're going to do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got a lot of international experience or some international experience. So that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2 million employees.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's unreal how big it is.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to its different constituents.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the torch.   </p><p>      And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the international division to very standards.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock shareholder value as the parlance of the time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: More deals, more deals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: More deals for Bob Profusek.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No. The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis and recovery.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of diplomacy?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a massive learning curve.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the beginning as they try to figure out how things -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news here this morning. Help me, Nick.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question, he's had a really rough time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's been [rough].   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Throw that theory out the window.   </p><p>      06:17:03  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      06:23:41  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the present.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And it's always been there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS, some nice fund, -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: - you've got to -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long- term investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the money that you actually (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now, but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's supporting them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all these other forces. They're all for value today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day.     </p><p>      (BREAK)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington, but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Oh they're doing a lot of that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put together that are ten - they take a ten percent position.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: What?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of IBM or Walmart, do people -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: No, no, not if it's a passive investment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's invisible.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes, totally invisible.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in the country and not export the capital to the U.S.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business practices that you see in China?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired. You can't do that in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different. A year ago, -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial application, but what's the difference?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: They were more a national security concern.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Right, right, so of course.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating the political and regulatory waters.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes, absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: My question to you -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In China if somebody like him said something it would over.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what Japanese companies did in the late '80s?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now there's more state -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: So it's all going to end in tears.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money. And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries. Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it actually a freestanding company in China?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: It's - oh no, freestanding yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves. It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State- owned companies are state-owned companies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay, interesting.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: The state has a role.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well, Bob Profusek -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank. The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday.   </p><p>      A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the government to move forward.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card on Mr. Musk?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback. There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that gets us to travel across (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what would you -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of the room.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for 2014 for Elon Musk?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a) Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better and better. SpaceX will continue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: So you think it's overpriced then.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing him left and right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the greatest ideas.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right? He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And I did that theory.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: That's all so good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: But that's part of his whole -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: For the new era.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that he's put out in public.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Yes. And it seems genuine and real.   </p><p>      06:38:00  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      06:43:16  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't. Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in 2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the top.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part of what's causing this [crisis].   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really get their act together now that the crisis is over.     </p><p>      (BREAK)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it just right now that maybe -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not for Loeb in there agitating?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not really.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: So in this case maybe an activist was basically -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFUSEK</emphasis>: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're - there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's, again cacophony in the marketplace.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this beleaguered rollout?   </p><p>      And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product. This process is what people are going to remember.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have started sounding a lot more optimistic than before.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Okay.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: So maybe there's something we don't know.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How does it compare?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Okay, Kentucky and California.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: It's interesting, right, because -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What are they doing in Kentucky?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies, Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people there really focused on the technical aspects of health care.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more attention put on to it and they probably had good managers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: When is that? When is that on my calendar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Tom.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is it like March?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Next year.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: It's a year from now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: You brought up a great point about young people -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Then what's the incentive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: They'll possibly have the patience.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon].   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Right, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALESCI</emphasis>: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of this country?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that. Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends, and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all those trends might affect the other side of the equation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before November 30th.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMPSON</emphasis>: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Very good.  </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and  Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they  represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing  Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you  learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but  what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive  thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have  diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective.  We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we  saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The  American political system right now may actually be a very good political  system for making deals because you have a president who wants to  negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that  indicates a willingness to go to war. </p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A,  but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the  lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well  it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many  big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned - </p><p>KEENE: You guys are busy. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year. </p><p>KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving. </p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Well - </p><p>KEENE: Do you know major - </p><p>ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and  [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more. </p><p>KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas  parties. </p><p>ALESCI: Yes. </p><p>KEENE: That's what I know. </p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since - </p><p>ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them? </p><p>KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big  deals. There were Verizon we worked on. </p><p>FU: A lot in the telecom. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been  smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size. </p><p>KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China.  This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a  path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Sure, and - </p><p>KEENE: Set up a leadership path. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some  breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there  are winners and losers. </p><p>KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for  corporations?</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from  within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search. </p><p>ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line  and - </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better. </p><p>ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift  in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the  outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial.  And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour - </p><p>FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking.  Everybody says they're great. </p><p>KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be - </p><p>PROFUSEK: No. </p><p>KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search  going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I  suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic  move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a  different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front]. </p><p>KEENE: I agree you're going to do. </p><p>ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got  a lot of international experience or some international experience. So  that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more  of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front. </p><p>FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and  internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't  believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually  quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest  benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a  great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2  million employees. </p><p>KEENE: It's unreal how big it is. </p><p>FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of  course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to  its different constituents. </p><p>KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke  to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course  they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and  realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and  the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the  torch. </p><p>And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the  international division to very standards. </p><p>FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as  well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock  shareholder value as the parlance of the time. </p><p>ALESCI: More deals, more deals. </p><p>FU: More deals for Bob Profusek. </p><p>KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart  does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the  goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges. </p><p>ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that. </p><p>FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are  saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No.  The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any  Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did  get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis  and recovery. </p><p>KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have  written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if  you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your  foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of  diplomacy? </p><p>THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from  corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And  so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So  some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very  much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that  you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external  succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering  a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally. </p><p>KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a  massive learning curve. </p><p>THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where  people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the  beginning as they try to figure out how things - </p><p>KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news  here this morning. Help me, Nick. </p><p>THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has  no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very  successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he  certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question,  he's had a really rough time. </p><p>KEENE: It's been [rough]. </p><p>THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window. </p><p>06:17:03</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:23:41</p><p>KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new  activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday  with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're  looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the  present. </p><p>KEENE: And it's always been there. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s  before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was  a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today  is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS,  some nice fund, - </p><p>FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible). </p><p>PROFUSEK: - you've got to - </p><p>ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or - </p><p>PROFUSEK: No. </p><p>ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term  investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing  to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill  Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the  money that you actually (inaudible). </p><p>PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether  it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now,  but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash  right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to  invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money. </p><p>KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is  supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's  supporting them?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor  community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance  paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all  these other forces. They're all for value today. </p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a  couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as  we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For  a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security  issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington,  but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort  of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was  $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in  the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff. </p><p>KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more  shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of  companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that. </p><p>KEENE: Yes. </p><p>PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was  $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way  understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in  private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put  together that are ten - they take a ten percent position. </p><p>ALESCI: What?</p><p>KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of  IBM or Walmart, do people - </p><p>PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment. </p><p>KEENE: It's invisible. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible. </p><p>KEENE: Yes. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still  is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that. </p><p>ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done  because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in  the country and not export the capital to the U.S. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the  U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I  think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was  going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming. </p><p>KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in  China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business  practices that you see in China? </p><p>PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do  your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've  got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired.  You can't do that in this country. </p><p>FU: No. </p><p>PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government  relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a  Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different.  A year ago, - </p><p>FU: Yes. </p><p>PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this  situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial  application, but what's the difference? </p><p>FU: They were more a national security concern. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course. </p><p>FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating  the political and regulatory waters. </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>FU: My question to you - </p><p>PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is  that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I  don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and  doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In  China if somebody like him said something it would over. </p><p>FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different  between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what  Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now  there's more state - </p><p>FU: So it's all going to end in tears. </p><p>PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money.  And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries.  Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it - </p><p>KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our  viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is  it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it  actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes. </p><p>KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company. </p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves.  It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do. </p><p>KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding  company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned  companies are state-owned companies. </p><p>KEENE: Okay, interesting. </p><p>PROFUSEK: The state has a role. </p><p>FU: Well, Bob Profusek - </p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating. </p><p>FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to  also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the  scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less  than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was  halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank.  The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday. </p><p>A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo  mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a  communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and  all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the  government to move forward. </p><p>KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've  covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card  on Mr. Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of  indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after  success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback.  There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with  Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's  had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible). </p><p>KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for  Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted  innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism. </p><p>THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And  he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that  gets us to travel across (inaudible). </p><p>KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what  would you - </p><p>THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of  the room. </p><p>KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for  2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a)  Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more  inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better  and better. SpaceX will continue. </p><p>ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically  grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit. </p><p>THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying  it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy  here. </p><p>ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then. </p><p>THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams  built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think  we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his  current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and  eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them. </p><p>KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting  perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had. </p><p>FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing  him left and right. </p><p>ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the  greatest ideas. </p><p>KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most - </p><p>ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that. </p><p>THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right?  He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall  intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy. </p><p>FU: Yes. </p><p>KEENE: And I did that theory. </p><p>THOMPSON: That's all so good. </p><p>ALESCI: But that's part of his whole - </p><p>FU: For the new era. </p><p>ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that  he's put out in public. </p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real. </p><p>06:38:00</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:43:16</p><p>KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser  as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear  markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945. </p><p>THOMPSON: Right. </p><p>KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't.  Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p>THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many  cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to  break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that  makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in  2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did  actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the  top. </p><p>KEENE: Yes. </p><p>THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the  different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more  of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part  of what's causing this [crisis]. </p><p>KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really  get their act together now that the crisis is over. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob  Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in  terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a  company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push  around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going  to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the  entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it  just right now that maybe - </p><p>ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not  for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p>PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not  really. </p><p>ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically - </p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're -  there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's,  again cacophony in the marketplace. </p><p>FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out  certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here  because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the  healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts  over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully  functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this  beleaguered rollout? </p><p>And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing  Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the  deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and  Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a  work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that  the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The  problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product.  This process is what people are going to remember. </p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making  the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by  November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that  happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be  lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets  hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage  expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not  going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be  too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have  started sounding a lot more optimistic than before. </p><p>FU: Okay. </p><p>THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know. </p><p>FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with  say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know  you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How  does it compare?</p><p>THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a  deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably  better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't  have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and  such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then  they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers  reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission. </p><p>KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give  them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we  dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From  where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p>THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California. </p><p>KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart. </p><p>THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because - </p><p>KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky? </p><p>THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide  in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus  Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies,  Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be  the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up  the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people  there really focused on the technical aspects of health care. </p><p>KEENE: Right. </p><p>THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more  attention put on to it and they probably had good managers. </p><p>KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't  want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a  technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction  once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the  system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in  states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll  say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends. </p><p>KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p>ALESCI: Tom. </p><p>KEENE: Is it like March? </p><p>FU: Next year. </p><p>KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p>THOMPSON: It's a year from now. </p><p>ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people - </p><p>KEENE: Then what's the incentive. </p><p>ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues  may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary  numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what - </p><p>THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience. </p><p>ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible). </p><p>FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon]. </p><p>THOMPSON: Right, yes. </p><p>ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly  low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger  and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of  this country?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you  have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you  can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that.  Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get  health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends,  and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this  fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all  those trends might affect the other side of the equation. </p><p>FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before  November 30th. </p><p>THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or - </p><p>FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor. </p><p>THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start  working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see. </p><p>KEENE: Very good. </p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective. We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The American political system right now may actually be a very good political system for making deals because you have a president who wants to negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that indicates a willingness to go to war.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A, but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned -</p><p>KEENE: You guys are busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year.</p><p>KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well -</p><p>KEENE: Do you know major -</p><p>ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more.</p><p>KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas parties.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: That's what I know.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since -</p><p>ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them?</p><p>KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big deals. There were Verizon we worked on.</p><p>FU: A lot in the telecom.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size.</p><p>KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China. This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Sure, and -</p><p>KEENE: Set up a leadership path.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there are winners and losers.</p><p>KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for corporations?</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search.</p><p>ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line and -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better.</p><p>ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial. And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour -</p><p>FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking. Everybody says they're great.</p><p>KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front].</p><p>KEENE: I agree you're going to do.</p><p>ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got a lot of international experience or some international experience. So that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front.</p><p>FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2 million employees.</p><p>KEENE: It's unreal how big it is.</p><p>FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to its different constituents.</p><p>KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the torch.</p><p>And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the international division to very standards.</p><p>FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock shareholder value as the parlance of the time.</p><p>ALESCI: More deals, more deals.</p><p>FU: More deals for Bob Profusek.</p><p>KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges.</p><p>ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that.</p><p>FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No. The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis and recovery.</p><p>KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of diplomacy?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally.</p><p>KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a massive learning curve.</p><p>THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the beginning as they try to figure out how things -</p><p>KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news here this morning. Help me, Nick.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question, he's had a really rough time.</p><p>KEENE: It's been [rough].</p><p>THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window.</p><p>06:17:03</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:23:41</p><p>KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the present.</p><p>KEENE: And it's always been there.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS, some nice fund, -</p><p>FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: - you've got to -</p><p>ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the money that you actually (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now, but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money.</p><p>KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's supporting them?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all these other forces. They're all for value today.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington, but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff.</p><p>KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put together that are ten - they take a ten percent position.</p><p>ALESCI: What?</p><p>KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of IBM or Walmart, do people -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment.</p><p>KEENE: It's invisible.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that.</p><p>ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in the country and not export the capital to the U.S.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming.</p><p>KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business practices that you see in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired. You can't do that in this country.</p><p>FU: No.</p><p>PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different. A year ago, -</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial application, but what's the difference?</p><p>FU: They were more a national security concern.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course.</p><p>FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating the political and regulatory waters.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>FU: My question to you -</p><p>PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In China if somebody like him said something it would over.</p><p>FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now there's more state -</p><p>FU: So it's all going to end in tears.</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money. And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries. Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes.</p><p>KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves. It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do.</p><p>KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned companies are state-owned companies.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, interesting.</p><p>PROFUSEK: The state has a role.</p><p>FU: Well, Bob Profusek -</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating.</p><p>FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank. The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday.</p><p>A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the government to move forward.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card on Mr. Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback. There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism.</p><p>THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that gets us to travel across (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what would you -</p><p>THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of the room.</p><p>KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for 2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a) Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better and better. SpaceX will continue.</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit.</p><p>THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy here.</p><p>ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then.</p><p>THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them.</p><p>KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had.</p><p>FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing him left and right.</p><p>ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the greatest ideas.</p><p>KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most -</p><p>ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that.</p><p>THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right? He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: And I did that theory.</p><p>THOMPSON: That's all so good.</p><p>ALESCI: But that's part of his whole -</p><p>FU: For the new era.</p><p>ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that he's put out in public.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real.</p><p>06:38:00</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:43:16</p><p>KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945.</p><p>THOMPSON: Right.</p><p>KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't. Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p>THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in 2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the top.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part of what's causing this [crisis].</p><p>KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really get their act together now that the crisis is over.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it just right now that maybe -</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p>PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not really.</p><p>ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're - there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's, again cacophony in the marketplace.</p><p>FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this beleaguered rollout?</p><p>And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product. This process is what people are going to remember.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have started sounding a lot more optimistic than before.</p><p>FU: Okay.</p><p>THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know.</p><p>FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How does it compare?</p><p>THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission.</p><p>KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p>THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California.</p><p>KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because -</p><p>KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky?</p><p>THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies, Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people there really focused on the technical aspects of health care.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more attention put on to it and they probably had good managers.</p><p>KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends.</p><p>KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p>ALESCI: Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Is it like March?</p><p>FU: Next year.</p><p>KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p>THOMPSON: It's a year from now.</p><p>ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people -</p><p>KEENE: Then what's the incentive.</p><p>ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what -</p><p>THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible).</p><p>FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon].</p><p>THOMPSON: Right, yes.</p><p>ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of this country?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that. Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends, and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all those trends might affect the other side of the equation.</p><p>FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before November 30th.</p><p>THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or -</p><p>FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor.</p><p>THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see.</p><p>KEENE: Very good.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective. We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The American political system right now may actually be a very good political system for making deals because you have a president who wants to negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that indicates a willingness to go to war.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A, but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned -</p><p>KEENE: You guys are busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year.</p><p>KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well -</p><p>KEENE: Do you know major -</p><p>ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more.</p><p>KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas parties.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: That's what I know.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since -</p><p>ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them?</p><p>KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big deals. There were Verizon we worked on.</p><p>FU: A lot in the telecom.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size.</p><p>KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China. This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Sure, and -</p><p>KEENE: Set up a leadership path.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there are winners and losers.</p><p>KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for corporations?</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search.</p><p>ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line and -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better.</p><p>ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial. And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour -</p><p>FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking. Everybody says they're great.</p><p>KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front].</p><p>KEENE: I agree you're going to do.</p><p>ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got a lot of international experience or some international experience. So that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front.</p><p>FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2 million employees.</p><p>KEENE: It's unreal how big it is.</p><p>FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to its different constituents.</p><p>KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the torch.</p><p>And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the international division to very standards.</p><p>FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock shareholder value as the parlance of the time.</p><p>ALESCI: More deals, more deals.</p><p>FU: More deals for Bob Profusek.</p><p>KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges.</p><p>ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that.</p><p>FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No. The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis and recovery.</p><p>KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of diplomacy?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally.</p><p>KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a massive learning curve.</p><p>THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the beginning as they try to figure out how things -</p><p>KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news here this morning. Help me, Nick.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question, he's had a really rough time.</p><p>KEENE: It's been [rough].</p><p>THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window.</p><p>06:17:03</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:23:41</p><p>KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the present.</p><p>KEENE: And it's always been there.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS, some nice fund, -</p><p>FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: - you've got to -</p><p>ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the money that you actually (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now, but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money.</p><p>KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's supporting them?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all these other forces. They're all for value today.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington, but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff.</p><p>KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put together that are ten - they take a ten percent position.</p><p>ALESCI: What?</p><p>KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of IBM or Walmart, do people -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment.</p><p>KEENE: It's invisible.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that.</p><p>ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in the country and not export the capital to the U.S.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming.</p><p>KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business practices that you see in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired. You can't do that in this country.</p><p>FU: No.</p><p>PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different. A year ago, -</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial application, but what's the difference?</p><p>FU: They were more a national security concern.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course.</p><p>FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating the political and regulatory waters.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>FU: My question to you -</p><p>PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In China if somebody like him said something it would over.</p><p>FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now there's more state -</p><p>FU: So it's all going to end in tears.</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money. And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries. Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes.</p><p>KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves. It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do.</p><p>KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned companies are state-owned companies.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, interesting.</p><p>PROFUSEK: The state has a role.</p><p>FU: Well, Bob Profusek -</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating.</p><p>FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank. The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday.</p><p>A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the government to move forward.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card on Mr. Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback. There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism.</p><p>THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that gets us to travel across (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what would you -</p><p>THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of the room.</p><p>KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for 2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a) Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better and better. SpaceX will continue.</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit.</p><p>THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy here.</p><p>ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then.</p><p>THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them.</p><p>KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had.</p><p>FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing him left and right.</p><p>ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the greatest ideas.</p><p>KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most -</p><p>ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that.</p><p>THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right? He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: And I did that theory.</p><p>THOMPSON: That's all so good.</p><p>ALESCI: But that's part of his whole -</p><p>FU: For the new era.</p><p>ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that he's put out in public.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real.</p><p>06:38:00</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:43:16</p><p>KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945.</p><p>THOMPSON: Right.</p><p>KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't. Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p>THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in 2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the top.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part of what's causing this [crisis].</p><p>KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really get their act together now that the crisis is over.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it just right now that maybe -</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p>PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not really.</p><p>ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're - there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's, again cacophony in the marketplace.</p><p>FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this beleaguered rollout?</p><p>And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product. This process is what people are going to remember.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have started sounding a lot more optimistic than before.</p><p>FU: Okay.</p><p>THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know.</p><p>FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How does it compare?</p><p>THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission.</p><p>KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p>THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California.</p><p>KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because -</p><p>KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky?</p><p>THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies, Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people there really focused on the technical aspects of health care.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more attention put on to it and they probably had good managers.</p><p>KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends.</p><p>KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p>ALESCI: Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Is it like March?</p><p>FU: Next year.</p><p>KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p>THOMPSON: It's a year from now.</p><p>ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people -</p><p>KEENE: Then what's the incentive.</p><p>ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what -</p><p>THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible).</p><p>FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon].</p><p>THOMPSON: Right, yes.</p><p>ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of this country?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that. Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends, and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all those trends might affect the other side of the equation.</p><p>FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before November 30th.</p><p>THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or -</p><p>FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor.</p><p>THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see.</p><p>KEENE: Very good.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective. We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The American political system right now may actually be a very good political system for making deals because you have a president who wants to negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that indicates a willingness to go to war.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A, but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned -</p><p>KEENE: You guys are busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year.</p><p>KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well -</p><p>KEENE: Do you know major -</p><p>ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more.</p><p>KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas parties.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: That's what I know.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since -</p><p>ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them?</p><p>KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big deals. There were Verizon we worked on.</p><p>FU: A lot in the telecom.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size.</p><p>KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China. This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Sure, and -</p><p>KEENE: Set up a leadership path.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there are winners and losers.</p><p>KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for corporations?</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search.</p><p>ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line and -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better.</p><p>ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial. And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour -</p><p>FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking. Everybody says they're great.</p><p>KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front].</p><p>KEENE: I agree you're going to do.</p><p>ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got a lot of international experience or some international experience. So that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front.</p><p>FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2 million employees.</p><p>KEENE: It's unreal how big it is.</p><p>FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to its different constituents.</p><p>KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the torch.</p><p>And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the international division to very standards.</p><p>FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock shareholder value as the parlance of the time.</p><p>ALESCI: More deals, more deals.</p><p>FU: More deals for Bob Profusek.</p><p>KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges.</p><p>ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that.</p><p>FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No. The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis and recovery.</p><p>KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of diplomacy?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally.</p><p>KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a massive learning curve.</p><p>THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the beginning as they try to figure out how things -</p><p>KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news here this morning. Help me, Nick.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question, he's had a really rough time.</p><p>KEENE: It's been [rough].</p><p>THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window.</p><p>06:17:03</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:23:41</p><p>KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the present.</p><p>KEENE: And it's always been there.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS, some nice fund, -</p><p>FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: - you've got to -</p><p>ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p>ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the money that you actually (inaudible).</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now, but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money.</p><p>KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's supporting them?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all these other forces. They're all for value today.</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington, but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff.</p><p>KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put together that are ten - they take a ten percent position.</p><p>ALESCI: What?</p><p>KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of IBM or Walmart, do people -</p><p>PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment.</p><p>KEENE: It's invisible.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that.</p><p>ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in the country and not export the capital to the U.S.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming.</p><p>KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business practices that you see in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired. You can't do that in this country.</p><p>FU: No.</p><p>PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different. A year ago, -</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial application, but what's the difference?</p><p>FU: They were more a national security concern.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course.</p><p>FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating the political and regulatory waters.</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>FU: My question to you -</p><p>PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In China if somebody like him said something it would over.</p><p>FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now there's more state -</p><p>FU: So it's all going to end in tears.</p><p>PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money. And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries. Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes.</p><p>KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company.</p><p>PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves. It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do.</p><p>KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p>PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned companies are state-owned companies.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, interesting.</p><p>PROFUSEK: The state has a role.</p><p>FU: Well, Bob Profusek -</p><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating.</p><p>FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank. The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday.</p><p>A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the government to move forward.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card on Mr. Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback. There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism.</p><p>THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that gets us to travel across (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what would you -</p><p>THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of the room.</p><p>KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for 2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p>THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a) Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better and better. SpaceX will continue.</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit.</p><p>THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy here.</p><p>ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then.</p><p>THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them.</p><p>KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had.</p><p>FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing him left and right.</p><p>ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the greatest ideas.</p><p>KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most -</p><p>ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that.</p><p>THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right? He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: And I did that theory.</p><p>THOMPSON: That's all so good.</p><p>ALESCI: But that's part of his whole -</p><p>FU: For the new era.</p><p>ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that he's put out in public.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real.</p><p>06:38:00</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:43:16</p><p>KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945.</p><p>THOMPSON: Right.</p><p>KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't. Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p>THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in 2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the top.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part of what's causing this [crisis].</p><p>KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really get their act together now that the crisis is over.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it just right now that maybe -</p><p>ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p>PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not really.</p><p>ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically -</p><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're - there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's, again cacophony in the marketplace.</p><p>FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this beleaguered rollout?</p><p>And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product. This process is what people are going to remember.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have started sounding a lot more optimistic than before.</p><p>FU: Okay.</p><p>THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know.</p><p>FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How does it compare?</p><p>THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission.</p><p>KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p>THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California.</p><p>KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart.</p><p>THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because -</p><p>KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky?</p><p>THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies, Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people there really focused on the technical aspects of health care.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more attention put on to it and they probably had good managers.</p><p>KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p>THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends.</p><p>KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p>ALESCI: Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Is it like March?</p><p>FU: Next year.</p><p>KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p>THOMPSON: It's a year from now.</p><p>ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people -</p><p>KEENE: Then what's the incentive.</p><p>ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what -</p><p>THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible).</p><p>FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon].</p><p>THOMPSON: Right, yes.</p><p>ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of this country?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that. Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends, and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all those trends might affect the other side of the equation.</p><p>FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before November 30th.</p><p>THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or -</p><p>FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor.</p><p>THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see.</p><p>KEENE: Very good.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and  Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they  represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing  Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you  learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but  what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p> NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive  thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have  diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective.  We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we  saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The  American political system right now may actually be a very good political  system for making deals because you have a president who wants to  negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that  indicates a willingness to go to war. </p><p> KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A,  but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the  lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p> ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well  it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many  big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned - </p><p> KEENE: You guys are busy. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year. </p><p> KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving. </p><p> CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Well - </p><p> KEENE: Do you know major - </p><p> ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and  [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more. </p><p> KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas  parties. </p><p> ALESCI: Yes. </p><p> KEENE: That's what I know. </p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since - </p><p> ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them? </p><p> KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big  deals. There were Verizon we worked on. </p><p> FU: A lot in the telecom. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been  smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size. </p><p> KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China.  This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a  path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Sure, and - </p><p> KEENE: Set up a leadership path. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some  breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there  are winners and losers. </p><p> KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for  corporations?</p><p> PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from  within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search. </p><p> ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line  and - </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better. </p><p> ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift  in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the  outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial.  And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour - </p><p> FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking.  Everybody says they're great. </p><p> KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be - </p><p> PROFUSEK: No. </p><p> KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search  going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I  suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic  move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a  different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front]. </p><p> KEENE: I agree you're going to do. </p><p> ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got  a lot of international experience or some international experience. So  that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more  of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front. </p><p> FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and  internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't  believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually  quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest  benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a  great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2  million employees. </p><p> KEENE: It's unreal how big it is. </p><p> FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of  course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to  its different constituents. </p><p> KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke  to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course  they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and  realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and  the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the  torch. </p><p> And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the  international division to very standards. </p><p> FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as  well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock  shareholder value as the parlance of the time. </p><p> ALESCI: More deals, more deals. </p><p> FU: More deals for Bob Profusek. </p><p> KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart  does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the  goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges. </p><p> ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that. </p><p> FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are  saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No.  The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any  Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did  get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis  and recovery. </p><p> KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have  written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if  you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your  foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of  diplomacy? </p><p> THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from  corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And  so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So  some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very  much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that  you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external  succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering  a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally. </p><p> KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a  massive learning curve. </p><p> THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where  people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the  beginning as they try to figure out how things - </p><p> KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news  here this morning. Help me, Nick. </p><p> THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has  no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very  successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he  certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question,  he's had a really rough time. </p><p> KEENE: It's been [rough]. </p><p> THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window. </p><p> 06:17:03</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 06:23:41</p><p> KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new  activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday  with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're  looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the  present. </p><p> KEENE: And it's always been there. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s  before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was  a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today  is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS,  some nice fund, - </p><p> FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible). </p><p> PROFUSEK: - you've got to - </p><p> ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or - </p><p> PROFUSEK: No. </p><p> ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term  investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing  to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill  Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the  money that you actually (inaudible). </p><p> PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether  it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now,  but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash  right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to  invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money. </p><p> KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is  supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's  supporting them?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor  community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance  paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all  these other forces. They're all for value today. </p><p> KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a  couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as  we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For  a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security  issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington,  but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort  of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was  $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in  the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff. </p><p> KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more  shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of  companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that. </p><p> KEENE: Yes. </p><p> PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was  $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way  understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in  private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put  together that are ten - they take a ten percent position. </p><p> ALESCI: What?</p><p> KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of  IBM or Walmart, do people - </p><p> PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment. </p><p> KEENE: It's invisible. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible. </p><p> KEENE: Yes. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still  is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that. </p><p> ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done  because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in  the country and not export the capital to the U.S.</p><p> PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the  U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I  think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was  going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming. </p><p> KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in  China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business  practices that you see in China? </p><p> PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do  your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've  got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired.  You can't do that in this country. </p><p> FU: No. </p><p> PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government  relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a  Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different.  A year ago, - </p><p> FU: Yes. </p><p> PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this  situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial  application, but what's the difference? </p><p> FU: They were more a national security concern. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course. </p><p> FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating  the political and regulatory waters. </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely. </p><p> FU: My question to you - </p><p> PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is  that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I  don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and  doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In  China if somebody like him said something it would over. </p><p> FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different  between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what  Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p> PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now  there's more state - </p><p> FU: So it's all going to end in tears. </p><p> PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money.  And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries.  Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it - </p><p> KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our  viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is  it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it  actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p> PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes. </p><p> KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company. </p><p> PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves.  It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do. </p><p> KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding  company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p> PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned  companies are state-owned companies. </p><p> KEENE: Okay, interesting. </p><p> PROFUSEK: The state has a role. </p><p> FU: Well, Bob Profusek - </p><p> KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating. </p><p> FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to  also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the  scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less  than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was  halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank.  The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday. </p><p> A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo  mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a  communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and  all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the  government to move forward. </p><p> KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've  covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card  on Mr. Musk?</p><p> THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of  indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after  success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback.  There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with  Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's  had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible). </p><p> KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for  Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted  innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism. </p><p> THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And  he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that  gets us to travel across (inaudible). </p><p> KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what  would you - </p><p> THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of  the room. </p><p> KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for  2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p> THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a)  Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more  inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better  and better. SpaceX will continue. </p><p> ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically  grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit. </p><p> THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying  it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy  here. </p><p> ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then. </p><p> THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams  built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think  we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his  current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and  eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them. </p><p> KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting  perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had. </p><p> FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing  him left and right. </p><p> ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the  greatest ideas. </p><p> KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most - </p><p> ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that. </p><p> THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right?  He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall  intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy. </p><p> FU: Yes. </p><p> KEENE: And I did that theory. </p><p> THOMPSON: That's all so good. </p><p> ALESCI: But that's part of his whole - </p><p> FU: For the new era. </p><p> ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that  he's put out in public. </p><p> THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real. </p><p> 06:38:00</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 06:43:16</p><p> KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser  as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear  markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945. </p><p> THOMPSON: Right. </p><p> KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't.  Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p> THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many  cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to  break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that  makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in  2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did  actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the  top. </p><p> KEENE: Yes. </p><p> THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the  different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more  of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part  of what's causing this [crisis]. </p><p> KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really  get their act together now that the crisis is over. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob  Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in  terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p> PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a  company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push  around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going  to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the  entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it  just right now that maybe - </p><p> ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not  for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p> PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not  really. </p><p> ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically - </p><p> PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're -  there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's,  again cacophony in the marketplace. </p><p> FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out  certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here  because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the  healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts  over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully  functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this  beleaguered rollout? </p><p> And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing  Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the  deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and  Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a  work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that  the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The  problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product.  This process is what people are going to remember. </p><p> THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making  the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by  November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that  happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be  lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets  hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage  expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not  going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be  too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have  started sounding a lot more optimistic than before. </p><p> FU: Okay. </p><p> THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know. </p><p> FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with  say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know  you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How  does it compare?</p><p> THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a  deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably  better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't  have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and  such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then  they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers  reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission. </p><p> KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give  them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we  dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From  where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p> THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California. </p><p> KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart. </p><p> THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because - </p><p> KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky? </p><p> THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide  in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus  Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies,  Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be  the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up  the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people  there really focused on the technical aspects of health care. </p><p> KEENE: Right. </p><p> THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more  attention put on to it and they probably had good managers. </p><p> KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't  want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p> THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a  technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction  once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the  system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in  states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll  say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends. </p><p> KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p> ALESCI: Tom. </p><p> KEENE: Is it like March? </p><p> FU: Next year. </p><p> KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p> THOMPSON: It's a year from now. </p><p> ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people - </p><p> KEENE: Then what's the incentive. </p><p> ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues  may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary  numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what - </p><p> THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience. </p><p> ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible). </p><p> FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon]. </p><p> THOMPSON: Right, yes. </p><p> ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly  low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger  and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of  this country?</p><p> THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you  have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you  can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that.  Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get  health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends,  and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this  fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all  those trends might affect the other side of the equation. </p><p> FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before  November 30th. </p><p> THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or - </p><p> FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor. </p><p> THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start  working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see. </p><p> KEENE: Very good. </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p/><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Robert Profusek is Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. He is a partner at Jones Day, a global law firm. And they represent 502 of the Fortune 500. Nick Thompson is Bloomberg Contributing Editor and with The New Yorker Magazine as well. Nick, what have you learned about Iran? I think The New Yorker has done great work on this, but what is distinctive that we need to know since our Saturday evening?</p><p/><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The most distinctive thing to know is that we actually finally have a deal that we have diplomacy that seems to be working because sanctions were so effective. We're seen that putting strong pressure and then having negotiations, as we saw in Syria, now as we see in Iran, turns out to be a good mix. The American political system right now may actually be a very good political system for making deals because you have a president who wants to negotiate, and you have a Congress and you also have a history that indicates a willingness to go to war.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, we're going to talk about China here in a bit on M&amp;A, but let's talk about the basic idea of 2013. What happened? Do we blame the lawyers that there were no deals?</p><p/><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JONES DAY: Well it depends on how you look at it. There were plenty of deals, not that many big mega deals, but some. There you mentioned -</p><p/><p>KEENE: You guys are busy.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. It's been a very good year.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Your associates are fed. They're well fed.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And they are working on Thanksgiving.</p><p/><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well the lawyers are always busy.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Do you know major -</p><p/><p>ALESCI: The lawyers are always busy. The lawyers are doing the work and [they said] the bankers are the ones that want more, more, more, more.</p><p/><p>KEENE: I totally agree with you. Major law firms have like eight Christmas parties.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p/><p>KEENE: That's what I know.</p><p/><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Has that changed since -</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Why? Did you crash all of them?</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's just the way it is. But you guys have been busy, right?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. We've been busy because it's been - there have been some big deals. There were Verizon we worked on.</p><p/><p>FU: A lot in the telecom.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And Tokyo Electron. We're doing plenty of them, but they've been smaller. They've been sort of beneath the front page headlines size.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Well we've got a lot to talk about this hour, particularly on China. This is an emotional issue as well.</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>KEENE: Let's bring in Robert Profusek from Jones Day. Leadership is about a path, isn't it? This is one of the toughest things for companies to do.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Sure, and -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Set up a leadership path.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And it can - and it's very difficult. And sometimes there's some breakage, as it was mentioned that when you set up an internal system there are winners and losers.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Is there a best practice here that you see each and every day for corporations?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: There's no question that the best practice is to hire from within. You know what you're getting when you go through external search.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Hire from within even though they've got to do better on the line and -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. They've got to do better.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: - decided basically very little experience on that front.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And that's an important point. When you got to make a shift in direction maybe there's a good argument for getting somebody from the outside, but the search process is inherently to some degree superficial. And I'm on a lot of, a couple of boards. You have a two hour -</p><p/><p>FU: It's to make sure that you don't miss anything.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. You have a two-hour interview. You do all the checking. Everybody says they're great.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Are you representing Microsoft at this time? I just want to be -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Okay. You're not representing Microsoft. There's the ultimate search going on right now. You say you need an internal candidate, but that I suggest would be a different story with Alan Mulally front and center.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well when you've got to make - when you need to make a strategic move that argues, as was just mentioned for maybe taking somebody with a different perspective. I'm not sure Walmart needs to make some sort of U- turn or even veer off the [front].</p><p/><p>KEENE: I agree you're going to do.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Well one major question is the fact that McMillon has actually got a lot of international experience or some international experience. So that's raised some questions about whether or not there's going to be more of a focus given the fact that they really fumbled the ball on that front.</p><p/><p>FU: Well there is some talk that perhaps he will focus more and internationally. David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott says he doesn't believe that he'll ignore the United States because the U.S. has actually quite well under Bill Simon. Actually David Strasser says that the biggest benefit that McMillon brings with him, his best strength, is that he's a great communicator. And that's important because this is a company with 2.2 million employees.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's unreal how big it is.</p><p/><p>FU: They do business with so many vendors, with so many countries. And of course the investment community that is the Walmart CEO's job to speak to its different constituents.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Let me bring in Michael Eckstein's quote from Credit Suisse. I spoke to him yesterday. They're terrific analysts on big box retail. Of course they go into that crucial season. We view McMillon as pragmatic and realistic. We think he will continue the legacy of focus on compliance and the core values of the company. And the idea is just simply passing the torch.</p><p/><p>And here's more on it. We do believe that he will continue to hold the international division to very standards.</p><p/><p>FU: He also suggested there might be possible divestitures from Walmart as well, which a lot of people have called for as a way to further unlock shareholder value as the parlance of the time.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: More deals, more deals.</p><p/><p>FU: More deals for Bob Profusek.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's going to be fascinating, just fascinating to see what Walmart does here. Again I go back to share price and that Mr. Duke delivered the goods, whatever the case with nominal GDP and domestic challenges.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: He did, so certainly played a [credit] for that.</p><p/><p>FU: Yes. So Bill Simon did do quite a bit. And Mike Duke also people are saying there's a lot of question marks over whether he was pushed out. No. The guy was getting ready to retire. Sure he had the shortest tenure of any Walmart CEO, but he did do more than just hold the ship together. He did get Walmart through a very tough period going through the financial crisis and recovery.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right, Nick Thompson with us as well from The New Yorker. You have written definitely on your grandfather, Paul Nitze, and the game theory if you will of war. What can leadership in corporations learn from your foreign affairs world? What can they learn from the complexity of diplomacy?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Well the complexity of diplomacy is quite different from corporations because you're switching out the players every four years. And so you have a very limited time frame in which you have to negotiate. So some of the ways are different, but I think you do - you do have to very much plan for worst case scenarios. I think that's actually one thing that you can learn when you're planning an internal succession versus external succession. If you bring in from somebody from the outside you're entering a more high-risk environment than if you bring internally.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And that learning curve, which is - anybody from the outside has a massive learning curve.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Massive learning curve, which you actually see in politics where people come in and they tend to make a whole lot of mistakes in the beginning as they try to figure out how things -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Is the president still in the learning curve? I got make some news here this morning. Help me, Nick.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: It's funny. The president, he came in and everybody said he has no experience and it's going to be very hard. And then he was very successful, at least legislatively the first couple years. Now that he certainly knows how to be president, there's not an experience question, he's had a really rough time.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's been [rough].</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Throw that theory out the window.</p><p/><p>06:17:03</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>06:23:41</p><p/><p>KEENE: Robert Profusek with us with Jones Day. Bob, you look at the new activism. Bill Ackman was in our offices supporting a charity yesterday with our Erik Schatzker. Is Bill Ackman good for the market?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well it depends on what length of period here, Tom, you're looking at. Part of activism is just is to accelerate the future to the present.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And it's always been there.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And it's always been there. We called them back in the '80s before you were probably out of high school we called them raiders. It was a different word, but activism has been there. What's different about today is there's a huge amount of capital committed to it. If you're a CalPERS, some nice fund, -</p><p/><p>FU: Yes. The fund simply management (inaudible).</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: - you've got to -</p><p/><p>ALESCI: But this isn't just about corporate raiders or -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: No.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: - what you would call corporate raiders. This is long-term investors that are pressing for change. These are people who have nothing to do with the corporate raiders. They're actually supporting the Bill Ackman's and the Icahn's of the world behind the scenes. And here's the money that you actually (inaudible).</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well what they're - what they're saying is go back to whether it's good for employees then. What that means is cut back on your R&amp;D now, but this is a message in Wall Street generally, which is I need more cash right now because I'm in this lower yield environment, don't want to invest. Don't do R&amp;D. Don't buy that little thing. Give me the money.</p><p/><p>KEENE: I critically look at the time frame of the activist. Who is supporting them besides themselves? It's almost a narcissistic event. Who's supporting them?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well there's plenty of support in the institutional investor community. There's - it's with the shift in the corporate governance paradigm in general. You've got something called the ISS. We've got all these other forces. They're all for value today.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek with us with Jones Day.</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>KEENE: Bob, it's front and center here. There was a [Unical] blowup a couple years ago back and forth with Canada and such. Is there a new-new as we go into 2014 with Chinese acquisition of our assets?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. I think it's - Smithfield was important psychologically. For a little bit everybody said, okay, maybe this is a national security issues, something called Cfius is the way it operates down in Washington, but Smithfield made sausage, and bacon and stuff like that. And it was sort of hard to argue it was a national security item, but it was big. It was $2.8 billion. And that was a little bit of a breakthrough, especially in the mind of the Chinese businessperson, saying that we can do this stuff.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Is the distinction here a majority ownership, or are they more shrewd to take modest minority ownerships across a broad swath of companies, almost like a sovereign wealth fund?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Oh they're doing a lot of that.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: When the - as of September 30 they had the [poor] side there was $12 billion of investment from China into the U.S. this year. That's way understated because what it doesn't include is things like investments in private equity firms, investments in deals that private equity firms put together that are ten - they take a ten percent position.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: What?</p><p/><p>KEENE: Are they visible under five percent? If they buy three percent of IBM or Walmart, do people -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: No, no, not if it's a passive investment.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's invisible.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, totally invisible.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And I would suggest to you that $12 billion number, which still is really big that five years ago it was $300 million, something like that.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: What's the biggest challenge to actually getting a deal done because we know that the government would rather see the investment stay in the country and not export the capital to the U.S.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Actually the Chinese are trying to export their capital to the U.S. One of the things, law firms like mine we rushed over to China, and I think most professional services firms on the assumption that capital was going to China. That was totally wrong. It's coming.</p><p/><p>KEENE: What have you learned in the last 24 months with Jones Day's work in China? What is the message you would have to Americans about business practices that you see in China?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: It's well capital is coming the other way, and you've got to do your homework. You can't just come here and say we like to do this. You've got to - it's got to do prep work. The Smithfield deal was not prewired. You can't do that in this country.</p><p/><p>FU: No.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: But it was preplanned, pre thought out, both IR, government relations, everything else. And you can get it done. Now if you're - if a Chinese company is trying to buy a big tech company it gets all different. A year ago, -</p><p/><p>FU: Yes.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: - I don't know if you remember this Hawker Beechcraft, this situation made - they made airplanes. Now they're for commercial application, but what's the difference?</p><p/><p>FU: They were more a national security concern.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Right, right, so of course.</p><p/><p>FU: But the Chinese companies have gotten a lot more adept in navigating the political and regulatory waters.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes, absolutely.</p><p/><p>FU: My question to you -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: But the one thing that still is a little difficult in China is that the U.S. is a cacophonous place. And when Senator Schumer says, I don't like this, the Chinese businessperson says, wait a minute, and doesn't realize that that's just the way it is here that where we talk. In China if somebody like him said something it would over.</p><p/><p>FU: Different, and different environment certainly. What's different between Chinese companies coming in and buying U.S. companies versus what Japanese companies did in the late '80s?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: I - and from my point of view there is no difference really. Now there's more state -</p><p/><p>FU: So it's all going to end in tears.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: There's more state - I don't think so. There's more state money. And well one thing is don't forget China is sitting on a ton of treasuries. Would you rather be in treasuries or start putting and some of it -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Okay. I'll go with that incentive, but I think the core issue of our viewers and listeners across America is who is investing in Smithfield? Is it a direct conduit from Beijing and the federal government? Or is it actually a freestanding company in China?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: It's - oh no, freestanding yes.</p><p/><p>KEENE: You buy the idea it's a freestanding company.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And it's a freestanding company, but let's not kid ourselves. It's a controlled economy. Someone has to say that's an okay thing to do.</p><p/><p>KEENE: You don't think Beijing is rubberstamping some freestanding company's purchase of a pork maker and a sausage maker in America?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: I think they're looking at it before it's done. State-owned companies are state-owned companies.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Okay, interesting.</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: The state has a role.</p><p/><p>FU: Well, Bob Profusek -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Bob Profusek, fascinating, fascinating.</p><p/><p>FU: Yes. Stay with us. We're going to have more on this, but we want to also pivot to another topic here. Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the scheduled launch of its Falcon 9 spacecraft last night. The rocket was less than four minutes from liftoff at Cape Canaveral when the countdown was halted. Musk says there was a problem with the Falcon's liquid oxygen tank. The launch has been rescheduled for Thursday.</p><p/><p>A little more than a year ago SpaceX completed the first regular cargo mission in commercial space flight. This mission will carry a communications satellite into orbit. So SpaceX couldn't get it done, and all this talk about how private companies are in a better position than the government to move forward.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right. Nick Thompson, Elon Musk has been a huge 2013 story. You've covered this. You've pondered it. You looked at it. What's your report card on Mr. Musk?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: And this is actually this stutter in the launch is sort of indicative of his year. He's an extraordinary year of success after success, but every time there's a string of success there's some setback. There's a fire at a Tesla factory. There's something that goes wrong with Tesla. There's something that goes wrong with SpaceX, but basically he's had the most interesting, most successful year (inaudible).</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's amazing to see. And I've been a critic at times in writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, but the fact is this guy has jumpstarted innovation. He seems to be impervious to criticism.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: He's impervious to criticism. He's jumpstarting innovation. And he hasn't stopped dreaming big. He's going to build us a hyper loop that gets us to travel across (inaudible).</p><p/><p>KEENE: Well that's what he says he's going to do, but what do you - what would you -</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Would you believe that of anybody else? No. You'd laugh it out of the room.</p><p/><p>KEENE: What is your - what - that's true. What is your prescription for 2014 for Elon Musk?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: For Elon Musk he's probably going to start - we'll find (a) Tesla. Ideally for him Tesla will actually really start to make more inroads. We'll have a string of success, buy more and more cars and better and better. SpaceX will continue.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Do you think that it will grow into its tough Tesla specifically grow into its valuation, because we've seen the stock come up quite a bit.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it can grow into its valuation. I was just saying it should grow massively, not grow into its valuation. Let's not talk crazy here.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: So you think it's overpriced then.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Well Tesla there's a lot of promise. There are a lot of dreams built into Tesla, but there's also been a lot of success at Tesla. I think we'll see with Elon Musk the question is whether he'll get Ford to buy his current companies and he'll end up starting a fourth or fifth, and eventually whether those deals start to have an effect on them.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Well Nick Thompson with us from The New Yorker, some interesting perspect - I'm fascinated by the year Mr. Musk has had.</p><p/><p>FU: Yes. He's on the covers of all these different magazines. I'm seeing him left and right.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: He's just like an interesting guy, right? He's a - he has the greatest ideas.</p><p/><p>KEENE: What's the Dos Equis, he's had the world's most -</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Most interesting man. I don't know if you can use him for that.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: So weird, and there are so many bizarre things about him, right? He's a man who has lots of children because he wants to improve the overall intelligence of the human race he said. He's a quirky guy.</p><p/><p>FU: Yes.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And I did that theory.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: That's all so good.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: But that's part of his whole -</p><p/><p>FU: For the new era.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Like that's just part of his whole character. It's the one that he's put out in public.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And it seems genuine and real.</p><p/><p>06:38:00</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>06:43:16</p><p/><p>KEENE: Nicholas Thompson with us with The New Yorker and Bloomberg adviser as well. Nick, this speaks so much of that phrase Eurosclerosis. We clear markets. We go back to Friedrich Hayek, 1945.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Right.</p><p/><p>KEENE: We do it. We clear markets. It's ugly, but we do it and they don't. Do you see any hope that Europe can become more malleable, more supple?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: You would actually you would hope so, but and there are so many cultural differences. There are language differences. They've tried to break us down. We've a pretty sclerotic political system right now that makes it hard to act. You saw that in our response to what happened in 2008. We responded very slowly, responded inefficiently, but we did actually respond. And that's a large reason why that chart heads up in the top.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Europe has a much, much, much tougher time, but it's also the different kinds of responses. We chose more of a stimulus. They chose more of an austerity. A lot of people would make the argument that that's part of what's causing this [crisis].</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yes. It's a huge question I think for next year, can Europe really get their act together now that the crisis is over.</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>ALESCI: But I'm curious to get our guest host's opinion on this, Bob Profusek from Jones Day. What do you think went wrong or right at Sony in terms of the way Dan Loeb handled it?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Well I'd say Dan Loeb handled it about the best you can with a company like Sony. There was no question that he wasn't going to push around the company. This isn't some U.S. company where the boards are going to get weak kneed. And they didn't do what he said, which is separate the entertainment business, but the company's doing something, talking about it just right now that maybe -</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Do you think the company would have done something if it were not for Loeb in there agitating?</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: And that's the question. And I guess my guess would be not really.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: So in this case maybe an activist was basically -</p><p/><p>PROFUSEK: Yes. And Japan's different. Companies are different. They're - there's the interlocking ownership and it's not like it is here where it's, again cacophony in the marketplace.</p><p/><p>FU: Well we'll continue to monitor this one because it will play out certainly in the next couple of months. We want to switch topics here because the president's deadline of November 30th is to fix the healthcare.gov website is fast approaching. There are also fresh doubts over whether the site, which has been dogged by glitches will be fully functional by then. Can the Obama Administration take another hit from this beleaguered rollout?</p><p/><p>And joining us now is our guest host for the hour, Bloomberg Contributing Editor Nick Thompson. So, Nick, November 30th is supposed to be the deadline, but Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, has managed expectations lower, saying it's still going to be a work in progress beyond this date. And now the White House says - said that the website will work for the vast majority of users by the state. The problem seems to be the White House doesn't understand process is product. This process is what people are going to remember.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Yes. And that is absolutely true, but I do think they're making the right move. Clearly even if they fixed everything they've identified by November 30th there are still going to be lots of terrible things that happen because of the press that's come beforehand. There's going to be lots of negative press on everything that happens, every idea that gets hacked or something like that. So they do absolutely have to manage expectations. I think they've done a pretty good job of saying it's not going to work perfectly. It's scheduled for a Saturday so there won't be too much attention. And it - they actually in the last 48 hours have started sounding a lot more optimistic than before.</p><p/><p>FU: Okay.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: So maybe there's something we don't know.</p><p/><p>FU: Maybe, maybe. We'll see how that goes, but how does this compare with say the live, a performance of an e-commerce website that goes live? I know you've monitored lots of these kinds of things in the private sector. How does it compare?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: It compares a lot worse. They had an artificial - they had a deadline. A company that had as many problems like this, (a) would probably better identify that they had a clear product management. They wouldn't have as complicated a system because they wouldn't have you're built in and such a crazy, complex way. And they would have seen the problems and then they would have stopped. They would have had better project managers reporting more to the CEO. And I think they would have aborted the mission.</p><p/><p>KEENE: The Washington Post, and I believe it was this week, and I'll give them credit, had fabulous charts showing the state-by-state variance as we dive into this new form of health care. Who's winning the battle now? From where you sit, is there one state that stands out of getting it right?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Okay, Kentucky and California.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Kentucky was at the top of the fancy chart.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: It's interesting, right, because -</p><p/><p>KEENE: What are they doing in Kentucky?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: They've built - what's so interesting that there's a huge divide in how the health care law will be, will work in Republican states versus Democratic states, Republican states which have denied some of the goodies, Democratic states which have taken them. So in the long run that will be the big split, but in the beginning it's just the states that have set up the system, right? California you're not surprised. Of course their people there really focused on the technical aspects of health care.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Kentucky the system is based there. There was probably a lot more attention put on to it and they probably had good managers.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And are they making an activist effort to get the people that don't want to do this to do it, the healthy young kids? Is that the distinction?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: I think right now it's more of a technical and then it's - it's a technical distinction and then it will also become a cultural distinction once - I think what's going to happen with this health care law is once the system works, once people start doing it, you'll see it really spreading in states where it takes off because people will get the quotes. And they'll say, hey, this is good. They'll tell their friends.</p><p/><p>KEENE: When is that? When is that on my calendar?</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Tom.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Is it like March?</p><p/><p>FU: Next year.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Is it the third week of December? Is it 2016? What's the when?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: It's a year from now.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: You brought up a great point about young people -</p><p/><p>KEENE: Then what's the incentive.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: - and the fact that the real problem beyond the technical issues may be the fact that young people are not going to sign up in the necessary numbers to make this thing work. And my question is what -</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: They'll possibly have the patience.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: Yes. We're not going to definitely add a (inaudible).</p><p/><p>FU: We've talked to [Amazon] and it's not [right coupon].</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Right, yes.</p><p/><p>ALESCI: And the question is basically between and new premiums, possibly low youth unemployment and the fact that youths are having to repay larger and larger college bills, how much more of a strain is this on the youth of this country?</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Well it depends, right? If you consider it a strain because you have to pay monthly premiums, yes it's a strain. First of all, up to 26 you can stay on your parents' bill, so a lot of young people can do that. Secondly, it is going to save them a whole lot of money. If they don't get health insurance, and they have a big problem and they see their friends, and they get crushed and they realize, oh wait, there's actually this fairly cheap alternative, so it's not necessarily harmful for them. So all those trends might affect the other side of the equation.</p><p/><p>FU: Well we'll see if these younger, healthy people sign up en masse before November 30th.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: I know. And if they don't there's trouble, or -</p><p/><p>FU: Nick Thompson, Bloomberg Contributing Editor.</p><p/><p>THOMPSON: Before December 31st. They have to - they and again and start working November 30th and sign up in the next month. We'll see.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Very good.</p><p/><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

though that's as much the fault of governments who still haven't got their tax act together.</p><p>'The jiggery-pokery of tax planning by the large multinational tech companies is also guaranteed to inflame public opinion. </p><p>'It may all be impeccably legal but the impression that less tax is being paid than can reasonably be expected remains.'</p><p>He also dismissed claims that Cambridge Analytica swayed people's decision to vote Leave three years ago, despite the fact that up to 87 million people are believed to have had their data harvested by the political consultancy via a personality quiz app. </p><p>Sir Nick told BBC Radio 4's Today that Facebook had carried out analyses of its data and found no 'significant attempt' by outside forces to influence the referendum result.</p><p>He said: 'I'd accept we need to act but there is absolutely no evidence that it happened in the Brexit referendum.</p><p>'We ran two full analyses of all the data we had in the run up to the Brexit referendum, we shared all of this information with the select committee in Westminster and elsewhere.</p><p>'We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.' </p><p>Sir Nick was hired by billionaire Mark Zuckerberg to head up Facebook's global lobbying team last October after 'months of wooing' by the social network's founder.</p><p>He took over from PR chief Elliot Schrage, who quit in June 2018 after a series of damaging scandals.</p><p>His giant pay packet is not unusual for the 'big tech' industry, but dwarfs his recent MP's salary of \u00a377,379.</p><p>His role sees him lobby in Europe and the US where Facebook faces probes over its tax affairs and data breaches including the Cambridge Analytica scandal where app developers harvested information from millions of accounts.</p><p>The social network's woes last year wiped billions off its share price and Mr Zuckerberg's own \u00a350billion ($58bn) fortune.</p><p>He also defended his decision to take the job that saw him swap Westminster for the West Coast, saying he had 'always believed in grappling with difficult stuff'. </p><p>Asked about his decision to take the job after being in the heart of the UK government for five years he said: 'If there is any similarity between my choices in politics and my very different life now, it's that I've always believed in grappling with difficult stuff. </p><p>'It's so much easier to throw rocks at stuff and yell at it.</p><p>'I totally get it that some people don't like me for having done that in politics, just as much as now.</p><p>'I just kind of think this collision between the world of tech and our society is so important and I would just rather engage with it rather than try and ignore it.'</p><p>Sir Nick said today he had 'heard it claimed' that Facebook data had been used by Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 EU referendum. </p><p>'In fact the watchdog, the UK watchdog, which has the data, we don't, we can't even analyse the data because haven't got access to it, have said in terms that there was no raw data from Facebook on the servers of Cambridge Analytica,' he told the BBC.</p><p>'But more than that they confirmed before that no UK voters' Facebook data was involved. </p><p>                     Sir Nick Clegg: Former Lib Dem MP accused of wrecking his party                   </p><p>Sir Nick Clegg was deputy prime minister for five years in the Coalition government of David Cameron. </p><p>A relationship that started with joy in the rose gardens of Downing Street in 2010 ended in humiliation for the Lib Dems as they were routed in the 2015 election.</p><p>He resigned as leader and returned to the backbenches.</p><p>A year later, following the EU referendum, he became the party's Brexit spokesman but then lost the Sheffield Hallam seat he held for 12 years in 2017. </p><p>The father-of-three is married to Spanish city lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez.</p><p> The arch Remainer was among a number of Lib Dems showered with honours in recent years, with knighthoods for Vince Cable and Ed Davey, who both lost their seats in 2015 after serving in the Cabinet.</p><p>He has called for a second referendum and written a book called How To Stop Brexit. </p><p>He surprised UK politics by taking up the job with Facebook last year - moving full time to San Francisco in the new year. </p><p>'So yes, Facebook has a heavy responsibility to protect the integrity of elections from outside interference.</p><p>'I also think we have a duty to explain facts from some of the allegations that have been made.'</p><p>Numerous prominent Remain campaigners and senior political figures have suggested Russia helped to sway the result of the 2016 vote. </p><p>Some have even called for a public inquiry into the matter. </p><p>Sir Nick, an ardent Remainer, was asked if such claims were a 'myth' and a 'conspiracy theory' and he responded: 'Yes. </p><p>'I am someone who was debating with Nigel Farage before Facebook was invented and much though I understand why people want to reduce that eruption in British politics to some kind of plot or conspiracy or some use of new social media through opaque means, I am afraid the roots to British Euroscepticism go very, very deep. </p><p>'Candidly, over the last 40 years, have been much more influenced by traditional media than they have the new media.'</p><p>In February, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published a report on disinformation and fake news.</p><p>The 18-month inquiry looked into the effects of social media on society, Facebook's handling of users' data and allegations that the official Brexit campaigns broke electoral law during the referendum.</p><p>MPs have called for greater regulation of tech companies and Sir Nick said implementing new rules was not something they 'can or should' do on their own.</p><p>'It's not for private companies, however big or small, to come up with those rules. It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,' he said.</p><p>The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.</p><p>Also appearing on the BBC he said: 'He is technically wrong on that point which he should know.</p><p>'We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was - which they shared with us - on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.'</p><p>He added: 'There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and elsewhere.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53916905</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-TJV1-JCJY-G3X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1530\"/><timeReceived>7:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

To police all of that at scale is a real challenge.\"</p><p>The former Liberal Democrat leader added the company had no \"commercial incentive\" to show users \"hateful\" or \"extreme\" content. </p><p>He added: \"The very people we depend upon for the business, people who pay to place advertisements, the last thing they want is for that material to be placed next to that advertisement.\" </p><p>Sir Nick's comments come as the Government is expected to outline its plans in the coming weeks to impose a statutory duty of care on tech giants forcing them to better protect children from online harm, a measure campaigned for by The Telegraph.</p><p>In a White Paper published last year, ministers said they were considering creating an online regulator with powers to levy fines into the billions and even criminally prosecute senior tech executives for gross failures to keep users safe.</p><p>Last year, the father of Molly Russell, Ian, accused Instagram of 'helping to kill' his daughter after it emerged the app had been showing her suicide and self-harm content. </p><p>Following his comments, Instagram banned 'graphic' self-harm images and figures published by the company in November showed it had removed almost 1.7m images between April and September-close to 10,000 a day.</p><p>Responding to Sir Nick's comments, Molly Rose Foundation said despite pledges to clean up the platform Instagram and Facebook had not \"meaningfully changed the algorithms\" that shown Molly suicide and self-harm material. </p><p>A spokesman said: \"It is Facebook's responsibility to prioritise safety of young and vulnerable platform users. Yet a year since Molly's story became well known though international media, they continue to promote and circulate material Nick Clegg describes as \"hateful\" and \"unpleasant\". </p><p>\"It is beyond unacceptable that in these circumstances Facebook have failed to meaningfully change their algorithms. </p><p>\"Nick Clegg now admits Facebook has lost control of the situation they have created. It shows the extreme urgency needed for our Government to legislate for an independent regulator equipped with meaningful sanctions, that can prioritise safety of the young over the business interests of platform owners and advertisers.\"</p><p>Tony Stower, NSPCC head of child safety online and innovation, added: \"Nick Clegg seems to have inadvertently admitted what we've been saying for years, that Facebook has lost control of harmful content on its sites.</p><p>\"But it's simply not good enough to say they're trying when children are still being subjected to this damaging content and groomers continue to use Facebook's platforms to target young victims.</p><p>\"Government must urgently publish its Online Harms Bill armed with a tough regulator so big tech can't keep making excuses for failing in their duty of care without facing hefty fines and sanctions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59710462</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y27-PJS1-F021-62S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><timeReceived>6:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

He had been given some happy news to impart, including the creation of a centre for electoral integrity to try to fight political disinformation campaigns aimed at skewing elections. But the pained expression crept in when confronted on TV with examples of the kind of graphic Instagram posts that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nickclegglookingsad-blog.tumblr.com/\">14-year-old Molly Russell's</url> bereaved parents believe had a bearing on their daughter's suicide, and asked whether he would want his own children to see them. There is something horribly familiar about the sight of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nickclegglookingsad-blog.tumblr.com/\">Clegg publicly squirming</url> over the consequences of things he doesn't quite have the power to stop, as if the coalition years were happening all over again in slow motion.</p><p>Former party leaders have to do something with the rest of their lives, obviously. Like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before him, Clegg is far too young to retire, and it seems he has said all he wants to say about Brexit. A corporate gig does at least beat making expensive speeches to bankers or offering private advice to foreign governments with murky human rights records. But the sight of a former deputy prime minister spinning for Mark Zuckerberg feels nonetheless symbolic of everything that is wrong with the relationship between big tech and politics. Clegg used to help run the country, and now Facebook seems to be running him. Is that really the way it's meant to work?</p><p>There has been a revolving door between Whitehall and Silicon Valley for many years now, with a steady stream of former special advisers being snapped up by the Googles and the Ubers and the Facebooks. It makes sense on one level - both politics and tech are bewilderingly fast-moving, complex environments with significant impact on ordinary lives and people who have worked in one are perhaps unusually suited to working in the other - but it also illustrates the problem. The single biggest threat to the seemingly unstoppable rise of the tech oligarchs would be a government with teeth, prepared either to regulate platforms more strictly or to tax them more heavily. These companies, like any company, will naturally seek to anticipate and where possible frustrate any political threat to their business model. The obvious way of doing that is hiring people with understanding of, and preferably influence over, the political process.</p><p>But the <url normalizedValue=\"http://nickclegglookingsad-blog.tumblr.com/\">Facebook empire</url> (which also includes Whatsapp and Instagram among other platforms) now has a broader reputational problem, too. Even if it could square off the politicians, its own users don't like what they are hearing about everything from invasions of their personal privacy to the toxification of public debate and the role of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nickclegglookingsad-blog.tumblr.com/\">social media</url> in fuelling the rise of far-right movements. By hiring a politician rather than an anonymous former special adviser, Facebook seems to be trying to engage directly with the public.</p><p>It's a risk for both sides. Politicians are used to articulating their own views, not parroting other people's, and it may take Clegg a while to get used to answering questions about the limits of regulation in Zuckerberg's voice rather than his own. But the bigger reputational risk is perhaps to Clegg personally, and, by association, the Liberal Democrats in general, whose members care more than most about questions of privacy, freedom of speech and civil liberties.</p><p>He has presumably gone in believing that Facebook really does want to be a force for good now; that it's better to be in the room when the decisions are taken than outside railing hopelessly against them, and that whatever concessions he can extract are worth the awkward compromises that will sometimes need to be made. And yes, all that may sound a bit familiar to Liberal Democrats who lived through the coalition years. Let's hope that's not an omen.</p><p> Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51257416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9F-7F31-F021-625P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><timeReceived>12:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.
