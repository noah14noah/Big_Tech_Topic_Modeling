Meanwhile, Google is mired in a protracted legal dispute over its right to create an online archive of the world's library books, including millions still in copyright. At first glance, these two pieces of news don't have much in common, but both are part of a battle being waged by the world's big-tech companies for dominance of the digital future.</p><p>One way to get a handle on the digital world is to think of it as a new, uncharted landmass, one that has become navigable thanks to the internet. Beyond this new frontier - a kind of 21st-century wild west - lies a terrain where scarcely unimaginable wealth is waiting to be unlocked. Only this time the key battle isn't over a physical resource but over a non-physical one: information. Information is the real estate of the digital age and it is this that the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple are in the business of exploiting, whether by providing it free, by owning it or by controlling the channels through which it can be sold and delivered.</p><p>The opening up of this frontier raises big questions. What do we want the digital realm to look like? Do we want it to be controlled by a few large companies or should it be more pluralistic and democratic? The distrust that many of us feel toward a company such as Google (even while we enthusiastically use its products) stems from a fear that it may be seizing control of this territory before most of us even quite appreciated what was there.</p><p>We are both right and wrong to be worried. Right, because it is true that there is a potential for monopolies to be created, and because crucial legal rights, in particular, intellectual property, are in danger of being trampled on as we highlight elsewhere in the paper.</p><p>But at the same time, it is important to remember that we have reasons to be grateful for the existence of big, innovative corporations. Just as in the 19th century it was only the railway companies that had the muscle to \"open up\" the American west, so it is the Googles and Apples of our day that have the vision and wealth to unlock the resources of the digital realm. Apple can create wonders like the Apple Tablet because it has the money to hire the world's best inventors; and Google can scan most of the world's library books because it has the vision and chutzpah to undertake such a venture.</p><p>However, it is imperative that such companies are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and proper regulatory vigilance so that dangerous acquisitions of power don't take place.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-090729300809c0242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WGY-VM41-2R8R-V0PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (London)  (England)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 30, 2009</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CF4G</classCode><className>TABLET COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX002177</classCode><className>RAIL TRANSPORTATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk</classCode><className>Railroads &amp; Rail Transportation</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

This ethos served the community well when its firms existed at 'pirate scale.' </p><p>But now Silicon Valley's most successful companies have become some of the largest in the world. This culture must accept that it has become the Navy, with its remaining pirates facing a choice \u2014 enlist or walk the plank. Perhaps no company is struggling with this reality more than Google. Founded in 1998, the company famously adopted the motto 'Don't be evil' around the year 2000. Ever since, whenever the company has run into controversy, such as\u00a0its censorship disputes with China, or its recent decision to\u00a0fire the author\u00a0of a controversial memo citing gender differences, critics have lashed out at the company over its betrayal of its founding values.But it's not fair to hold Google, or its parent company Alphabet, to the same principles it adopted when it was a relatively inconsequential technology startup. In the year 2000, when it adopted 'Don't be evil,' Googlehad revenue of\u00a0just over $19 million. In 2017, it will have revenue of over $100 billion.\u00a0That's higher than the gross domestic product of\u00a0a dozen states. Google\u00a0dropped\u00a0the 'Don't be evil' motto in 2015. Googleis by no means alone in being a large technology company struggling to balance historical 'pirate' cultures with growing responsibilities as powerful corporations. Facebook has gotten in trouble for allowing 'fake news' on its platform, influencing the 2016 election. Twitter has struggled with harassment and hate groups. And Uber has clashed with regulators, its drivers and the impact of its internal culture on women.\u00a0 Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Silicon Valley has a lot of self-interested reasons for preferring to maintain a facade that its culture is special, and that its industry is more innovative, virtuous and productive than every other industry. It serves as a great recruiting tool as the region competes for talent with other industries and areas. It allows insiders\u00a0to maintain outsize control of their companies. And it is a way to prevent regulators from coming in and regulating Silicon Valley to the extent that it might\u00a0otherwise seek to do. But it's time to drop the pretense that these big tech companies deserve special treatment. Facebook and Googleare content and advertising companies, digital evolutions of print and television companies that came before them. Amazon's core e-commerce business is just a digital Wal-Mart. Apple's iPhone product cycle, with its annual incremental improvements, has parallels to the personal-computer industry in the 1990s or even the Detroit 'Big Three' automakers in the 1960s. They deserve the same scrutiny from regulatory and labor watchdogs that their old-economy peers get. They shouldn't\u00a0have multiple classes of shares that deprive investors of voting rights. Tesla and Amazon both show that investors are willing to look past a lack of near-term profitability if they believe in a company's vision. As Snap, the latest IPO that has fizzled, may be showing, when a hot growth story turns cold and investors lack voting rights, there's no opportunity for an activist or turnaround investor to come in and pressure management.And employees should stop thinking that working for a large technology company is fundamentally different from working anywhere else. Despite what Silicon Valley would like you to believe, employees at Googleand Facebook should have the same expectations that workers at Goldman Sachs, General Electric or\u00a0McKinsey have in terms of adequate staffing of human-resources departments and what is considered acceptable speech at work. Uber's CEO search, with leaders of 'stodgy' companies having been floated as possible successors \u2014 Meg Whitman of HP, and Jeffrey Immelt, formerly of GE \u2014 shows that even the bad boy of tech may be getting the message. The sooner the whole industry wises up, the better.

likely affect their willingness to pursue other cases,\" Vinje said.- 'Hoopla' -Behind the scenes, some experts wonder whether Vestager's reputation as a slayer of big tech may be overblown.\"Despite the hoopla, Vestager has in fact had little very impact on digital markets in Europe. </p><p>She's far too friendly to big tech and she lets them design their own remedies,\" tweeted Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute, which recommends competition policies. \"European enforcers are more talk than action,\" he added.Lobbyists for big tech are in fact more afraid of another nomination to the commission team that takes office on November 1.Former French defence minister Sylvie Goulard is set to take over the single market portfolio with responsiblity to draw up new legislation on how big tech platforms can do business in Europe.The ambitiously named Digital Services Act will be the battle royale for lobbyists in the next months and years as worry runs deep that interventionist France and Germany may demand strict curbs on Amazon, Google and Facebook.\"With Goulard running the single market, things will get heated,\" a senior lobbyist said on condition of anonymity.France and Germany meanwhile will keep a close eye on Vestager.The EU's most powerful members, they are furious over her veto earlier this year of a Siemens and Alsthom rail business merger that they say denied the creation of a European champion in the industry, a gift to Chinese rivals.They now demand deep reform of EU competition law, which Vestager said she would consider, but only after sounding out \"many different voices\".\"It is competition that creates the champions we need,\" she added in an interview with AFP on Tuesday.

That's down 48 spots from No. 31 on the 2013 list. It was the 14th steepest decline of any city in the country, and the only one of the top 35 to fall so dramatically. Erie, which is also on the list, dropped 85 places, from No. 96 to No. 181.</p><p>Peoria, Ill., dropped the most, 102 spots, to rank No. 157.</p><p>There wasn't a specific reason for Pittsburgh's decline, although the Milken Institute noted Pennsylvania had the most cities on on the biggest decliners list - five - of any state.</p><p>\"Metros experiencing the largest declines were concentrated in Middle Atlantic and New England states. To some extent, longer-term subpar growth trends are re-emerging, after having been masked during the Great Recession,\" the report said. \"Most of these metros have more service-based economies that didn't experience as severe a decline as many with a greater reliance on manufacturing.\"</p><p>The report doesn't include quality of life in its metrics, but looks at wage growth, job growth, high-tech GDP growth and the number of high-tech industries.</p><p>What were the top cities? San Francisco edged out last year's top city, Austin, Texas, for the No. 1 spot. Austin was No. 2. The Milken Institute pointed out a similarity between the top five cities: big tech sectors. The rest of the top five were Provo, Utah; San Jose, Calif. and Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>\"Many of the Best-Performing Cities of 2014 possess what we call the 'innovation advantage,'\" said Ross DeVol, chief research officer of the Milken Institute, in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/newsroom/press-releases/view/265\">a statement</url>. \"Cities like San Francisco and San Jose are able to offset high costs, an unfavorable tax structure and a burdensome regulatory environment, thanks to the clustering of talent and technology in an entrepreneurial ecosystem.\"</p><p>Here's how Pittsburgh fared in each of the statistics:</p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Job Growth, 2008-13: 64</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Job Growth, 2012-13: 184</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Wage Growth, 2007-12: 24</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Wage Growth, 2011-12: 55</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Short-term Job Growth, 8/2013-8/14: 145</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>High-tech GDP Growth, 2008-13: 61</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>High-tech GDP Growth, 2012-13: 156</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>High-Tech GDP Concentration: 62</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Number of High-Tech Industries: 67</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Did you find this article useful?

But it seems he overstated the case when he said, a few years ago, that in the next five to 10 years we would start to see banks failing because they had not embraced digital.\"I think that was wrong,\" he says now. \"Three years down the road, I'm not seeing any banks getting to the stage of failing in the short term. There's a lot more resilience than I anticipated.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Piyush Gupta,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DBS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, he thinks if banks are going to fail, it will be a matter of capital, not liquidity, as beating the cost of capital becomes more difficult.</p><p>Gupta says there is still plenty more disruption to do, particularly around big data, AI, partnership and blockchain. But, asked if the threat he anticipated from the likes of Ant Financial has materialized, he admits: \"I expected more.\"</p><p>He thinks there are two reasons. One is that as big players go outside their home markets, they face more headwinds.</p><p>\"For many people in China, you could make a big difference, because the underlying payment methods are inefficient. But when you come to Singapore, people already just flash their card anyway. Outside home markets, it has not been that easy.\"</p><p>The second reason is that in the last two years regulations have become more level, he says. \"In the early years, for a decade, all of big tech and fintech had massive regulatory arbitrage.\" That is narrowing.</p><p>\"But don't get me wrong, they are still our biggest nightmare.\"</p><p>DBS, like many, is trying to weather difficult market circumstances. Its record 2018 full-year result, while impressive overall, disguised a 21% decline in full-year treasury and markets income.</p><p>Gupta says diversification has helped the bank weather difficult times in the markets. DBS's market-making business has certainly been hit; ordinarily Gupta expects it to account for 10% to 12% of the bank's income \"\" it is down to 6%.</p><p>\"But it used to be 20%, and I deliberately drove it down,\" he says. \"I wanted to halve it. But the slide from 10% to 6% is not deliberate: we are finding the market making much harder.\"</p><p>Gupta says the markets business itself is more diversified than it used to be: \"Earlier, I used to make $600 million on the customer franchise and $1.2 billion on the market making. Now it's the reverse.\"</p><p>Furthermore, the strengthening of cash management and trade finance provides insulation.</p><p>\"In a decade, cash [cash management plus securities and fiduciary services] has gone from 10% of the bank to a third of the bank. That really moves the needle. If I can keep that engine stable, it pays for a lot of other headwinds.\"Trade war</p><p>Despite weakness in wealth management in the fourth quarter \"\" \"people just froze\" \"\" and in the capital markets \"\" \"in the back half of last year there was no deal flow in Asia\" \"\" Gupta does not think the US-China trade war threat is being felt in his businesses.</p><p>\"In real dollars and cents terms, there is some slowdown in trade, but it's not huge,\" he says. \"And there is no material shift in supply chains that I can see.\"</p><p>He says that people have been moving plants and machinery out of China into Vietnam and Indonesia, but says this has been happening for years.</p><p>\"It is nothing to do with the trade war. As best as I can tell, people are willing to expand marginal new capacity outside China, but they're not actually closing down the assembly line in China.\" Technology, in particular, \"is a very tightly integrated ecosystem. You can't just move the plant without all the suppliers and the chips and so on.\"</p><p>Some recent staff moves at DBS have caught the eye.</p><p>Tan Su Shan, a considerable success in running the consumer and wealth parts of the bank, was made the head of the institutional banking division, a role she began on February 1. Ten days later, Han Kwee Juan, former chief executive of Citibank Singapore, was hired to head the strategy and planning division. Shee Tse Koon, who held that role previously, is the country head for Singapore.</p><p>It looks like a cluster of potential successors being assembled.</p><p>\"I'm trying to build a succession bench,\" Gupta says. \"I've got four or five candidates all plus or minus 50, who, with the right grooming, have the potential to take my job some day.</p><p>\"Not soon,\" he adds.</p><p>The moves came about partly because of Jeanette Wong's retirement from the head of institutional role.</p><p>\"It gave me an opportunity to reshuffle the deck,\" Gupta says. \"I'm a big believer in having generalists. One of the reasons I'm a good banker is I know a little bit about everything: I've run mortgages, I've done cards, consumer, corporate banking, transaction banking. So to me, getting someone [Tan] who runs consumer and wealth and have her run the corporate side of the business is helpful.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1f9jq9pmld8c1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6J-S9H1-F0GS-H495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000162</classCode><className>BANK FAILURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DG3K</classCode><className>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000718</classCode><className>FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000162</classCode><className>BANK FAILURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The EU has Open Banking, which compels the easy sharing of information between banks and fintechs over secure platforms (APIs), while the US has no such thing.\u00a0</p><p>So hundreds of US apps, which offer everything from savings hacks and budgeting tools to peer-to-peer payments, typically connect to customers\u2019 bank accounts through aggregators such as Plaid and its competitors Yodlee and Finicity.\u00a0</p><p>Aggregators can use APIs that allow them to get a limited feed of data from banks. Or\u00a0they can request an individual\u2019s banking log-on details and use that to take information directly from their online accounts.\u00a0</p><p>Banks have become increasingly concerned about the potential for aggregators to harvest \u2014 and sell \u2014 a vast amount of customers\u2019 data without those customers necessarily understanding what they were signing up for.\u00a0</p><p>America\u2019s biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, has already vowed to\u00a0end \u00a0the practice of \u201cscreen scraping\u201d, which allows aggregators to log into customers\u2019 accounts and retrieve data, in favour of an API-only approach that sends a limited amount of data.</p><p>Its chief executive Jamie Dimon returned to the theme on the bank\u2019s earnings call last week, criticising today\u2019s system under which \u201cif you gave your bank pass code to someone, they\u2019re taking your data every day, maybe even every minute, and you don't even know about it because you forgot\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Other banks, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, are also active in industry efforts to promote API solutions over screen-scraping. US regional bank PNC hit the headlines in December when it\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-glitch-opens-window-on-war-between-banks-fintech-firms-11576319402\"> tightened</url>\u00a0the ways it allowed non-banks to access data. That led to a\u00a0backlash from customers, encouraged by payments fintech Venmo that suggested users tweet: \u201cHey @PNCBank\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Let me use the financial service apps I need!\u201d</p><p>Last week, three senior Democrats asked the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/478766-lawmakers-call-for-ftc-probe-into-top-financial-data-aggregator\"> to investigate</url>\u00a0Envestnet for how it deals with data. Envestnet owns Yodlee, the largest consumer data aggregator in the US.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe consumer data that Envestnet collects and sells is highly sensitive,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter to the FTC. \u201cAnd the more often that consumers\u2019 personal information is bought and sold, the greater the risk that it could be the subject of a data breach.\u201d</p><p>Envestnet said the firm operated \u201cin compliance with law and regulations and in accordance with leading industry practices for data security, regulatory compliance and privacy\u201d and welcomed \u201cinformed discussion\u201d about ways to enhance data privacy.\u00a0</p><p>Chad Wiechers, vice-president of operations and general counsel at Envestnet, told the FT that Yodlee\u2019s protocols already included monitoring end-users\u2019 engagement with the platforms and slowing down the collection of data and eventually stopping it if the user is dormant. </p><p>Sam Maule, North American managing partner of consultancy 11:FS, said Visa\u2019s acquisition of Plaid could \u201chelp drive standardisation concerning security and access issues in the aggregation space\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always firmly believed \u2018open banking\u2019 standards in the US will be most likely market-driven,\u201d he added. \u201cVisa is at that size and scale that can actually drive standardisation to some extent in this space.\u201d</p><p>Quick Fire Q&amp;A</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company name?\u00a0</emphasis>Clearcover</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">When founded?\u00a0</emphasis>2016</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where based?</emphasis>\u00a0Chicago</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEO?</emphasis>\u00a0Kyle Nakatsuji\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you sell, and who do you sell it to?</emphasis>\u00a0By using modern technology, Clearcover offers drivers better car insurance for less money.

The aggrieved public informed that till date three job card holders have fainted while standing in queue under the pressure of heat and crowd, yet no alternative counter has been opened to speed up the payment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi has left no stone unturned to push his government's flagship programme- Digital India, to steer the nation towards e-governance, e-commerce and most importantly of all e-banking, whereas, non-traditional competition is posing a challenge to traditional banking services. A new Capgemini report 'World Retail Banking Report 2018' on September 21, 2018 showed that globally just half of the customers are satisfied with their banking experiences, and nearly a third of customers (32.3 percent) are willing to consider big tech companies for financial products and services.</p><p>The report based on insights of customers and senior banking executives in over 40 countries, including India, charts the current perspectives and potential evolution of traditional banks amid the continued emergence of big technology and financial tech players in the financial services space.</p><p>The findings suggest that retail banks need to collaborate and personalise customer experience, as satisfaction was notably higher among those customers who had been offered personalised digital experiences proactively (49.1 percent) than those who had not (39.5 percent). This was indicated by the research conducted in collaboration with Paris-headquartered global non-profit Efma.</p><p>The report also surveyed banking executives about the main causes of industry disruption. The most-cited factor was rising customer expectations, with nearly three out of four executives (70.8 per cent) stating that positive experiences in other sectors mean customers now expect more from their banking provider. A majority of executives (58.3 per cent) also said that regulatory pressure was a cause of disruption, while 54.2 per cent identified the increasing demand for digital channels as a factor. A significant majority of banking executives (70.8 per cent) think they can generate non-traditional revenue via collaboration with major technology companies.</p><p>In Meghalaya too, the banking services are deteriorating. The banking institution after the demonetization has exposed the poor banking system in the state, with its existing Core Banking Solutions (CBS), designed for 'class banking' and not for 'mass banking'.</p><p>According to experts, the CBS has to be geared up for small-value and large-volume transactions. The rule that a higher volume reduces cost per account does not apply here (because the cost is constant). Once more rural customers come into the picture, the Know Your Customer (KYC) norms would also have to be spruced up. At present, the KYC norms have been simplified and not all fields are filled up, also, the anywhere-banking facility may not be used by rural customers.</p><p>Meghalaya- where many still prefer to save their money in piggy banks and many still hide their cash and other valuables at various secured corners in their respective houses, all have now been compelled to open bank accounts.</p><p>Lately, all government payments too are being transferred via bank accounts. More than for security, this is an attempt to move towards India being a nation where cashless transactions are the norm rather than the exception. However, all transactions via banks still lack detailing to verify the source of payment.</p><p>With regard to education loans, students have to move from pillar to post even for the small loans below four lakhs of rupees. It is often seen that the applicants are forced to mortgage which is against instructions. Many of the students have to give up their dreams for higher studies because of the attitude of the banking institutions.</p><p>The Meghalaya Government, if required should encourage banking of government transaction via cooperative banks of the state which will not only release the pressure on the nationalized banks, but will also improve services.</p><p>The Credit - Deposit ratio in the state too needs to be beefed up which will in turn be a fillip to the economic growth of the state. The banking services in the state should also be extended to the grassroots who will benefit in an environment where there is no need for the enactment of a Bill to recover bad loans.</p><p>RBI needs to take special attention on the lending formalities in this Hill State, where many banks refuse to sanction loans where landed property is taken as mortgage in areas where the Special Land protection Act is enforced. Also, more than car loans, the banking institutions here should extend their services to support the now defunct Meghalaya Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), to formulate more entrepreneurship ventures, which are both environmental friendly and where employment avenues are high, otherwise all the brainstorming in any of the bi-monthly monetary policy review will not benefit Meghalaya.</p><p>Once it is done, such congestion in the banks will be reduced and particularly the state owned banks will be in better position, and force the SBI to perform or they can be black listed for poor services like the present one for the Plainbelt's Bank customers.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Meghalaya Times.

The delay will worry parents, teachers and carers already alarmed over the failure to use legislation to tackle the crisis of young children owning and using smartphones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, Communications Minister Denis Naughten insisted the online czar would definitely be appointed - even though Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pooh-pooed the idea at the time.</p><p>Yesterday, the minister conceded this would not happen and claimed the legislation required was more complex than originally envisaged. However, the Government's new online safety plan strongly hinted it would never happen.

This is a sure sign that there is no intention by Government to establish such an office, despite their previous commitments. It should be front and centre of any proposals.' He continued: 'I suspect that the Government does not want to do anything that will upset tech giants that are located here. Ireland is where every tech company that matters is located.</p><p>'To suggest that we have to wait for international best practice to evolve to move on digital safety is a cop-out.' But the Taoiseach suggested tech firms can be trusted to police themselves, saying: 'In fairness to the big tech companies that are active online, any time I meet them they are very in tune to this issue.' Comment - Page 14 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sean.dunne@dailymail.ie\">sean.dunne@dailymail.ie</email></p><p>Online safety plan that only mentions pornography once THE Government's Action Plan for Online Safety makes little reference to the harmful effect that easy access to hard pornography can have on children. The 55-page document has only one reference to children's easy access to such material on smartphones and tablets - in a section called Stronger Protections. Curiously, it states: 'We are only in the early stages of understanding how smartphone usage affects how and when users consume content and its impact.' This is despite a slew of reports and warnings from experts, including Dr Mary Aiken, one of the world's leading cyber security experts, who believes children should have no unsupervised access to smartphones. A report last month by the 5Rights Foundation in the UK, which advocates for children online, found tech firms deploy an 'unfettered use of persuasive design' that encourages children to keep clicking - and accused them of a 'cavalier disregard for childhood'. And the French government is bringing in laws to ban smartphones in schools for children up to the age of 15.</p><p>Hollow praise from Minister Bruton EDUCATION Minister Richard Bruton has praised schools for their 'good work' on the safe use of mobile technology - despite the Government's failure to contact schools who have successfully introduced a smartphone ban. 'There is a lot of good things happening too in schools and, just at this moment, we are consulting with schools about the safe use of mobile technology within schools and what we should do about it,' he said. 'We see some people are being particularly innovative in this area.' Despite praising 'innovation', Minister Bruton and the Government failed to contact Terry O'Sullivan about the online safety policy. Mr O'Sullivan is the Kerry principal who received nationwide acclaim after agreeing a smartphonefree policy at his school in Blennerville. This was a boost for the Irish Daily Mail's campaign for a minimum age for smartphone ownership. It was also a blow to the tech industry apologists and political hand-wringers who claim such measures are unnecessary and unworkable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pioneer: Terry O'SullivanLaunch: Taoiseach with \u00c1ine Lynch of the National Parents Council yesterday</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-139515433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSH-YCD1-JBVM-Y4J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The delay will worry parents, teachers and carers already alarmed over the failure to use legislation to tackle the crisis of young children owning and using smartphones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, Communications Minister Denis Naughten insisted the online czar would definitely be appointed - even though Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pooh-poohed the idea at the time.</p><p>Yesterday, the minister conceded this would not happen and claimed the legislation required was more complex than originally envisaged. However, the Government's new online safety plan strongly hinted it would never happen. The plan does pay lip service to the idea of a czar, but tech companies are understood to have been angered at the notion of a regulator with powers to tell them how they must act, as they want to regulate themselves.</p><p>While Mr Naughten indicated that he still hoped to establish a Digital Safety Commissioner, yesterday's web safety plan picked a number of holes in the notion of having one.</p><p>The report, presented by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, said the commissioner would have two main functions - and that one of these was already being done elsewhere, while the other could only be done with international cooperation.</p><p>Child safety charities yesterday reacted with concern at the apparent shelving of the position, with the ISPCC warning that the tech companies could not simply be left to regulate themselves.</p><p>The new, grandly titled Action Plan for Online Safety will see the establishment of a national advisory council on internet safety headed by a Governmentappointed politician.</p><p>However, the plan was criticised as nothing more than a 'cop-out' and 'talking shop' by the Labour Party yesterday. Its spokesman on Children and Youth Affairs, Se\u00e1n Sherlock, said: 'Once again we have another talking shop that will stall any regulation of online safety and do nothing to assuage the fears of parents who want a safe and regulated online space.</p><p>'There are 25 goals outlined in the plan but the only mention of a Digital Commissioner is in goal 18. This is a sure sign that there is no intention by Government to establish such an office, despite their previous commitments. It should be front and centre of any proposals.' He continued: 'I suspect that the Government does not want to do anything that will upset tech giants that are located here. Ireland is where every tech company that matters is located.</p><p>'To suggest that we have to wait for international best practice to evolve to move on digital safety is a cop-out.' But the Taoiseach suggested tech firms can be trusted to police themselves, saying: 'In fairness to the big tech companies that are active online, any time I meet them they are very in tune to this issue.' Comment - Page 14 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sean.dunne@dailymail.ie\">sean.dunne@dailymail.ie</email> Online safety plan that only mentions pornography once THE Government's Action Plan for Online Safety makes little reference to the harmful effect easy access to hardcore pornography can have on children.</p><p>The 55-page document has only one reference to children's easy access to such material on smartphones and tablets - in a section called Stronger Protections.</p><p>Curiously, it states: 'We are only in the early stages of understanding how smartphone usage affects how and when users consume content and its impact.' This is despite a slew of reports and warnings from experts, including Dr Mary Aiken, one of the world's leading cyber security experts, who believes children should have no unsupervised access to smartphones.</p><p>A report last month by the 5Rights Foundation in the UK, which advocates for children online, found tech firms deploy an 'unfettered use of persuasive design' that encourages children to keep clicking - and accused them of a 'cavalier disregard for childhood'. And the French government is bringing in laws to ban smartphones in schools for children up to the age of 15.</p><p>Hollow praise from Minister Bruton EDUCATION Minister Richard Bruton has praised schools for their 'good work' on the safe use of mobile technology - despite the Government's failure to contact schools who have successfully introduced a smartphone ban.</p><p>'There is a lot of good things happening too in schools and, just at this moment, we are consulting with schools about the safe use of mobile technology within schools and what we should do about it,' he said. 'We see some people are being particularly innovative in this area.' Despite praising 'innovation', Minister Bruton and the Government failed to contact Terry O'Sullivan about the online safety policy. Mr O'Sullivan is the Kerry principal who received nationwide acclaim after agreeing a smartphonefree policy at his school in Blennerville. This was a boost for the Irish Daily Mail's campaign for a minimum age for smartphone ownership. It was also a blow to the tech industry apologists and political hand-wringers who claim such measures are unnecessary and unworkable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Launch: The Taoiseach with \u00c1ine Lynch of the National Parents Council yesterdayPioneer: Terry O'Sullivan</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-139515411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSH-YCD1-JBVM-Y4JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLG6</classCode><className>CHILD SAFETY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IZW</classCode><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Advances in automated machine learning vastly simplify complex data science work. Ambitious data analysts, business intelligence professionals, data engineers, and software developers around the world already started experimenting with automated machine learning. Some of these novice citizen data scientists delivered staggering multi-million-dollar returns on investment. Others share stories about disappointing, preventable failures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Don't ignore, fear or fight technological progression. Lead your organization forward in a responsible manner. Citizen data scientists won't replace your existing data scientists. They simply allow your organization to extract more value from massive troves of data.</p><p>If you have an existing analytics center of excellence program, plan to add machine learning, artificial intelligence, and citizen data science into it. If you don't have one, plan to create one. According to a recent survey of U.S. executives from large firms using artificial intelligence, 37% said they had already established such an organization.</p><p>Much like the prior traditional IT-led BI to self-service analytics evolution, the current citizen data science movement requires enterprise-level governance, protections, robust model management, auditing, collaboration, training, and ongoing mentoring from experts to avoid costly mistakes. In contrast to the earlier market shift, the organizational learning curve for machine learning is quite a bit steeper. From gaining project sponsorship from executives and recognizing appropriate use cases to understanding and translating results effectively to the business, machine learning is far less intuitive than reporting.</p><p>It is also much easier to make errors or introduce unintended bias on machine learning projects that no one will find until it is too late. Your citizen data science team will need another level of documentation, change management, and auditing for reliable, trustworthy decision making. In quarterly shareholder calls, several of the top four big tech vendors now issue public warnings about these risks after embarrassing public failures. No company will be immune to these challenges.</p><p>On the upside, the compelling bottom line outcomes of applying automated machine learning cannot be ignored. The data science talent gap is being exploited as a game-changing competency in the algorithm economy. Citizen data scientists are the ideal resources to tap for creatively sustaining and growing your company profitably with data.</p><p>Like many analytics projects in an enterprise, citizen data science is a team sport. Your team will likely include an Executive Sponsor, Data Scientist and Citizen Data Scientist. In regulated industries, Model Risk Analysts are another common team member. These core roles will work with other groups in your organization to get data and integrate machine learning models into processes, reports or applications.</p><p>Budget accordingly for executives to learn basic machine learning concepts. Skilled data talent will need initial hands-on training and ongoing guidance from expert data science resources to succeed. Look for short practical citizen data science programs that focus on solving business problems with an automated data science solution rather than data science theory or heavy programming focused courses.</p><p>When selecting ideal citizen data science candidates to train, search for existing inquisitive \"power users\" of reporting tools your decision makers already lean on for complicated, ad-hoc reporting. This talent usually already knows how to query and prepare data. Their curious, ambitious nature will be an asset in when applying machine learning to solve business problems.</p><p>Before your citizen data science team starts to build and use machine learning models, establish machine learning tool standards, a governance framework, project templates, change management and results review processes. Humans must analyze machine findings, sign off on models, and continue to keep an eye on prediction performance over time. Models can constantly change and degrade.</p><p>Don't overlook the importance of documenting intended model usage, design methodology, development assumptions, alternatives considered, dependencies on other models, data sources, data preparation steps, model change reasons, known limitations and issues. If questions or problems do arise, your citizen data science team and potentially a third-party should be able to decipher and clarify how and why your model makes different predictions.</p><p>Ensure your chosen automated machine learning solution incorporates industry best practices and provides full transparency to detect potential issues right away. Scrutinize citizen data science tools closely. Many current wizard and button click automated machine learning tools use risky black box approaches or lack critical capabilities to decode, explain or protect your team from accidental mistakes.</p><p>I've witnessed the right way and wrong way to approach citizen data science initiatives. If you have already gone through the self-service analytics transition and established governance for those tools, you're in great shape to start expanding into citizen data science.

from air quality to the frequency of park bench usage - in order to further develop the neighbourhood and make it more liveable.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered 18 months ago to announce the project, amid much fanfare.</p><p>However, resistance to the project is growing in the form of a public campaign, a lawsuit and a prominent resignation - with the firm having failed to assuage concerns it will not abuse data gathered by the smart city.</p><p>'I don't think they look so happy now,' Paula Fletcher, a Toronto City Council member, told the Washington Post.</p><p>'This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.'</p><p>A campaign to #BlockSidewalk began in February, after the Toronto Star revealed that Sidewalk Labs were contemplating financing infrastructure and transit developments on a larger part of the waterfront than previously announced.</p><p>Leaked documents suggested that, in return, the firm would seek to receive part of the profits generated by Quayside from development fees, property taxes and rising land values.</p><p>These profits had been estimated at $6 billion CAD (\u00a33.4 billion GBP/$4.5 billion USD) over a 30 year period. </p><p>A spokesperson from Sidewalk Labs said that the proposal had not been publicly announced because it was still under debate - but the revelations have failed to paint the company's commitment to transparency in a good light.</p><p>'It's our job to remind everybody that \"no\" is an option and that consent is important,' said Bianca Wylie, a leader of the #BlockSidewalk movement. </p><p>'The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.'</p><p>In addition, Wylie said that cities are granting too much power to big tech companies like the Alphabet-subsidiary, even as regulators struggle to rein them in. </p><p>A spokesperson for Sidewalk Labs, Micah Lasher, acknowledged that missteps may have been made and that providing more information on Quayside's business model and planned data-handling policies may have helped to allay concerns. </p><p>Trying to downplay the firm's corporate links to Google, Sidewalk Labs have said that they will not be trying to monetise the smart city's data collection - and have proposed that such activities be managed by a data trust to prevent misuse.</p><p>However, Mr Lasher noted, the company has definitely struggled to find the best time to unveil such plans. </p><p>'If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,' he said.</p><p>'If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.' </p><p>Waterfront Toronto advisory panel member and University of Toronto information scientist Andrew Clement said that Sidewalk labs have left many questions about the proposed data trust unanswered.</p><p>Instead of fully addressing these concerns, he added, the firm have been distracting the public with new technological concepts that the city might feature.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs had agreed to spend $50 million CAD (\u00a328 million GBP/$37 million USD) on a year-long process of public consultations to inform their development proposal.</p><p>Plans would need to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, the corporation that is overseeing the development of the Port Lands area on behalf of the government.</p><p>Any such proposal needs the approval of both Waterfront Toronto and several government bodies in order to go ahead.</p><p>However, plans are already months behind schedule, with Sidewalk Labs having originally been expected to present their designs in June 2018. </p><p>Alongside delays and public backlash, privacy concerns have also encouraged the Canadian Civil Liberties Association to sue the city, federal and provincial governments to shut down the Quayside project. </p><p>Association executive director Michael Bryant said that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had been 'seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.' </p><p>The Port Lands development scheme - and Quayside in particular - have already faced a number of embarrassments over the project's transparency.</p><p>In October 2018, former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian resigned from a consulting position at Sidewalk over concerns that the smart city would not be able to gain consent from everyone on whom it gathered data.</p><p>This was followed in December by the revelation from the Ontario auditor general that Waterfront Toronto had given preferential treatment to Sidewalk in its selection of the Alphabet-owned firm as its partner.</p><p>The auditor general had called at the time for an increase in government oversight of the development project. </p><p>The groundswell of both public and political resistance to the project bears similarities to the pushback against Amazon's plans to construct a secondary headquarters in New York's Long Island City.</p><p>The unanticipated criticism of the development came from activists, union leader and lawyers, who objected to proposals that the wealthy retail firm might be granted in excess of a billion dollars in government subsidies if the plans went ahead.</p><p>Concerns were also raised over the impact that the corporate headquarters would have on New York's already rising rents and overcrowded mass transit system. </p><p>This opposition eventually forced Amazon to withdraw its plans, reportedly over fears that the backlash was tarnishing its wider reputation.</p><p>In Toronto, concerns have been raised that any similar situation that could cause the Alphabet subsidiary to withdraw or be forced to abandon the Quayside project would blemish Canada's growing tech-friendly image.</p><p>'We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,' said Brian Kelcey, Toronto Region Board of Trade vice president of public affairs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53066983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2B-72V1-F021-62X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1373\"/><timeReceived>8:32 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Start-up groups said that \"overly broad\" requirements for digital businesses to stamp out harms such as trolling, as well as illegal activity, would sit heaviest on smaller companies, reducing their ability to compete, and benefiting companies such as Facebook and Google.</p><p>The proposals were published in a white paper on online harms. It has been described by the culture secretary as the world's first blueprint for regulat-ing the internet. It includes the introduction of an online regulator and large fines for companies that fail to tackle more than 20 harms, including terrorist and paedophile content and excessive screen time for children. The proposals are under consultation.</p><p>Dom Hallas, executive director of the Coalition for a Digital Economy, which represents British start-ups, said everyone shared the goal of a safer internet but the plans as outlined would \"entrench\" the technology giants that have been most criticised over online harms, not punish them.</p><p>\"Those most impacted will not be the tech giants the government claims it is targeting but everyone else,\" he said. \"It will benefit the largest platforms with the resources and legal might to comply and restrict the ability of British start-ups to compete fairly.\"</p><p>The Internet Association, which represents the big tech companies, said that its members were committed to ensuring online safety but needed proposals that were \"targeted and practical to implement\".</p><p>A Silicon Valley source agreed that the proposed regulations could be most restrictive to smaller companies seeking to compete in the market, saying: \"If you are talking about money, resources and legal teams to review stuff then yes, the larger platforms are always going to have more resources to deal with this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-148277826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW5-KD11-JCBW-N567-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock of London's Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p> Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p> Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p> The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p> Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p> One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p> \"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p> Critics point to data breaches at adult websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p> They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p> The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p> There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the United Kingdom. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and British internet service providers to block them.</p><p> Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p> Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th-most visited in the United Kingdom, according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics.</p><p> Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p> In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p> \"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p> Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p> \"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the British segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p> AgeID spokesman James Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p> \"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p> Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p> Kelvin Chan is an Associated Press writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-b19cccbe6ccb20c68dbd6e6f69645e22d1e7cc9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJW-5CG1-JBCN-41BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

These include individuals' understanding how their data is used, how Google and Facebook's algorithms may favour the content of their commercial partners, and commercial imbalances with Australian businesses, including media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Launching his response to the report, Mr Frydenberg said the ACCC report was \"truly a world first\", and the government would provide its final response by the end of the year.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, these companies are among the most powerful and valuable in the world. They need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>Google and Facebook dominate advertising markets globally. In Australia, excluding classifieds, Google services capture 47\u00a2 in every digital dollar spent, Facebook takes 24\u00a2, leaving 29\u00a2 to be spread between other advertising technology players and websites.</p><p>The inquiry has been closely watched around the world as it was the first to seek to tackle the negative impacts on other businesses, and broader society, of the rampant growth of online platforms.</p><p>The recommendations include a new unfair practices provision for Australian Consumer Law along similar lines to those in the US, UK and the EU and the creation of a new digital markets branch within the ACCC, which will act as an ombudsman for disputes with Google and Facebook.</p><p>This branch will tackle the controversial issue of policing the algorithms used by Google and Facebook to position news and advertising. They have been accused of using this to further their own commercial interests.</p><p>\"One of the purposes behind this new ACCC branch is to actually better understand the use of these algorithms to ensure that they're not being used for misleading or deceptive or anti-competitive conduct,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>\"This particular branch of the ACCC will be able to be approached by various companies who believe that the algorithms have been misused in that particular way and it is the ACCC itself which will focus on those algorithms and ensure they are used in a way that is compliant with the law.\"</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the oversight of algorithms will not give it access to Facebook and Google's source code.</p><p>\"We never intended that. This digital branch will be an active enforcer, it will be an active reporter to government of what's going on and it will also be people running experiments through the algorithms and having the information gathering powers to ask Google and Facebook, why this or this happening?\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"Whether those experiments are prompted by a complaint from someone, or the experiments we decide we need to run, that's exactly how we'll do it.\"</p><p>Media companies were particularly happy with the ACCC's recommendation to have digital platforms create a code of conduct for their business deals with media companies.</p><p>This would force Facebook and Google to share data and negotiate fair sharing of revenue generated from media companies' content.</p><p>\"This will provide another bow to our ability to be able to monetise the content creation we do and I can't underestimate how important that is as we look forward to the future,\" Nine chief executive Hugh Marks said.</p><p>The recommendations include changes to merger laws to prevent big tech companies hoovering up potential rivals; the removal of Google as the default search option on Android devices; an inquiry into the activities of advertising technology agencies and a new \"platform-neutral regulatory framework\" to ensure consistent regulatory oversight of all entities involved in content production or delivery in Australia.</p><p>That would open up the highly controversial possibility of Facebook, Google and Twitter being held legally responsible for the content published on their platforms.</p><p>Another related recommendation is the creation of a digital platforms code to counter disinformation or \"fake news\", to be governed by a regulator like ACMA.</p><p>This would be able to impose \"sufficiently large sanctions\" to act as an effective deterrent against code breaches.</p><p>\"Consumers have a right and reasonable expectation to know what they're getting is fair, balanced, accurate and reliable, and that does come from media businesses. I think the regulatory environment should ensure, as far as possible, that's the sort of content consumers are being given access to,\" Mr Marks said.</p><p>Facebook Australia managing director Will Easton said it is important to get rules for digital news distribution right.</p><p>\"They could impact the 16 million Australians who use our services to connect, share, and build community, as well as the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that use our free tools to grow, thrive, and create jobs,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are fully committed to engaging in the consultation process around this report.\"</p><p>The report also tackles the increasingly fraught issue of privacy in the digital age, it proposes to update the definition of \"personal information\" in the Privacy Act so that it captures technical data such as IP addresses, device identifiers, location data, and any other online identifiers that may be used identify an individual.</p><p>Importantly it will look to raise the bar in terms of tech providers notifying consumers about when their data has been collected, with an app or website required to clearly explain when personal data is being collected, and also obtain permission.</p><p>\"There is no option other than to put in place the right regulatory and legislative regime to protect the public's privacy.</p><p>\"The report finds is that so much personal data is being collected without informed consent,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>\"This report shines a very bright light on the use by Facebook and Google of people's personal data and the privacy regime and the other legislative and regulatory framework, parts of the framework, need to be updated to ensure that they are fit for purpose.\"</p><p>Under the report proposals an enforceable privacy code of practice will be introduced under the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which will cover all digital platforms supplying online search, social media, and content aggregation services to Australian consumers.</p><p>Companies could be fined for breaching privacy rules whichever is higher out of $10 million, three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information, or 10 per cent of a company's annual domestic turnover.</p><p>\"We're particularly concerned that consumers do not realise how much that their data is collected, and what is done with it. And when they do realise the evidence we have is largely by think the behaviour of the digital platforms in this regard is inappropriate,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>Seven West Media chief executive Tim Worner said there had been a lot of talk about the impact of big tech on the media industry, and he believed it was time to start making real changes.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that these digital platforms have too much power and must be held to account to make their activities more transparent.</p><p>\"Now we'd like to see a real focus to correct the regulatory disparity. Actually we'd like more than a focus, we'd like to see some action,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76dwz6ar5kg1csv73bix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-33M1-JD34-V566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1273\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Their arguments stood in contrast to the law's critics, who told lawmakers that the way the liability protections had been applied had enabled crimes and harassment across the web.</p><p>  Policymakers, angry about Silicon Valley's business practices, have increasingly focused on the provision, which makes it impossible to sue online platforms for certain claims, like defamation, over content posted by their users or for the way that they moderate user content. Critics argue that the decades-old law has made it hard to hold platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter accountable for misdeeds enabled by their technology.</p><p>  The debate over the law has come alongside a new push to regulate how those platforms use data and police information.</p><p>  As Section 230 is debated in Washington, however, American trade officials have pushed to include it in the United States Mexico Canada Agreement and a more limited trade deal reached with Japan last month. The effort to export American protections to trading partners comes amid a battle over who will get to set global internet rules. The European Union, for example, has more aggressively regulated Silicon Valley while China has led the way in walling off its internet from the rest of the world.</p><p>  Since August, Mr. Pallone and Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the committee's top Republican, have pressured Mr. Lighthizer to not include the Section 230-like language in the North American trade deal and the pact with Japan. Mr. Walden said Wednesday said that the high-ranking members were ''frustrated'' with the administration.</p><p>  ''The 230-like language has no place in a trade agreement,'' said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. ''This is a gift to Big Tech to insert it in trade agreements.''</p><p>  Trade officials say that it is their job to help spread United States law around the world and that if Congress does not like those laws, it is their job to change them. The provision's supporters say that its inclusion in trade deals will not make it harder to alter the law down the road.</p><p>  ''There's no language in the trade deal that binds Congress's hands,'' Katherine Oyama, Google's global head of intellectual property policy, told lawmakers. She noted that trade accords frequently include intellectual property protections even though lawmakers regularly debate copyright and patent reforms.</p><p>  Despite the debate, few lawmakers have introduced legislation to change Section 230. Only one tweak has become law, a controversial measure making it possible to sue platforms when they knowingly facilitate sex-trafficking through content they host. Some lawmakers have questioned whether a similar change should be made to combat the online opioid trade.</p><p>  On Wednesday, the House lawmakers seemed to have little appetite to throw the rules out entirely. But they were open to changing them.</p><p>  ''I want to be very clear: I'm not for gutting Section 230,'' said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington. ''But at the same time, it's clear we've reached a point where it is incumbent upon us as policymakers to have a serious and thoughtful discussion about achieving the balance on Section 230.''</p><p>  Internet companies and their allies say that changes to the law will imperil their business models, especially for smaller firms with fewer resources, and endanger free speech online.</p><p>  ''It's important to understand that rather than helping, even narrow changes to 230 can undermine the power of community and hurt the vulnerable,'' said Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit.</p><p>  For instance, he said that if lawmakers were to create an exemption covering opioid related content, it could become ''too risky'' for his site to host forums for ''users struggling with addiction.''</p><p>  ''This would be a disservice to people who are struggling, yet this is exactly the type of decision that restrictions on 230 would force on us,'' he said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey criticized the Trump administration for including legal protections for digital platforms in recent trade deals.

In 2017, more than half of Europeans shifted to digital forms of banking. The emergence of Covid-19 has only served to accelerate this mass movement, with lack of access to bank branches, ATM closures and card-only payment options,just a few of the motivators. And as more and more people grow comfortable with the idea and practicalities of digital banking \u2013 or are driven to it out of necessity \u2013 it\u2019s reasonable to assume that remote account openings, deposits, loans, credit card applications and day-to-day transactions will only increase.   For the likes ofRevolut, Starling and their ilk this is good news. Smaller, more agile and not reliant on legacy technology, they are already streets ahead in terms of onboarding and service speed. They\u2019re also plugging in more and more third party services with relevance to their customers\u2019 needs, making them even more attractive to consumers looking for a better way to manage their money and payments.   In response, legacy banks \u2013 slow to digitise in response to the threat from challengers \u2013 are turning to Big Tech and a model that makes good business sense for both parties.   Put simply, a platform is a kind of business model that facilitates transactions between large networks of users such as sellers and buyers, drivers and riders, hosts and guests.   Amazon, Uber and Airbnb are obvious examples of platforms.   The core strength of platforms can be distilled into two main characteristics.First, they are organised around the user experienceand meeting their needs by coordinating and integrating products and services from an ecosystem of producers. Second, platforms significantly minimise users\u2019 transaction costs. This comes in part from indirect network effects as the platform achieves scalebut also from the use of data in insightful, efficient ways.   For incumbent banks, platforms offer the ability to better fulfil requirements for new and existing customers, while offering more services they\u2019ve been unable to realise traditionally. It also allows banks to capitalise on the huge amounts of long-term customer data they\u2019re currently sitting on. And for organisations not known for operating cutting edge systems, partnering with Big Tech means access to the latest tech without major investments in time and money.   Access to data is, not surprisingly, also a major attraction for Big Tech in teaming up with incumbent banks. Access to a banking partner\u2019s customer data \u2013 from buying habits toactive loansand insurance products\u2013 allows them to add huge value to their existing services as well as open up opportunities to partners. And this is value they can obtain without getting bogged down in the regulatory quagmire that comes with setting up a bank of their own.   With recent partnership announcements from Google, we\u2019re seeing just how quickly platform banking is taking off.   At the beginning of August, the company announced it was partnering with six more US banks \u2013 in addition to existing partners Citi and SFCU \u2013 to offer digital checking and savings accounts to users of its Google Pay service; including, BBVA, BMO Harris, Bank Mobile, Coastal Community Bank, First Independence and SEFCU.   While the banks will operate the accounts, Google will handle the front-end experience and offer financial insights and budgeting tools (for starters).   Similarly we see Microsoft also very successfully diversifying away from a pure licence model into more enterprise services which will allow banks to leverage not only its workplace modernising tools like Office 365 but also its enterprise platforms like Azure, Dynamics and Teams to accelerate transformation. Its recent announcements of the Microsof Cloud for Healthcare and its partnership with Mastercard shows how this platform model can work to help banks and other FS institutions.   Other members of the GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) collective \u2013 Amazon and Facebook \u2013 have also been making news with their explorations into the financial space. And while both have faced setbacks \u2013 Amazon recently reneged on its intention to provide checking accounts through JP Morgan, while Facebook has revised its Libra cryptocurrency plans \u2013 it can\u2019t be too long before these innovators return with fresh offerings.   So it seems the digital wave that threatened to make banks redundant is actually proving to be a boon for the industry. Access to new customers, new offerings and the very latest technology, without considerable investment, recruitment and training is giving incumbent organisations a new lease on life.   It also provides us with a glimpse of their potential future \u2013 seamlessly blending into existing customer offerings, an unseen layer focusing on its core historical strengths, empowering people to do more with their money. Or perhaps this chapter will convince banks to become something else entirely. Making use of the vast amounts of customer data, collected over years of association and across multiple touchpoints to engage with customers in new ways to the benefit of both parties.   The one thing we can be sure of when it comes to the marriage between Big Tech and Big Banks \u2013 this is just the beginning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42957152675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PX-H6M1-JCSC-J4VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Financial IT</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 30, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Legacy Technology Holdings Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reach New Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>LTHO</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>08471</className><className>HKG</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0UyODlCRjcwOUUyNDQ4RThEQ0ZGQTM0NUYzOTgyRUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBODUyMzhBNzc4NDZDNEE4RjRCRUQ2QzJDMDg2QjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Add to this the competitive advantage that their user data gives them and we can expect the next 20 years to be far less innovative than the last.\u201d<br/> The concentration of power in the hands of a few mega platforms is also the source of the current fake news crisis, in Berners-Lee\u2019s view, because he says platform power has made it possible for people to \u201cweaponise the web at scale\u201d \u2014 echoing comments made by the UK prime minister last year when she called out Russia for planting fakes online to try to disrupt elections.<br/> \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and criminals steal troves of personal data,\u201d he writes, pointing out that the current response of lawmakers has been to look \u201cto the platforms themselves for answers\u201d \u2014 which he argues is neither fair nor likely to be effective.<br/> In the EU, for example, the threat of future regulation is being used to encourage social media companies to sign up to a voluntary code of conduct aimed at speeding up takedowns of various types of illegal content, including terrorist propaganda. Though the Commission is also seeking to drive action against a much broader set of online content issues \u2014 such as hate speech, commercial scams and even copyrighted material.<br/> Critics argue its approach risks chilling free expression via AI-powered censorship.<br/> Some EU member states have gone further too. Germany now has a law with big fines for social media platforms that fail to comply with hate speech takedown requirements, for example, while in the UK ministers are toying with new rules, such as placing limits on screen time for children and teens.<br/> Both the Commission and some EU member states have been pushing for increased automation of content moderation online. In the UK last month, ministers unveiled an extremism blocking tool which the government had paid a local AI company to develop, with the Home Secretary warning she had not ruled out forcing companies to use it.<br/> Meanwhile, in the US, Facebook has faced huge pressure in recent years as awareness has grown of how extensively its platform is used to spread false information, including during the 2016 presidential election.<br/> The company has announced a series of measures aimed at combating the spread of fake news generally, and reducing the risk of election disinformation specifically \u2014 as well as a major recent change to its news feed algorithm ostensibly to encourage users towards having more positive interactions on its platform.<br/> But Berners-Lee argues that letting commercial entities pull levers to try to fix such a wide-ranging problem is a bad idea \u2014 arguing that any fixes companies come up with will inexorably be restrained by their profit-maximizing context and also that they amount to another unilateral impact on users.<br/> A better solution, in his view, is not to let tech platform giants self-regulate but to create a framework for ruling them that factors in \u201csocial objectives\u201d.<br/> A year ago Berners-Lee also warned about the same core threats to the web. Though he was less coherent in his thinking then that regulation could be the solution \u2014 instead flagging up a variety of initiatives aimed at trying to combat threats such as the systematic background harvesting of personal data. So he seems to be shifting towards the need for a move overarching framework to control the tech that\u2019s being used to control us.<br/> \u201cCompanies are aware of the problems and are making efforts to fix them \u2014 with each change they make affecting millions of people,\u201d he writes now. \u201cThe responsibility \u2014 and sometimes burden \u2014 of making these decisions falls on companies that have been built to maximise profit more than to maximise social good. A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those tensions.\u201d<br/> Berners-Lee\u2019s letter also emphasizes the need for diversity of thought in shaping any web regulations to ensure rules don\u2019t get skewed towards a certain interest or group. And he makes a strong call for investments to help close the global digital divide.<br/> \u201cThe future of the web isn\u2019t just about those of us who are online today, but also those yet to connect,\u201d he warns. \u201cToday\u2019s powerful digital economy calls for strong standards that balance the interests of both companies and online citizens. This means thinking about how we align the incentives of the tech sector with those of users and society at large, and consulting a diverse cross-section of society in the process.\u201d<br/> Another specific call he makes is for fresh thinking about Internet business models, arguing that online advertising should not be accepted as the only possible route for sustaining web platforms. \u201cWe need to be a little more creative,\u201d he argues.<br/> \u201cWhile the problems facing the web are complex and large, I think we should see them as bugs: problems with existing code and software systems that have been created by people \u2014 and can be fixed by people.

For multinational companies with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-q2-earnings-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">billions</url> of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/technology/alphabet-google-earnings-coronavirus.html\">dollars</url> in revenue each quarter, paying for Australian news would be small potatoes. </p><p>But their more pressing concern may be that whatever happens in Australia could set a precedent for other countries. Other nations are holding inquiries on how best to regulate big tech platforms, and they are watching developments in Australia very closely.</p><h>Platforms and the plight of news</h><p>These inquiries address a range of issues, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/final-report-high-level-expert-group-fake-news-and-online-disinformation\">disinformation</url> to <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=14921\">antitrust </url>. But some have specifically examined the relationship between platforms and news publishers. These include Canada's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/110.nsf/eng/home\">Broadcasting and Telecommunications Review</url> and the United Kingdom's <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779882/021919_DCMS_Cairncross_Review_.pdf\">Cairncross Review</url>. </p><p>Both reviews call for new regulations to manage the relationship between platforms and news publishers. The UK specifically mentions a code of conduct. The Canadian inquiry discusses the possibility of a code but also suggests that online platforms could pay money into a fund to support Canadian content (including news).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: 'Suck it and see' or face a digital tax, former ACCC boss Allan Fels warns Google and Facebook</emphasis></p><p>However, neither government has yet taken up these reforms. One reason for the delay in the UK is that the government there has a busy policy agenda around digital platforms, and is waiting for recommendations from multiple reviews before introducing major regulatory reform. </p><p>The second reason is that the UK and Canada are watching and waiting to see what happens in Australia.       </p><h>Similar countries may adopt similar rules</h><p>Watching Australia makes sense. Canada and the UK have similar <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparing_Media_Systems\">media systems</url> to Australia. All three countries also share a common law heritage and often turn to each other for policy ideas. </p><p>As a result, it would be relatively easy for these countries to translate aspects of the ACCC's draft bargaining code to their own codes of conduct. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Google's 'open letter' is trying to scare Australians. The company simply doesn't want to pay for news</emphasis></p><p>Canada is already being influenced by the Australian reform process. The country been quite active on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2020/09/04/bill-morneaus-pitch-for-the-oecds-top-job-hell-take-on-big-tech.html\">international stage</url> and has tried to establish global cooperation around platform regulation through its participation in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cigionline.org/igc\">International Grand Committee</url>. The Committee has brought together  legislators from around the world who are working together to establish baseline regulatory principles for the internet and share policy solutions.</p><p>However, Canada is starting to move away from these international discussions and  consider national solutions. Canada's heritage minister Steven Guilbeault recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://financialpost.com/telecom/media/those-who-use-media-content-should-pay-fair-share-heritage-minister\">called on platforms to pay for news content</url>, which suggests Australian developments might be <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/ottawa-likely-to-face-pressure-from-google-facebook-on-news-sharing-rules-following-threats-against-australia\">informing</url> Canada's regulatory response. </p><h>Europe is already pushing Google to pay</h><p>Another problem for platforms is that countries without a shared legal heritage with Australia are also pursuing similar reforms. France is the most notable example: in April its competition authority ordered Google to <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/\">pay publishers for news</url>. </p><p>The decision essentially forced Google to engage in a bargaining process like the one proposed in Australia. However, Google has been accused of not bargaining in good faith, and French publishers are returning to the regulators to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usine-digitale.fr/editorial/les-medias-francais-intensifient-leur-bataille-contre-google-sur-la-remuneration-des-contenus.N999809\">reset the negotiations</url>. </p><p>French publishers have also tried to streamline the process by joining with their German colleagues with the goal of establishing a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/economie/les-editeurs-francais-et-allemands-s-allient-face-aux-geants-du-numerique-6923136\">one-stop shop</url> for bargaining.     </p><h>An international approach</h><p>This combination of active reforms and dormant inquiries helps to explain why Google and Facebook have reacted so dramatically. Australia is engaging in a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/accc-s-sims-hopes-to-set-global-precedent-on-google-and-facebook-20181210-p50lby.html\">world first</url>\" regulatory endeavour. However, it is important to remember that Australia is not the only country considering reforms, they are just the first to implement them. The big question is whether other countries are influenced by the Australian response. </p><p>The threat of a consistent international approach that would see Google and Facebook pay for news in multiple countries is what has brought the platforms onto the front foot, engaging in a dedicated public relations exercise. The cost of paying for news globally has not been accounted for in their business models, and it's an expense they are not keen to wear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: It's not 'fair' and it won't work: an argument against the ACCC forcing Google and Facebook to pay for news</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Meese receives funding from the Australian Research Council.

Rather than agree to negotiate with media companies to pay for using news content...</p><p>Google and Facebook have launched a nationwide public relations campaign in response to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission\u2019s draft news media bargaining code.    Rather than agree to negotiate with media companies to pay for using news content, Google has launched petitions and written an open letter complaining of the \u201crisk\u201d to its services , while Facebook has threatened to stop distributing news on its platform .    At first glance, these responses might look like overreactions. For multinational companies with billions of dollars in revenue each quarter, paying for Australian news would be small potatoes.    But their more pressing concern may be that whatever happens in Australia could set a precedent for other countries. Other nations are holding inquiries on how best to regulate big tech platforms, and they are watching developments in Australia very closely.   Platforms and the plight of news   These inquiries address a range of issues, from disinformation to antitrust . But some have specifically examined the relationship between platforms and news publishers. These include Canada\u2019s Broadcasting and Telecommunications Review and the United Kingdom\u2019s Cairncross Review .    Both reviews call for new regulations to manage the relationship between platforms and news publishers. The UK specifically mentions a code of conduct. The Canadian inquiry discusses the possibility of a code but also suggests that online platforms could pay money into a fund to support Canadian content (including news).      However, neither government has yet taken up these reforms. One reason for the delay in the UK is that the government there has a busy policy agenda around digital platforms, and is waiting for recommendations from multiple reviews before introducing major regulatory reform.    The second reason is that the UK and Canada are watching and waiting to see what happens in Australia.   Similar countries may adopt similar rules   Watching Australia makes sense. Canada and the UK have similar media systems to Australia. All three countries also share a common law heritage and often turn to each other for policy ideas.    As a result, it would be relatively easy for these countries to translate aspects of the ACCC\u2019s draft bargaining code to their own codes of conduct.      Canada is already being influenced by the Australian reform process. The country been quite active on the international stage and has tried to establish global cooperation around platform regulation through its participation in the International Grand Committee . The Committee has brought together  legislators from around the world who are working together to establish baseline regulatory principles for the internet and share policy solutions.    However, Canada is starting to move away from these international discussions and  consider national solutions. Canada\u2019s heritage minister Steven Guilbeault recently called on platforms to pay for news content , which suggests Australian developments might be informing Canada\u2019s regulatory response.        Europe is already pushing Google to pay   Another problem for platforms is that countries without a shared legal heritage with Australia are also pursuing similar reforms. France is the most notable example: in April its competition authority ordered Google to pay publishers for news .    The decision essentially forced Google to engage in a bargaining process like the one proposed in Australia. However, Google has been accused of not bargaining in good faith, and French publishers are returning to the regulators to reset the negotiations .    French publishers have also tried to streamline the process by joining with their German colleagues with the goal of establishing a one-stop shop for bargaining.   An international approach   This combination of active reforms and dormant inquiries helps to explain why Google and Facebook have reacted so dramatically. Australia is engaging in a \u201c world first \u201d regulatory endeavour. However, it is important to remember that Australia is not the only country considering reforms, they are just the first to implement them. The big question is whether other countries are influenced by the Australian response.    The threat of a consistent international approach that would see Google and Facebook pay for news in multiple countries is what has brought the platforms onto the front foot, engaging in a dedicated public relations exercise. The cost of paying for news globally has not been accounted for in their business models, and it\u2019s an expense they are not keen to wear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43040697463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T6-WPY1-JCSC-J2XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Conversation AU</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Even before that, 70-80 proposals for regulating platforms were under consideration globally, Hogan Lovells preliminarily found in an ongoing six-month survey. Early results show \"by far the most proposals we tracked come from the government,\" emailed Hogan Lovells (Brussels) competition lawyer Falk Schoening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That governments, not industry, are making such proposals suggests they might see the light of day, Schoening added. He noted platforms acted quickly after the Christchurch crime to take down the video of the attacks on two mosques, which shows there's \"an emerging form of self-regulation in the industry.\" Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter didn't comment Monday.</p><p>EU countries seem most active in seeking to regulate platforms, but such activities are also taking place elsewhere, including China and Japan, Schoening said in an interview. Preliminary conclusions show a \"perceived need\" for politicians to act, to tell voters in the upcoming EU and national elections how they'll protect them from abuse by platforms. Whether the rules will actually safeguard people against tech companies is questionable, he said; the overarching theme is how to get platform regulation right internationally. One key question is who has power to regulate -- telecom authorities or competition agencies, Schoening said. Competition law figures in 25 percent of the proposals, possibly because of their perceived successful use against tech players by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>U.K. lawmakers are increasingly focused on platform regulation. A yearlong probe into disinformation and fake news found democracy is threatened by relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalized \"dark adverts\" from unidentifiable sources delivered over major social media platforms, said Member of Parliament Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.\" He was among those who attacked Facebook for not sending CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a November multicountry privacy hearing held by Collins' committee (see 1811270014).</p><p>\"Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform' and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites,\" the Feb. 18 committee report said. It urged creating a new category of tech company, not necessarily a \"platform\" or \"publisher,\" which would assume legal liability for content identified as harmful after it's posted by users. The panel urged governments to impose a code of ethics, overseen by an independent regulator, setting out what constitutes harmful content. \"Reliance on voluntary codes, such as the one at EU level on Disinformation, is no longer an option,\" said European Publishers Council Executive Director Angela Mills Wade in a statement.</p><p>The EU e-commerce directive, which exempts platforms from liability unless they have specific knowledge of illegal content, was enacted before those companies began to curate content for users, the U.K. Lords Communications Committee reported March 9. \"Self-regulation by online platforms which host user-generated content, including social media platforms, is failing.\" The panel recommended platforms hosting user content be subject to a statutory duty of care, enforced by the Office of Communications, and that a new body, the Digital Authority, coordinate regulators. The report supports his organization's \"longstanding view\" that the internet is subject to the same laws that apply offline, said ISP Association Chair Andrew Glover in a statement.</p><p>\"Consider the areas for -- and the scope and form of -- regulation of digital platforms operating in Australia,\" the Communications and Media Authority told a Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry. It proposed a \"stack\" regulatory model with rules, when needed, targeted across each layer rather than particular delivery modes.</p><p>Meaningful regulation in the U.S. is unlikely, except possibly on privacy or political campaign funding, said Greg Sparrow, CompliancePoint senior vice president. The debate is complicated by free speech concerns, which make it hard to pin rules on content, and which mean any regulation will probably be about fair disclosure. Regulating platforms is a \"hard challenge\" because it comes down to each country's respective cultural values, the consultant said: In the U.S., it's more a brand issue for tech companies seeking customer goodwill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNR-9R31-DYRJ-007P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0005CZ7</classCode><className>HOGAN LOVELLS US LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon's shock $US13.7 billion ($18.1 billion) offer to buy upscale organic grocer Whole Foods Market underlines how America's technology giants are extending their reach across the economy to cement themselves as the most powerful forces in modern capitalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a tectonic shift that's disrupting business and benefiting consumers, the cashed-up Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google's parent Alphabet, and Microsoft are making big bets in markets traditionally outside the realms of technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ambitious billionaire bosses such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are targeting a bigger share of consumer wallets and aiming to connect with billions of consumers worldwide.</p><p>No industry seems safe to disruption. Big tech is applying expertise in software and data to diversify into retail, automobile-making via driverless cars, banking, media, online videos, healthcare solutions and drones, to name just a few.</p><p>Darrel West, founding director of the Centre for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution (a think tank), says: \"We are headed for a few big players with companies with software tools allowing them to be strong in a variety of different sectors.\"</p><p>Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are the world's most valuable public companies by market capitalisation. Facebook is in the top 10 and is an advertising revenue juggernaut.</p><p>Combined, these five titans are worth almost $US3 trillion ($3.9 trillion), more than double the size of the Australian economy.</p><p>Chetan Sharma, a Seattle-based mobile and data consultant, says these giants will continue to push cloud computing, consumer analytics and artificial intelligence into new areas.</p><p>The business and technology convergence has triggered grumblings from sceptics, who worry such leviathans could wipe out traditional businesses, turn into anti-competitive oligopolies and destroy jobs, as automation replaces workers at the supermarket checkout, driving cars and conducting health scans.</p><p>\"Amazon eats the world,\" boomed one headline this week. \"Tech's 'Frightful 5\" was how The New York Times recently characterised the trend.</p><p>Some observers, such as Harvard Business School digital academic Jeffrey Rayport, argue platform companies have become \"winner takes all\" in their markets and increasingly look like monopolies.</p><p>Google controls about 90 per cent of the internet search market in Australia and Europe. Amazon, which has decimated bookstores and is hurting shopping malls, is easily America's biggest online retailer. Facebook dominates social media. Apple sold 78 million smartphones last year.</p><p>US President Donald Trump threatened during last year's election to \"go after\" Amazon's billionaire founder Bezos for anti-competitive practices.</p><p>\"Because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump seemed motivated by the hardline reporting by The Washington Post, which Bezos also owns.</p><p>Yet when Trump this week hosted Bezos and top tech executives including Apple chief Tim Cook, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella, IBM head Ginni Rometty and Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt (Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg declined the White House invitation), there was little talk about anti-competitive issues and more focus on how big tech could make government more efficient and create well-paying jobs.</p><p>Trump might have been influenced by his outside tech adviser, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who writes in his top-selling book Zero to One \"there is no reason technology should be limited to computers\".</p><p>\"Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator,\" Thiel notes.</p><p>Still, the European Union is pursuing Google for alleged anti-competitive practices in Europe and there is a growing chorus calling for similar reviews in other markets.</p><p>Tech's dominance is indisputable as they leverage off the \"network effect\" of cutting across various industries.</p><p>However, the evidence on any monopoly domination, at least to date, suggests concerns are overblown.</p><p>\"It is arguably a more fragile dominance than 20 years ago,\" says Joshua Meltzer, an Australian expat and senior fellow who focuses on digital trade issues at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</p><p>The tech industry is not only highly disruptive against non-tech players, but former internet high flyers have also fallen victim to the creative destruction.</p><p>Myspace, an early social media network, was obliterated by Facebook. Yahoo! dominated the internet search market in the 1990s before Google took over. Yahoo! has spectacularly unravelled and was recently acquired by Verizon Communications for $US5.5 billion, a shadow of the near $US140 billion peak in the dotcom bubble era in 2000.</p><p>Fellow internet pioneer America Online (AOL), the software services company that allowed computer users to access the internet community, suffered a similar fate after broadband destroyed its dial-up internet access model.</p><p>And as Thiel notes, just when the US government moved to regulate IBM as a monopoly due to its dominance in desktop computers and software, Microsoft and Intel emerged as the disrupters.</p><p>Eric Goldman, a Silicon Valley lawyer turned director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, says the competitive environment in the internet industry changes rapidly so it's dangerous for governments to intervene.</p><p>\"It remains to be seen if that diversification succeeds, let alone if they get monopoly power.\"</p><p>Furthermore, giant and dominant companies have always been a ubiquitous feature of the US market economy.</p><p>The so-called industrialist \"robber barons\" of the late 19th century, such as railway operators, oil barons including the Rockefellers and Wall Street financiers, had outsized influence on the economy, policy and politics.</p><p>Australia, partly due to its small population, is dominated by oligopolies in banking, supermarkets and airlines. In the US, the once-dominant retail department chain Sears owned and sold almost everything, including Allstate insurance, clothing, car rentals, bicycles, tools, music records, electrical goods and farm machinery, to just name a few business lines.</p><p>In a twist of irony, Sears recently announced the closure of 150 stores. Struggling to stay afloat, its share price has crashed to below $US7 from a peak of $US192 a decade ago. The reason? Amazon's online sales model is decimating shopping malls.</p><p>Certainly, Amazon is turning into a sprawling conglomerate across e-commerce, cloud computing, online subscription television, small business loans, artificial intelligence and in-house devices.</p><p>Yet the idea Amazon epitomises the so-called \"winner takes all\" economy appears overstated.</p><p>Jeremy Philips, a New York-based Spark Capital Growth partner who invests in tech start-ups, says in many categories the largest tech companies compete vigorously against each other, such as online music and videos.</p><p>In areas such as driverless cars and drone deliveries, \"there are certainly no winners yet and it is not clear that there are scale or network effects in operation that will lead to that\", says Joshua Gans, chair in technical innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto.</p><p>In the future, however, it is possible this time will be different and the tech giants may become too powerful.</p><p>Competitors and regulators will need to be wary if the valuable big data that digital companies control concentrates too much power in too few hands and blocks the emergence of competitors.</p><p>The databases and algorithms that Amazon, Google and Facebook control from internet searches and clicks may prove incredibly valuable and necessary for success.</p><p>That gives these powerhouses an advantage in gleaning insights into people's behaviour, consumer preferences and personal characteristics.</p><p>In theory, competitors might be able to access this data, but the expense of building such huge databases could become prohibitive.</p><p>Spark Capital's Phillips acknowledges the ground might be being laid for future monopolies, but argues the five big tech companies are competing \"vigorously\" on data so consumers are not under threat any time soon.</p><p>\"Data may make it harder for new entrants to compete, but people tend to systematically underestimate the level of technological and business model innovation,\" Phillips says.</p><p>He adds: \"Time will tell, but right now all of this competition makes it a great time to be a consumer.\"</p><p>Regardless, Sharma says the regulatory regimes are completely unprepared to deal with this new reality. \"They can evaluate Google under the 'advertising' umbrella but have no way to understand the implications of their massive artificial intelligence engine applied to new areas like autonomous vehicles, commerce and connectivity,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6vhuzgokrdikbora2iq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NVP-7K01-JD34-V4CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The CEO, he says, \"told me in no uncertain terms, If you talk to my competitors, you are no longer welcome here.'\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banker, in fact, had not only talked to a competitor, he had a strong relationship with one. And given the warning, he decided to drop the new prospect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Effectively, you have to pick your horse,\" the banker says.</p><p>Good advice, but not always taken in the real world of banking/client relationships, not by a long shot. For example, the recent lawsuit filed by Dana Corp. against UBS, its former banker, shows that despite the recent regulatory crackdown on Wall Street, banks still-if the charges are borne out-play both sides of the fence.</p><p>Dana alleges that UBS, which had been a lender as well as an adviser to the auto parts maker, used confidential information to help rival ArvinMeritor Inc. launch a $2.2 billion hostile bid for Dana last month. Worse, it claims that UBS was still advising Dana on a confidential project at the very time it was helping Arvin launch the unwanted bid. From early June, when Arvin quietly propositioned Dana, to July 8, when the bid became public, the suit alleges, UBS was on both sides, disclosing its ArvinMeritor tie to Dana only on July 8, when it also offered to resign.</p><p>UBS didn't return calls for comment. Dana declined to comment. An ArvinMeritor spokesman says: \"UBS has assured us that they have gone through the appropriate compliance procedures and that there is no issue.\"</p><p>Conflicts like the one Dana alleges weren't addressed in the $1.4 billion Wall Street settlement in April over tainted research. But some observers contend those conflicts have only grown in type and number since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 2000, which lifted the last restraints preventing commercial banks from providing a full array of investment banking services. Now, big universal banks can collect sensitive data on a client as a lender at the same time their investment bankers are working on a deal that affects that same client-as Dana alleges in its suit. Conflicts, of course, are also a minefield for traditional investment banks, which may switch sides in a hostile deal, or may have individual bankers covering bitter rivals at the same time.</p><p>\"It is very opportunistic on the part of the investment banks, and it is the reason why corporations and investment banks need to keep a real distance from each other,\" says Professor Samuel Hayes, the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking Emeritus at Harvard Business School. \"Neither one is willing to make a long-term commitment.\"</p><p>On the client side, companies in search of best terms often play the switching game. \"Companies' attitude is, What have you done for me lately,'\" says Hayes. \"They are always willing to take a look at somebody else's product or service.\"</p><p>On the bank side, \"that's the problem with these financial supermarkets,\" says a senior M&amp;A banker who worked at a universal bank. \"They want to have a relationship with everybody. Of course they have conflicts. The question is: Do they manage them well or not?\"</p><p>Managing conflicts</p><p>Some conflicts arise from bankers working closely together in one group. Bankers in universal banks are grouped by industry these days and are no longer separated into commercial and investment bankers. \"UBS has a small automotive group working in one office,\" said one person familiar with its banking structure. \"How difficult is it for confidential information to make its way from one banker to another?\"</p><p>Overall, banks do try to manage these conflicts. \"Banks protect the information by putting up Chinese walls and keeping the teams separate,\" says Malcolm Ross, an M&amp;A partner with Kronish Lieb Weiner &amp; Hellman LLP. Many conduct a \"conflict check\" on new accounts, says a senior M&amp;A banker. In a hostile situation, the conflict check is more thorough, and tries to list all potential problems.</p><p>\"It is not fair to clients to have the same banker be engaged by head to head competitors, says Sam Schwartz, a partner at the boutique investment bank of Bryant Park Capital.</p><p>Traditional investment banks and specialized advisory boutiques like the Blackstone Group and Lazard LLC, which don't lend, have their own problem-which some call \"competitive conflict.\"</p><p>Several bankers cite Lazard, in particular, in the swashbuckling days of the late 1980s and early 1990s as being prone to jumping sides, especially for media/entertainment deals. That made it tough on CEOs, who had to weigh Lazard's deep industry knowledge and understanding of competitors with the risk that it might decamp for a rival at any time.</p><p>Lazard says its posture is much different these days.

The CEO, he says, \"told me in no uncertain terms, If you talk to my competitors, you are no longer welcome here.'\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banker, in fact, had not only talked to a competitor, he had a strong relationship with one. And given the warning, he decided to drop the new prospect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Effectively, you have to pick your horse,\" the banker says.</p><p>Good advice, but not always taken in the real world of banking/client relationships, not by a long shot. For example, the recent lawsuit filed by Dana Corp.against UBS, its former banker, shows that despite the recent regulatory crackdown on Wall Street, banks still-if the charges are borne out-play both sides of the fence.</p><p>Dana alleges that UBS, which had been a lender as well as an adviser to the auto parts maker, used confidential information to help rival ArvinMeritor Inc.launch a $2.2 billion hostile bid for Dana last month. Worse, it claims that UBS was still advising Dana on a confidential project at the very time it was helping Arvin launch the unwanted bid. From early June, when Arvin quietly propositioned Dana, to July 8, when the bid became public, the suit alleges, UBS was on both sides, disclosing its ArvinMeritortie to Dana only on July 8, when it also offered to resign.</p><p>UBS didn't return calls for comment. Dana declined to comment. An ArvinMeritor spokesman says: \"UBS has assured us that they have gone through the appropriate compliance procedures and that there is no issue.\"</p><p>Conflicts like the one Dana alleges weren't addressed in the $1.4 billion Wall Street settlement in April over tainted research. But some observers contend those conflicts have only grown in type and number since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 2000, which lifted the last restraints preventing commercial banks from providing a full array of investment banking services. Now, big universal banks can collect sensitive data on a client as a lender at the same time their investment bankers are working on a deal that affects that same client-as Dana alleges in its suit. Conflicts, of course, are also a minefield for traditional investment banks, which may switch sides in a hostile deal, or may have individual bankers covering bitter rivals at the same time.</p><p>\"It is very opportunistic on the part of the investment banks, and it is the reason why corporations and investment banks need to keep a real distance from each other,\" says Professor Samuel Hayes, the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking Emeritus at Harvard Business School. \"Neither one is willing to make a long-term commitment.\"</p><p>On the client side, companies in search of best terms often play the switching game. \"Companies' attitude is, What have you done for me lately,'\" says Hayes. \"They are always willing to take a look at somebody else's product or service.\"</p><p>On the bank side, \"that's the problem with these financial supermarkets,\" says a senior M&amp;A bankerwho worked at a universal bank. \"They want to have a relationship with everybody. Of course they have conflicts. The question is: Do they manage them well or not?\"</p><p>Managing conflicts</p><p>Some conflicts arise from bankers working closely together in one group. Bankers in universal banks are grouped by industry these days and are no longer separated into commercial and investment bankers. \"UBS has a small automotive group working in one office,\" said one person familiar with its banking structure. \"How difficult is it for confidential information to make its way from one banker to another?\"</p><p>Overall, banks do try to manage these conflicts. \"Banks protect the information by putting up Chinese walls and keeping the teams separate,\" says Malcolm Ross, an M&amp;A partner with Kronish Lieb Weiner &amp; Hellman LLP. Many conduct a \"conflict check\" on new accounts, says a senior M&amp;A banker. In a hostile situation, the conflict check is more thorough, and tries to list all potential problems.</p><p>\"It is not fair to clients to have the same banker be engaged by head to head competitors, says Sam Schwartz, a partner at the boutique investment bank of Bryant Park Capital.</p><p>Traditional investment banks and specialized advisory boutiques like the Blackstone Group and Lazard LLC, which don't lend, have their own problem-which some call \"competitive conflict.\"</p><p>Several bankers cite Lazard, in particular, in the swashbuckling days of the late 1980s and early 1990s as being prone to jumping sides, especially for media/entertainment deals. That made it tough on CEOs, who had to weigh Lazard's deep industry knowledge and understanding of competitors with the risk that it might decamp for a rival at any time.</p><p>Lazard says its posture is much different these days. Says Kenneth Jacobs, deputy chairman and the head of LazardU.S.: \"While clients often hire bankers for their balance sheet or industry expertise, ultimately to establish a trusted relationship the client and banker must be sure their interests are aligned.\"</p><p>The size of Blackstone's banking team is small enough to be beneficial in managing conflicts. Blackstone Vice Chairman Hamilton James says the firm limits the hiring of additional bankers who might create client conflicts. In the case of broad sectors like financial services, it may assign several senior bankers, but each focuses on a different aspect, like insurance and asset management.</p><p>\"We tend to focus on a few key relationships in any given sector,\" says James. \"If it so happens that the company has more than one key relationship in an industry, we assure our clients that their banking team is devoted to them and is not calling on their direct competitors.\"</p><p>Merits of a case</p><p>There is no law against switching sides, so to determine the merit of a lawsuit such as Dana's, the courts look at case law, says an attorney with a major law firm that specializes in takeovers.

The CEO, he says, \"told me in no uncertain terms, If you talk to my competitors, you are no longer welcome here.'\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banker, in fact, had not only talked to a competitor, he had a strong relationship with one. And given the warning, he decided to drop the new prospect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Effectively, you have to pick your horse,\" the banker says.</p><p>Good advice, but not always taken in the real world of banking/client relationships, not by a long shot. For example, the recent lawsuit filed by Dana Corp.against UBS, its former banker, shows that despite the recent regulatory crackdown on Wall Street, banks still-if the charges are borne out-play both sides of the fence.</p><p>Dana alleges that UBS, which had been a lender as well as an adviser to the auto parts maker, used confidential information to help rival ArvinMeritor Inc. launch a $2.2 billion hostile bid for Dana last month. Worse, it claims that UBS was still advising Dana on a confidential project at the very time it was helping Arvin launch the unwanted bid. From early June, when Arvin quietly propositioned Dana, to July 8, when the bid became public, the suit alleges, UBS was on both sides, disclosing its ArvinMeritor tie to Dana only on July 8, when it also offered to resign.</p><p>UBS didn't return calls for comment. Dana declined to comment. An ArvinMeritor spokesman says: \"UBS has assured us that they have gone through the appropriate compliance procedures and that there is no issue.\"</p><p>Conflicts like the one Dana alleges weren't addressed in the $1.4 billion Wall Street settlement in April over tainted research. But some observers contend those conflicts have only grown in type and number since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 2000, which lifted the last restraints preventing commercial banks from providing a full array of investment banking services. Now, big universal banks can collect sensitive data on a client as a lender at the same time their investment bankers are working on a deal that affects that same client-as Dana alleges in its suit. Conflicts, of course, are also a minefield for traditional investment banks, which may switch sides in a hostile deal, or may have individual bankers covering bitter rivals at the same time.</p><p>\"It is very opportunistic on the part of the investment banks, and it is the reason why corporations and investment banks need to keep a real distance from each other,\" says Professor Samuel Hayes, the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking Emeritus at Harvard Business School. \"Neither one is willing to make a long-term commitment.\"</p><p>On the client side, companies in search of best terms often play the switching game. \"Companies' attitude is, What have you done for me lately,'\" says Hayes. \"They are always willing to take a look at somebody else's product or service.\"</p><p>On the bank side, \"that's the problem with these financial supermarkets,\" says a senior M&amp;A banker who worked at a universal bank. \"They want to have a relationship with everybody. Of course they have conflicts. The question is: Do they manage them well or not?\"</p><p>Managing conflicts</p><p>Some conflicts arise from bankers working closely together in one group. Bankers in universal banks are grouped by industry these days and are no longer separated into commercial and investment bankers. \"UBS has a small automotive group working in one office,\" said one person familiar with its banking structure. \"How difficult is it for confidential information to make its way from one banker to another?\"</p><p>Overall, banks do try to manage these conflicts. \"Banks protect the information by putting up Chinese walls and keeping the teams separate,\" says Malcolm Ross, an M&amp;A partner with Kronish Lieb Weiner &amp; Hellman LLP. Many conduct a \"conflict check\" on new accounts, says a senior M&amp;A banker. In a hostile situation, the conflict check is more thorough, and tries to list all potential problems.</p><p>\"It is not fair to clients to have the same banker be engaged by head to head competitors, says Sam Schwartz, a partner at the boutique investment bank of Bryant Park Capital.</p><p>Traditional investment banks and specialized advisory boutiques like the Blackstone Group and Lazard LLC, which don't lend, have their own problem-which some call \"competitive conflict.\"</p><p>Several bankers cite Lazard, in particular, in the swashbuckling days of the late 1980s and early 1990s as being prone to jumping sides, especially for media/entertainment deals. That made it tough on CEOs, who had to weigh Lazard's deep industry knowledge and understanding of competitors with the risk that it might decamp for a rival at any time.</p><p>Lazard says its posture is much different these days. Says Kenneth Jacobs, deputy chairman and the head of Lazard U.S.: \"While clients often hire bankers for their balance sheet or industry expertise, ultimately to establish a trusted relationship the client and banker must be sure their interests are aligned.\"</p><p>The size of Blackstone's banking team is small enough to be beneficial in managing conflicts. Blackstone Vice Chairman Hamilton James says the firm limits the hiring of additional bankers who might create client conflicts. In the case of broad sectors like financial services, it may assign several senior bankers, but each focuses on a different aspect, like insurance and asset management.</p><p>\"We tend to focus on a few key relationships in any given sector,\" says James. \"If it so happens that the company has more than one key relationship in an industry, we assure our clients that their banking team is devoted to them and is not calling on their direct competitors.\"</p><p>Merits of a case</p><p>There is no law against switching sides, so to determine the merit of a lawsuit such as Dana's, the courts look at case law, says an attorney with a major law firm that specializes in takeovers. The courts examine the validity of a claim through several prisms, including whether a contract between the company and the adviser stipulating confidentiality exists, whether there was a breach of fiduciary duty, and whether there was use of insider information.</p><p>If a client and a bank have a written agreement that bars the bank from divulging or using confidential information, the agreement may be enforceable in court, lawyers say.</p><p>Dana, which accuses UBS of breach of contract and misuse of confidential information, is asking, in addition to financial compensation, that UBS resign from the advisory role to ArvinMeritor. It also wants to know what data were revealed, and to whom. So far, UBS has only resigned as Dana's adviser.</p><p>Bankers point out that getting another adviser may not help Dana in staying independent. They also say that some of these lawsuits disappear when the deal is resolved.</p><p>As is typical in hostile battles, much of the action is on the public relations front, where questioning the integrity of a hostile bidder is fair game, says a senior M&amp;A banker.</p><p>Banks that find themselves in a possible conflict can score points by resigning early without a fight. Deutsche Bank, which had provided Dana with a fairness opinion regarding Arvin's bid, subsequently resigned, saying it had held some talks with Arvin regarding Dana.</p><p>The Dana case is but the latest in Street conflicts. Mannesmann AG sued Goldman Sachs in 1999, asking that Goldman resign as Vodafone Plc's adviser in defending against a hostile bid from Mannesmann. The German telecom company argued that Goldman had confidential information from prior work for Mannesmann, which included a bid for Orange Plc. Goldman stepped down even before the court ruled.</p><p>But in another case, Salomon Smith Barney fought in 2000 to stay on as an adviser to North Fork Bancorp in its hostile takeover battle for Dime Bancorp.Dime successfully sued, however, and Salomon stepped down.</p><p>Copyright 2003 Thomson Media Inc.

Lehman Brothers, and many other institutions, will collapse in a matter of months.                    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     Blackberries ring unanswered in boardrooms as bailout talks continue. On the streets of London, black cabs sweep City workers off the kerb. Meanwhile, across schools and universities, students pore over Facebook (US:FB) - a relatively nascent platform - with few concerns about who can access their private content. As exam season approaches, some head to Waterstones to buy textbooks: quicker, and cheaper, than ordering online.                   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                       March 2018: Banks are grappling with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), the culmination of a decade of reforms and sanctions designed to avoid another disaster. But as the financial services sector has claimed authorities' full attention, another group of companies has grown, unfettered, into a near-monopoly. Apple's (US:AAPL) iPhones dominate the smartphone market. Uber has undercut other taxi firms, offering cheaper rides at the touch of a button. Meanwhile, Amazon (US:AZN) can deliver almost anything to your door within hours.                   </p><p>It's no surprise that 2018 is set to be a major year for regulation. Governments and market authorities around the world have seemingly acted simultaneously, recognising that one of their key priorities, consumer protection, has been endangered by the rise of 'Big Tech', and a lack of restrictions around the sharing of personal data. But, acting 'simultaneously' does not always mean 'in unison'. Indeed, in some instances, the new rules around data - specifically within Mifid II, the Open Banking regime and the EU's new general data protection regulation (GDPR) - appear to challenge one another.</p><p>Data governance is just one among a raft of statutes affecting sectors from telecoms to energy suppliers.

Some have already come into effect. Others may be delayed as lawmakers negotiate with industry leaders                     1) New reporting standards (IFRS 9 and IFRS 15)                     1 January 2018                     Sectors affected:                     IFRS 9 - financial services; IFRS 15 - outsourcers, technology, software and computer services (any companies that rely on contracts to generate revenue)                     IFRS 9Banks are no strangers to regulatory complexity, but 2018 promises to be a particularly busy year, with Mifid II, data privacy rules and the latest payment services directive obliging them to open up data to third parties. The cherry on top of this regulatory trifle is IFRS 9, which alters the way that loan losses are accounted for and ultimately reported.Under the previous 'IAS 39' rule, banks used so-called incurred loss models. The problems with this system were exposed during the financial crisis, when banks couldn't report losses ahead of time. IFRS 9 compels lenders to use expected credit loss (ECL) models, predicting how much they could potentially lose on loans and making provisions for these losses.The issue is that lending banks must also maintain common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital. The introduction of IFRS 9 could cause sudden increases in ECLs, which could in turn reduce these capital buffers.To smooth any resultant volatility, banks have been given five years to manage the transition. Upon applying IFRS 9, if an institution's opening balance sheet reveals a reduction in CET1 capital because of the new ECL standard, it can include a portion of the increased ECL provisions within its CET1 capital. This portion should decline to zero over the five years.The effects of IFRS 9 are already being acknowledged. In its full-year results, Lloyds (LLOY) said that transitional relief will reduce the impact on its CET1 capital ratio from around 30 basis points to just 1 basis point. For Barclays (BARC), the effect is similar: a likely 34 basis point impact under the \"fully-loaded CET1 ratio\" was ultimately \"negligible as at 1 January 2018\".IC view: IFRS 9 brings greater transparency, and should help both bank customers and investors more accurately understand capital structures and exposure. The long-term impacts will become more apparent as the standard is incorporated into all financial reports. Transitional arrangements should help to mitigate initial capital fluctuations, and give stakeholders time to see how the regulation works in practice, although potential volatility cannot be ruled out. IFRS 15 The way in which companies recognise revenues has a serious impact on results from one year to the next, and ultimately on investors' returns. IFRS 15 provides rules to alleviate some of the \"uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer\". Essentially, companies must now recognise revenues when goods or services are supplied to a customer; not just when they sign a contract. In theory, this means investors can no longer be misled by strategically-timed revenue recognition.To recognise revenue under IFRS 15, companies must apply five steps. First: identify the contract with the customer. Second: identify the contract's performance obligations. Third: determine the transaction price - the sum the company expects to receive. Fourth: allocate this price to each 'performance obligation'. Finally, revenue can be recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied by the transfer of goods or a service.OutsourcersOutsourcing - the business of contracting - is heavily affected by IFRS 15. Capita (CAP) introduced the standard early, in September 2017. Restating its 2016 full-year results, the group said underlying revenues would be 5 per cent lower, operating profit 30 per cent lower and the balance sheet would endure a swing to negative shareholders' equity. IFRS 15 isn't the only problem facing Capita, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/01/31/capita-suspends-dividend/\">which recently suspended its dividend and cut profit expectations</url> - but it did damage the share price.Serco's (SER) management does not anticipate a significant impact. The expected restatement of 2017's numbers should reduce revenue by \u00a33m and underlying trading profit by \u00a30.3m. The standard will have a greater effect on new contracts if they have lengthy transition phases, which Serco says could delay profit and revenue recognition. Meanwhile, IC buy tip Babcock (BAB) seems relatively unperturbed, stating that it does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will require a change in profit or revenue recognition.Other sectors have been flagged for disruption by IFRS 15. Last September, analysts at Liberum said they envisaged \"more surprises in the pipeline\" with particular reference to aerospace and defence, construction, software, support services and telecoms. Investors in these sectors should keep their eyes peeled. For example, we already know that 90 per cent of Meggitt's (MGGT) revenues come from the sale of goods where revenue is recognised at the time of shipping, although the aerospace group doesn't expect the new standard to change this significantly.SoftwareBroker N+1 Singer says IFRS 15 will require many software companies \"to reset their numbers\", with those using up-front licence models, and with significant hardware and professional services revenue, most affected. Cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) companies with annual subscription models should endure less change. To wit, see Fidessa's (FDSA) recent full-year numbers. The group expects IFRS15 to have a less than 1 per cent impact on reported revenue for 2018. This appears to be because 88 per cent of the company's top line constitutes recurring revenue.IC view: Software companies will need to gauge whether different revenue streams, including licences, deployment and upgrades, should be bundled together as one performance obligation, or considered separately. Ultimately, the new standard should benefit investors, who will receive a more transparent and accurate insight into how and when revenues arise. HC 2) Mifid II3 January 2018Sectors affected:Financial servicesLike most financial regulation, Mifid II was long in planning and delayed in implementation. It finally arrived on 3 January, in the shape of one of the EU's most ambitious and far-reaching financial reforms, covering practically every aspect of trading and applying to all financial services companies with EU clients. It is designed to address the shortcomings of Mifid I, which focused too heavily on equities trading - a fact revealed shortly after its introduction at the onset of the financial crisis in November 2007. The updated version also now addresses the vast markets for derivatives and bonds that operate outside formal exchanges.Mifid II has been designed to create greater transparency and resilience within financial markets, injecting more competition and protecting investors. Put simply, it means financial institutions, including investment providers, brokers and advisers, must be more up-front about when they transact and what they charge. In turn, that means creating a data trail behind traded assets. Compliance spend - principally the investment-focused variety - was estimated to be $2.1bn in 2017 alone for global investment banks and asset managers, according to research by IHS Markit and Expand.That means additional operating costs for asset managers, although the bulk of the up-front costs were taken last year. However, judging by figures reported by UK-listed financial services companies for 2017, these costs haven't eaten too much into the bottom line. What's likely to have the greater impact on brokers, banks and asset managers is the requirement for the latter to pay the former two groups directly for research, rather than being bundled into the cost of buying and selling securities.The logic is that using dealing commissions to purchase research causes a conflict of interest for investment managers, as they use transaction costs to pay for this research. That's expected to cost between 5 and 20 basis points of assets under management, according to a survey by the CFA Institute. The question is whether asset managers pass on the cost to clients or not. Companies such as Liontrust Asset Management (LIO) have decided to absorb the charge themselves, while (in a wise PR move) Fidelity backtracked on its original decision to pass on the cost to its clients.Those potentially hurt the most by the unbundling of research costs are brokerages, with institutional investors becoming pickier about the analyst coverage they consume. Numis (NUM) said it was too early to assess the eventual financial impact. The regulation also reduces the incentive for brokers to produce research on companies, given they will need to bear the cost of producing it without any guarantee of selling it. The consensus among analysts is that this will lead to a decline in coverage of certain stocks - small-caps, in particular - and therefore a reduction in liquidity in equity markets and bigger swings in share prices. This may be one of the most significant impacts on retail investors, most of whom have limited (or no) access to professional research.IC view: Some companies thrive on regulatory complexity, and we think there could be a few winners as the changes bed in. At the end of last year, Nex (NXG) increased investment in sales and marketing initiatives around its Abide Financial regulatory reporting service, to take advantage of a bump in work for companies that had still not got their compliance in order. Financial consultancy groups Sanne (SNN) and Alpha Financial Markets Consulting (AFM) have both attributed rising profits during the past year partly to an increase in demand from financial institutions for compliance services ahead of the regulation. In finance, as in trading, volatility and disruption will almost always be good for at least one group. EP Software and Mifid IIMifid II has driven demand for regulatory software, as clients seek precision, efficiency and in some cases automation to ensure full compliance.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Trading software specialist Fidessa (FDSA) believes Mifid II will lead to \"a long tail of work\" this year, due to some delayed elements. Moreover, the directive's January launch has freed up financial capacity, meaning there's room for investment in new opportunities - or indeed margin expansion. Perhaps this bright outlook explains why Fidessa may be off the market soon: Swiss software group Temenos (SW:TEMN) recently launched a \u00a31.4bn bid for the UK company.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>First Derivatives (FDP) said in its half-year report that regulation and compliance - including Mifid II - \"remain key drivers of its business\".</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Small-cap StatPro (SOG) offers cloud-based portfolio analytics tools to investors, and helps asset managers improve client service while complying with regulations.

The first was that customers would be best served by measures to improve competition. The second - that it would be better to restrict pricing. Limited steps have been taken in both directions with the introduction of a price cap for prepayment meters and efforts to make switching to a new supplier easier, but in recent months political pressure from both sides of the aisle has meant suppliers are once again looking at a cap on the prices they can charge their customers.</p><p>The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act 2018 was introduced in October last year and temporarily limits the amount that can be charged to consumers on the standard variable tariff (SVT). The cap level itself will be set by Ofgem, the market regulator, and will last until at least the end of 2020, with the potential for extension out to 2023. In February, MPs from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee called for the cap to be brought into effect in time for the end of 2018, so as to protect vulnerable customers during the winter months. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets described this as \"an ambitious target\".</p><p>The energy suppliers have already started to look at ways to prevent or minimise the damage of any cap. Centrica (CNA) led the charge late last year with a raft of proposals both for how it would reform (eg by withdrawing the SVT for new customers) and how the government should adapt (eg by funding renewable subsidies through general taxation rather than through bills, as it is currently). SSE (SSE) took a different approach, proposing to demerge from its household energy supply business, combining it with rival NPower and listing it as a new company, thereby exiting the market.</p><p>                     IC view: There is a real possibility the cap will not come into effect until 2019, meaning it could potentially last less than two years. Despite this, the impact of this legislation is already being felt, as the share prices of Centrica and SSE demonstrate. Both can be expected to suffer once a cap is in place, unless SSE manages to leave the household supply market as it plans to. Approach the sector with caution. TD</p><p>                     8) Antitrust: 2018 and beyond                   </p><p>                     Sectors affected: Big Tech                   </p><p>There is certainly something dystopian about corporate giants that provide everything we eat, read and watch; own all our data; navigate our journeys and even have a semi-conscious presence in our homes. The investor George Soros fears conglomerates, particularly in the tech space, could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\". In 1984, Big Brother was always watching. In 2018, Big Brother's name is Alexa.</p><p>And it is not just their dominance which has critics worried. US tech firms have been accused of being anti-competitive and stifling fair trade. Amazon is a retailer and a marketplace. Google makes money by publishing content while determining the position of that content on its own search engine. Facebook doesn't need to make money from WhatsApp and Instagram because its newsfeed shares a duopoly in the digital advertising market with Google.</p><p>In the past few decades these companies and their peers have tiptoed from start-ups to corporate behemoths. Their growth has been largely organic, they have mainly made small acquisitions and they have refrained from engaging in mega-mergers. By and large, they have avoided the critical eye of competition laws.</p><p>US corporate antitrust law is governed by three statutes that are more than a century old. They restrict the formation of cartels which could hold back trade, limit M&amp;A and prevent the creation of monopolies. And yet today in America a handful of companies control the same proportion of their respective markets as Standard Oil did when it was chopped up in 1911.</p><p>For years, these companies have been heralded as pioneers of digital America. But now - with Amazon raising the price of its books, Google increasingly embroiled in unsavoury ad campaigns, and Facebook facing calls to prevent interference on its platform by nation states - regulators have had enough. In 2017, the European Commission fined Google (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.14bn) for prioritising its own shopping site. Germany's cartel office accused Facebook of unfairly using its position to track internet users. France has threatened to fine Facebook for sharing data between its apps. Australia's competition authority has launched an investigation into the market power of Facebook and Google. And even former US antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of Google's acquisition of YouTube and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram looks naive in hindsight.</p><p>Dealing with tech dominance is no mean feat. As former US federal judge Richard Posner wrote, about an earlier chapter in the internet revolution: \"This problem will be extremely difficult to solve; indeed, I cannot even glimpse the solution.\" The difficulties lie in the fact that antitrust laws exist not to protect small businesses but to maximise consumer welfare, or what Robert Bork in 1978 dubbed \"the antitrust paradox\". Forty years on and Mr Bork's theory is starting to bite. Companies that try to team up to take on the might of the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google) are being regulated, while the giants can keep growing.</p><p>To avoid the dystopian future predicted by Mr Soros, global governments perhaps need a fundamental rethink of competition laws. After all, the world has changed a lot since the existent antitrust statutes were inscribed.</p><p>                     IC view: The 100-year-old US anti-trust laws are not going to be rewritten in 2018, but the fact that they are even being talked about should arouse concern for big tech monopolies. In the short-term FANG company shareholders should perhaps be wary that their uncontested days are coming to an end. The debate is also relevant for investors in the wider marketplace, as the rise in monopolistic corporate power may be an important factor behind elevated levels of profitability. That means changes in anti-trust laws could have a real, albeit slow, impact on equity market returns. MB</p><p>***</p><p>More regulations can be expected in due course. IFRS 16, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/01/31/capita-suspends-dividend/\">governing how companies recognise and measure leases, will be introduced in 2019</url>. Regulation around advertising is also high on the international agenda. Arguably, as technology comes to underpin every industry, those regulating each sector will need to work hand in glove to prevent dangerous scenarios - all the while encouraging innovation. Ten years ago, we endured the global financial crisis. Today, perhaps, we must try to stave off a global technology crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-42116404</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTW-6J91-JCJY-G264-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3450\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 9, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

But as the financial services sector has claimed authorities' full attention, another group of companies has grown, unfettered, into a near-monopoly. Apple's (US:AAPL) iPhones dominate the smartphone market. Uber has undercut other taxi firms, offering cheaper rides at the touch of a button. Meanwhile, Amazon (US:AZN) can deliver almost anything to your door within hours.</p><p>firms, offering It's no surprise that 2018 is set to be a major year for regulation. Governments and market authorities around the world have seemingly acted simultaneously, recognising that one of their key priorities, consumer protection, has been endangered by the rise of 'Big Tech', and a lack of restrictions around the sharing of personal data. But, acting 'simultaneously' does not always mean 'in unison'. Indeed, in some instances, the new rules around data - specifically within Mifid II, the Open Banking regime and the EU's new general data protection regulation (GDPR) - appear to challenge one another.</p><p>Data governance is just one among a raft of statutes affecting sectors from telecoms to energy suppliers. Some have already come into effect. Others may be delayed as lawmakers negotiate with industry leaders. But each of these changes raise questions about the purpose of regulation. What is the aim of the regulator? To protect the individual, to safeguard investors, to encourage competition, or to protect citizens from corporate giants? In our analysis, we have selected those mandates most relevant for UK investors this year.</p><p>1) NEW REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS 9 AND IFRS 15 Date: 1 January 2018 Sectors affected: IFRS 9, financial services; IFRS 15, outsourcers, technology, software and computer services (companies that rely on contracts to generate revenue) IFRS 9 Banks are no strangers to regulatory complexity, but 2018 promises to be a particularly busy year, with Mifid II, data privacy rules and the latest payment services directive obliging them to open up data to third parties. The cherry on top of this regulatory trifle is IFRS 9, which alters the way that loan losses are accounted for and ultimately reported.</p><p>Under the previous 'IAS 39' rule, banks used socalled incurred loss models. The problems with this system were exposed during the financial crisis, when banks couldn't report losses ahead of time. IFRS 9 compels lenders to use expected credit loss (ECL) models, predicting how much they could potentially lose on loans and making provisions for these losses.</p><p>The issue is that lending banks must also maintain common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital. The introduction of IFRS 9 could cause sudden increases in ECLs, which could in turn reduce these capital buffers.</p><p>To smooth any resultant volatility, banks have been given five years to manage the transition. Upon applying IFRS 9, if an institution's opening balance sheet reveals a reduction in CET1 capital because of the new ECL standard, it can include a portion of the increased ECL provisions within its CET1 capital. This portion should decline to zero over the five years.</p><p>The effects of IFRS 9 are already being acknowledged. In its full-year results, Lloyds (LLOY) said that transitional relief will reduce the impact on its CET1 capital ratio from around 30 basis points to just 1 basis point. For Barclays (BARC), the effect is similar: a likely 34 basis point impact under the \"fully-loaded CET1 ratio\" was ultimately \"negligible as at 1 January 2018\".</p><p>IFRS 9 brings greater transparency, and should help both bank customers and investors more accurately understand capital structures and exposure. The long-term impacts will become more apparent as the standard is incorporated into all financial reports. Transitional arrangements should help to mitigate initial capital fluctuations, and give stakeholders time to see how the regulation works in practice, although potential volatility cannot be ruled out.</p><p>IFRS 15 The way in which companies recognise revenues has a serious impact on results from one year to the next, and ultimately on investors' returns. IFRS 15 provides rules to alleviate some of the \"uncertainty of revenue and cash flows froma contractwith a customer\". Essentially, companies must now recognise revenues when goods or services are supplied to a customer; not just when they sign a contract. In theory, this means investors can no longer be misled by strategically-timed revenue recognition.</p><p>To recognise revenue under IFRS 15, companies must apply five steps. First: identify the contract with the customer. Second: identify the contract's performance obligations. Third: determine the transaction price - the sum the company expects to receive. Fourth: allocate this price to each 'performance obligation'. Finally, revenue can be recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied by the transfer of goods or a service.</p><p>Outsourcers Outsourcing - the business of contracting - is heavily affected by IFRS 15. Capita (CAP) introduced the standard early, in September 2017. Restating its 2016 full-year results, the group said underlying revenues would be 5 per cent lower, operating profififit 30 per cent lower and the balance sheet would endure a swing to negative shareholders' equity. IFRS 15 isn't the only problem facing Capita, which recently suspended its dividend and cut profit expectations - but it did damage the share price.</p><p>Serco's (SER) management does not anticipate a significant impact. The expected restatement of 2017's numbers should reduce revenue by \u00a33m and underlying trading profit by \u00a30.3m. The standard will have a greater effffffect on new contracts if they have lengthy transition phases, which Serco says could delay profit and revenue recognition. Meanwhile, IC buy tip Babcock (BAB) seems relatively unperturbed, stating that it does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will require a change in profit or revenue recognition.</p><p>Other sectors have been flagged for disruption by IFRS 15. Last September, analysts at Liberum said they envisaged \"more surprises in the pipeline\" with particular reference to aerospace and defence, construction, software, support services and telecoms. Investors in these sectors should keep their eyes peeled. For example, we already know that 90 per cent of Meggitt's (MGGT) revenues come from the sale of goods where revenue is recognised at the time of shipping, although the aerospace group doesn't expect the new standard to change this significantly.</p><p>Software Broker N+1 Singer says IFRS 15 will require many software companies \"to reset their numbers\", with those using up-front licence models, and with significant hardware and professional services revenue, most affected. Cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) companies with annual subscription models should endure less change. To wit, see Fidessa's (FDSA) recent full-year numbers. The group expects IFRS15 to have a less than 1 per cent impact on reported revenue for 2018. This appears to be because 88 per cent of the company's top line constitutes recurring revenue.</p><p>Software companies will need to gauge whether different revenue streams, including licences, deployment and upgrades, should be bundled together as oneperformanceobligation,or consideredseparately. Ultimately, thenewstandardshouldbenefit investors, who will receive a more transparent and accurate insight into howandwhen revenues arise. HC 2) MIFID II Date: 3 January 2018 Sectors affected: Financial services Likemost financial regulation,Mifid IIwas long in planning and delayed in implementation. It finally arrived on 3 January, in the shape of one of the EU's most ambitious and far-reaching financial reforms, covering practically every aspect of trading and applying to all financial services companies with EU clients. It is designed to address the shortcomings of Mifid I, which focused too heavily on equities trading - a fact revealed shortly after its introduction at the onset of the financial crisis in November 2007. The updated version also now addresses the vast markets for derivatives and bonds that operate outside formal exchanges.</p><p>Mifid II has been designed to create greater transparency and resilience within financial markets, injecting more competition and protecting investors. Put simply, it means financial institutions, including investment providers, brokers and advisers, must be more up-front about when they transact and what they charge. In turn, that means creating a data trail behind traded assets. Compliance spend - principally the investment-focused variety - was estimated to be $2.1bn in 2017 alone for global investment banks and asset managers, according to research by IHS Markit and Expand.</p><p>That means additional operating costs for asset managers, although the bulk of the up-front costs were taken last year. However, judging by figures reported by financial UK-listed financial services companies for 2017, these costs haven't eaten too much into the bottom line. What's likely to have the greater impact on brokers, banks and asset managers is the requirement for the latter to pay the former two groups directly for research, rather than being bundled into the cost of buying and selling securities.</p><p>The logic is that using dealing commissions to conflict purchase research causes a conflict of interest for investment managers, as they use transaction costs to pay for this research. That's expected to cost between 5 and 20 basis points of assets under management, according to a survey by the CFA Institute. The question is whether asset managers pass on the cost to clients or Liontrust Asset Management have decided to absorb the charge themselves, while (in a wise PR move) Fidelity backtracked on its not. Companies such as AssetManagement (LIO) original decision to pass on the cost to its clients.</p><p>Those potentially hurt the most by the unbundling of research costs are brokerages, with institutional investors becoming pickier about the analyst coverage they consaid it was too early to assess the consume. Numis (NUM) said eventual financial impact. The regulation also reduces the incentive for brokers to produce research on companies, given they will need to bear the cost of producing it without any guarantee of selling it.The consensus among analysts is that this will lead to a decline in coverage of certain stocks - small-caps, in particular - and therefore a reduction in liquidity in equity markets and bigger swings in share prices. This may be one of the most significant impacts on retail investors, most of whom have significant limited (or no) access to professional research.</p><p>Some companies thrive on regulatory complexity, plexity, and we think there could be a few winners as the changes bed in. At the end of last year, Nex (NXG) increased investment in sales and marketing initiatives around its Abide Financial regulatory reporting service, to take advantage of a bump in work for companies that had still not got their compliance in order. Financial consultancy groups Sanne (SNN) and Alpha Financial Markets Consulting (AFM) have both attributed rising profits during the past year partly to an increase in demand from financial institutions for compliance services ahead of the regulation. In finance, as in trading, volatility and disruption will FinancialMarkets profits fromfinancial finance, almost always be good for at least one group. EP Software and Mifid II Mifid II has driven demand for regulatory software, as clients seek precision, efficiency and in some cases automation to ensure full compliance.</p><p>Mifid efficiency \u00a6 Trading software specialist Fidessa (FDSA) believes Mifid II will lead to \"a long tail of work\" this year, due to some delayed elements. Moreover, the directive's January launch has freed up financial capacity, meaning there's room for investment in new opportunities - or indeed margin expansion. Perhaps this bright outlook explains why Fidessa may be offthe market soon: Swiss software group Temenos (SW:TEMN) recently launched a \u00a31.4bn bid for the UK company. \u00a6 First Derivatives (FDP) said in its half-year report that regulation and compliance - including Mifid II - Mifid \"remain key drivers of its business\".</p><p>offers \u00a6 Small-cap StatPro (SOG) offers cloud-based portfolio analytics tools to investors, and helps asset managers improve client service while complying with regulations. Analysts at Stifel say Mifid II is acting as a tailwind alongside the company's own product refresh cycle.</p><p>Mifid HC 3) SECOND PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE AND OPEN BANKING Date: 13 January 2018 Sectors affected: Financial services, technology, software and computer services, 'Big Tech', retailers,media The payments industry is one good example of a business line that has transcended the boundaries of historic regulation. The EU's first Payment Services Directive (PSD) was incorporated into UK law in 2009. Since then, technology has driven a global shift in how we transact - epitomised by our dwindling usage of coins and notes over the past decade. Electronic and mobile payment methods have both facilitated and been spurred on by the stratospheric rise of global e-commerce.</p><p>Until this year, banks continued to enjoy exclusive access to customers' account data - the very fuel that could enable newer market entrants to offer competitive products and services. This data monopoly ended on 13 January 2018, with the introduction of the second payment services directive (PSD2). The revised regulation aims for \"more competition, greater choice and better prices for consumers\", while seeking to better integrate the internal market for electronic payments within the EU. Because of PSD2, customers can now open up their payments accounts to organisations ranging from challenger banks to start-up financial technology businesses, as long as they give consent.</p><p>Open Banking In the UK, PSD2 has been implemented as 'Open Banking', under the watch of the Competition and Markets Authority. The move forces the country's nine largest retail banks to share customer data securely with third parties, via 'application programming interfaces' (APIs) - software based on a standardised set of rules.</p><p>From an investment perspective, various listed tech, software and retail companies stand to benefit from the new regulatory environment. There are also opportunities for the incumbent banks, if they can adapt and innovate. However, some fear that new participants in the financial services sector will undermine banks' trusted client relationships.</p><p>Account aggregators Under the new rules, businesses can become regulated Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), acting as central hubs for data from various bank accounts - 'account aggregators' in the jargon.</p><p>Digital banks are one group competing to act as account <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aggregators.UK\">www.aggregators.UK</url> start-up Monzo provides aggregation and spend-tracking software, and it is now working with Moneybox, an app that allows users to invest extra change from purchases into tracker funds. Such alternative savings and investment vehicles off.</p><p>cles should proliferate as Open Banking takes off. Meanwhile, proving it can stay in the game even if the rules change, larger and more traditional bank HSBC (HSBA) will launch its 'Beta' app this year - allowing customers to monitor various bank, transactional and investment accounts from multiple institutions. By offering spend analysis and advice, offering HSBC hopes to improve customer loyalty, and may even poach customers from rivals. Netherlands-quoted ING (NTH:INGA) operates 'Yolt', an aggregation platform offering spend-tracking. Both Lloyds and RBS are reportedly developing apps with Open Banking capabilities, and others are expected to follow. And as banks open up, security is another key theme to monitor; which should play well to the strengths of Eckoh (ECK), a specialist in secure payments (and IC buy tip).</p><p>Retailers PSD2 and Open Banking represent a boon for retailers. Once authorised, these businesses can accept payments directly from customers' bank accounts without an intermediary. Open Banking allows retailers to offer greater flexibility, faster refunds, and - according to Jeremy Light, head of Accenture's (US: ACN) European payments practice - \"to increase cash flow by bypassing card networks and fees and reducing fraud and chargebacks\".</p><p>For banks, however, this could mean fewer debit card transactions. Generally speaking, as Open Banking welcomes new competitors, we may see more mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A) among both banks and long-established payments institutions, seeking greater scale and tech expertise. To name but one example, Worldpay (WPY) has already merged with US-based Vantiv, in a \u00a39bn deal which also attracted early-stage interest from JPMorgan.</p><p>To date, just a few fintech businesses have floated. We may well see a spate of initial public offerings (IPOs) in due course. That said, Augmentum FinTech - a private fund - plans to list on London's main market on 13 March 2018, sized at around \u00a3100m on admission. With the financial services sector \"being revolutionised by technology\", Augmentum intends to acquire a seed portfolio of high-growth assets valued at \u00a333.3m, including investments in BullionVault, Interactive Investor, Seedrs, SRL Global and Zopa.</p><p>'Big' fintech It might feel like fintech firms and retailers have reasons to celebrate in 2018. However, some believe 'Big Tech' giants will emerge the true winners of PSD2. They already hold heaps of customer data - bank information and the ability to initiate payments could be the final pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez, executive chairman at Spanish bank BBVA (SP:BBV), recently warned that companies including US-listed Facebook and Amazon, and China's Alibaba and Tencent, will \"replace many banks\"; only this week, Amazon has fulfilled the prophecy, revealing that it's in talks with JPMorgan to provide its customers with bank accounts. Referencing uneven regulation between banks and techs, he said: \"If I need capital to lend then let's have the same rules for everyone - for the internet giants too.\"</p><p>PSD2 and Open Banking are landmark regulations, democratising transactional data to give challengers - and banking customers - more choice. A likely increase in switching activity could benefit listed price comparison sites such benefit as Moneysupermarket (MONY). Quoted retailers may improve sales by circumventing card payments. Meanwhile, to preserve client relationships, banks must prioritise digital services. This means competing - or indeed partnering with - the new kids on the block. In doing so, they may also uncover serious growth opportunities. HC 5) BROADBAND WHOLESALE LOCAL ACCESS Date: 1 April 2018 Sectors affected: British telecoms To cut prices or not to cut prices? That is the question Ofcom has been toying with for the past couple of years. The price in question is what BT (BT.A) charges its wholesale customers - including Sky (SKY), Vodafone (VOD) and TalkTalk (TALK) - to use its Openreach broadband infrastructure.</p><p>For many years, BT has enjoyed a near monopoly in UK broadband. Aside from the smaller networks owned and run by Virgin Media and CityFibre (CITY), it is the only company that owns the infrastructure needed to deliver internet to homes and businesses. Sure, consumers can buy their internet from other telecoms companies, but these are all required to rent the cables offBT. The problem with this lack of competition is that BT has had very little reason to invest in Openreach, leaving the UK's broadband speeds trailing far behind those in Europe. Less than 2 per cent of UK homes have access to full fibreoptic broadband, which offers speeds up to 10 times faster than the copper cables most homes and businesses currently rely on. All the while, BT has been reaping the rewards of the comfortable cash profits that flow through its Openreach subsidiary.</p><p>Ofcom initially proposed aggressive cuts to the wholesale prices, but this met with outcry from peers who worried it would stifle competition. Instead the regulator has forced BT to make minor cuts to its wholesale charges over a three-year period, banned the group from making selective price cuts in areas where it knows it will soon face competition and has allowed its peers to tack their own cables onto the existing Openreach infrastructure.</p><p>BT thinks the cost cutting will cut Openreach's sales by \u00a380m to \u00a3120m in the 2019 financial year. What's more concerning is that the proposals might speed up the arrival of competition. Already CityFibre has teamed up with Vodafone to provide full fibre broadband to 1m homes in secondary cities in the UK, TalkTalk is planning its own broadband investment with M&amp;G Prudential, and Virgin Media is mid-way through a major investment programme, which will expand the reach of its own fibre network.</p><p>For most parties involved, this regulation is very welcome. Telecoms companies should soon reduce their reliance on Openreach, while consumers will have a greater choice of internet provider. For BT, Ofcom's decision is yet another blow. The telecoms giant has a huge number of cost pressures and an increase in competition to its cash-generative Openreach subsidiary is likely to damage the outlook further. MB 6) GDPR Date: 25 May 2018 Sectors affected: Technology, software and computer services, financial services, retailers, media, utilities (the list goes on) The UK's existing data protection rules were introduced in 1998. Suffice to say, technology has been transformed since then. We live our lives increasingly online, from researching, to shopping, to connecting with friends. This momentous shift has been facilitated by the widespread adoption of smartphones, and the rise of the Internet of Things - whereby all devices, from TVs to toasters, are connected.</p><p>In turn, the internet's near-ubiquity has given rise to a swirling mass of personal data. Each time we browse the web or make a transaction, we hand over swathes of information about ourselves - from addresses, to restaurant preferences, to medical histories. This might be processed, stored or sold on by the recipient for numerous purposes.</p><p>Data sharing has brought many benefits to consumers, but it has also prompted global concerns about privacy. In May 2018, the EU will introduce its general data protection regulation (GDPR). Under GDPR, businesses must prove that they have a lawful basis for processing personal data. The rules encompass some core principles. Companies must ensure customers give their full consent for data processing. A pre-ticked box is insufficient. Individuals also receive various new rights. Among others, these include the right to be informed how their data has been processed, the right to rectification, if data is incorrect, and the right to data erasure.</p><p>GDPR also gives rights to consumers regarding automated decision-making, including profiling. The impact of this could be significant, given the proliferation of artificial intelligence. Companies must now inform people about automated processing of their information, and introduce ways for them to request human intervention or challenge an automated decision.</p><p>The penalties for non-compliance are severe.</p><p>Perpetrators could pay up the greater of (EURO)20m or 4 per cent of their annual global turnover; potentially crippling for smaller companies, and a severe financial and reputational blow for large players too.</p><p>What does this mean for investors? GDPR poses a challenge for many listed businesses, which must spend more on compliance. However, it also presents some exciting opportunities, if companies can comply effectively - or indeed provide the technology to help other organisations fulfil their regulatory obligations.</p><p>Big Tech processors The UK's current Data Protection Act applies to data controllers; those determining the purposes and means for processing personal data. GDPR puts data processors under the spotlight too. Alongside smaller peers, this change affects the likes of Amazon and Alphabet. While this super-sector is largely headquartered in the US, any company with operations in the EU must play by the European rulebook. All will have to comply, to avoid a billion-dollar sales hit.</p><p>Identity specialists For the incumbent data specialists, the new rules should enhance the competitive advantage of those with large existent databanks. Examples of UK-quoted data giants include Relx (REL), which elevated its barriers to entry via its acquisition of ThreatMetrix - a digital identity specialist - for \u00a3580m in January this year. We also expect GDPR bodes well for information services provider Experian (EXPN). Like Relx, Experian's scale should facilitate its own compliance, and enable it to help customers with theirs. As May approaches, data intelligence specialist GB Group (GBG) also looks well-positioned.</p><p>Market research and data analytics YouGov (YOU) already holds vast quantities of data. In January this year, the market researcher said it would overshoot previous trading expectations thanks partly to its higher-margin data products and services. The company also recently launched its digital advertising platform, YouGov Direct, which uses blockchain technology to verify data sharing between consumers and advertisers - acknowledging that consumers currently have little say in how their data is exchanged.</p><p>Protecting against breaches GDPR's fines provide a strong incentive to protect against privacy breaches. Various high-profile attacks in recent years - 'WannaCry' and 'Petya', to name but two - revealed just how damaging hacks can be. That backdrop should continue to play to the strengths of cybercrimefocused Sophos (SOPH) and NCC (NCC), although we are neutral on the prospects for both. The former saw various director share sales last year, and recently reported a slowdown in billings growth. Meanwhile, Softcat (SCT) spies \"a good opportunity\" in GDPR, given the challenge it poses to the security firm's clients.</p><p>All companies managing personal data must prepare for GDPR. This means most PLCs. Noncompliance could lead to customer law-suits, not just fines. Establishing consent is essential for retailers and marketers among other consumer businesses. In complying with GDPR, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) believes there is regulatory alignment. And the UK government has proposed a national Data Protection Bill, which would help GDPR to survive Brexit. HC 8)ANTITRUST:2018ANDBEYOND Sectors affected: Big tech There is certainly something dystopian about corporate giants that provide everything we eat, read and 4) CRUNCH TIME FOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES: G20 FORUM Date: March 2018 Sectors affected: Cryptocurrencies, financial services The IC does not approach cryptocurrencies from the perspective of an investment. But it would be remiss to omit cryptocurrencies from an article on regulation. Indeed, there is still a general lack of consensus on whether cryptocurrencies should be deemed a proxy for money, commodities or an entirely new asset class altogether.</p><p>As the most popular of its peer group, bitcoin's share price rose stratospherically last year. At its peak, on 16 December, one bitcoin was worth around $19,000, a figure at least in part down to its lack of regulation, and representation of a decentralised, peer-to-peer traded medium of exchange (albeit one prone to serious volatility).</p><p>Cryptocurrencies have generally fared less well this year; the price of bitcoin fell below $7,000 on 5 February. This decline both drove, and was driven by, governments turning up the volume on their concerns about virtual cash, highlighting its danger to inexperienced investors and emphasising the need to crack down before it threatens financial systems.</p><p>Various economic leaders see the G20 summit, taking place later this month, as an opportunity to discuss worldwide crypto-regulation. The head of the Bank of International Settlements, Agust\u00ednCarstens, has been particularly vehement about the importance of asserting control. \"Novel technology is not the same as better technology or better economics,\" he said. Bitcoin \"has become a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster\" - the latter point referring to the amount of electricity used to \"mine\" new coins.</p><p>Moreover, one of the greatest concerns about cryptocurrency is its anonymity, rendering its origins - and potential facilitation of crime - difficult to trace.</p><p>Some countries and institutions are already taking restrictive steps. Among them, China is banning all domestic and foreign cryptocurrency trading platforms, and 'initial coin offerings' (ICOs) - the way in which companies raise digital money. South Korea will allow trading only via real-name bank accounts. Meanwhile, US banks including JPMorgan (US:JPM) and Citigroup (US:CITI), and Lloyds (LLOY) in the UK, have blocked cryptocurrency purchases on credit cards.</p><p>But for all Bitcoin's risks, advocates clearly perceive benefits beyond historic price appreciation. Some may liken it to gold, deeming it a 'safe haven' asset that could help to diversify a portfolio. It also enables immediate payments, while normal transactions can take longer. Most importantly, blockchain - the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies - has been hailed as world-changing. By providing a distributed ledger of transactions or records, blockchain could improve the way that data is registered and shared securely across multiple industries in future. That said, it is questionable whether buying bitcoin really represents an investment in blockchain.</p><p>The G20 summit could inspire a global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. As with many regulations in 2018, authorities will seek a compromise between preventing irresponsible practices and encouraging innovation. A regulated environment might lead more crypto-related businesses to consider an IPO, rather than the legally ill-defined 'initial coin offering'. For better or for worse, there's already hype among retail investors: last October, shares in minnow Aim company On-line (ONLY) soared simply on the news it would incorporate 'blockchain' into its name. HC watch; own all our data; navigate our journeys and even have a semi-conscious presence in our homes. The investor George Soros fears conglomerates, particularly in the tech space, could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\". In 1984, Big Brother was always watching. In 2018, Big Brother's name is Alexa.</p><p>And it is not just their dominance which has critics worried. US tech firms have been accused of being anti-competitive and stifling fair trade. Amazon is a retailer and a marketplace. Google makes money by publishing content while determining the position of that content on its own search engine. Facebook doesn't need to make money from WhatsApp and Instagram because its newsfeed shares a duopoly in the digital advertising market with Google.</p><p>In the past few decades these companies and their peers have tiptoed from start-ups to corporate behemoths. Their growth has been largely organic, they have mainly made small acquisitions and they have refrained from engaging in mega-mergers. By and large, they have avoided the critical eye of competition laws.</p><p>US corporate antitrust law is governed by three statutes that are more than a century old. They restrict the formation of cartels which could hold back trade, limit M&amp;A and prevent the creation of monopolies. And yet today in America a handful of companies control the same proportion of their respective markets as Standard Oil did when it was chopped up in 1911.</p><p>For years, these companies have been heralded as pioneers of digital America. But now - with Amazon raising the price of its books, Google increasingly embroiled in unsavoury ad campaigns, and Facebook facing calls to prevent interference on its platform by nation states - regulators have had enough. In 2017, the European Commission fined Google (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.14bn) for prioritising its own shopping site. Germany's cartel office accused Facebook of unfairly using its position to track internet users. France has threatened to fine Facebook for sharing data between its apps. Australia's competition authority has launched an investigation into the market power of Facebook and Google. And even former US antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of Google's acquisition of YouTube and Facebook's acquisition of Instagramlooks naive in hindsight.</p><p>Dealing with tech dominance is no mean feat. As former US federal judge Richard Posner wrote, about an earlier chapter in the internet revolution: \"This problem will be extremely difficult to solve; indeed, I cannot even glimpse the solution.\" The difficulties lie in the fact that antitrust laws exist not to protect small businesses but to maximise consumer welfare, or what Robert Bork in 1978 dubbed \"the antitrust paradox\". Forty years on and Mr Bork's theory is starting to bite. Companies that try to team up to take on the might of the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google) are being regulated, while the giants can keep growing.</p><p>To avoid the dystopian future predicted by Mr Soros, global governments perhaps need a fundamental rethink of competition laws. After all, the world has changed a lot since the existent antitrust statutes were inscribed.</p><p>The 100-year-old US anti-trust laws are not going to be rewritten in 2018, but the fact that they are even being talked about should arouse concern for big tech monopolies. In the short-term FANG company shareholders should perhaps be wary that their uncontested days are coming to an end. The debate is also relevant for investors in the wider marketplace, as the rise in monopolistic corporate power may be an important factor behind elevated levels of profitability. That means changes in antitrust laws could have a real, albeit slow, impact on equitymarket returns.MB More regulations can be expected in due course. IFRS 16, governing how companies recognise and measure leases, will be introduced in 2019. Regulation around advertising is also high on the international agenda. Arguably, as technology comes to underpin every industry, those regulating each sector will need to work hand in glove to prevent dangerous scenarios - all the while encouraging innovation. Ten years ago, we endured the global financial crisis. Today, perhaps, we must try to stave offa global technology crisis.</p><p>7) DOMESTIC GAS AND ELECTRICITY (TARIFF CAP) ACT 2018 Date: Possibly the end of 2018 Sectors affected: Energy suppliers For years, regulation of the UK's energy supply market has oscillated between two driving principles. The first was that customers would be best served by measures to improve competition. The second - that it would be better to restrict pricing. Limited steps have been taken in both directions with the introduction of a price cap for prepayment meters and efforts to make switching to a new supplier easier, but in recent months political pressure from both sides of the aisle has meant suppliers are once again looking at a cap on the prices they can charge their customers.</p><p>The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act 2018 was introduced in October last year and temporarily limits the amount that can be charged to consumers on the standard variable tariff (SVT). The cap level itself will be set by Ofgem, the market regulator, and will last until at least the end of 2020, with the potential for extension out to 2023. In February, MPs from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee called for the cap to be brought into effect in time for the end of 2018, so as to protect vulnerable customers during the winter months. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets described this as \"an ambitious target\".</p><p>The energy suppliers have already started to look at ways to prevent or minimise the damage of any cap. Centrica (CNA) led the charge late last year with a raft of proposals both for how it would reform (eg by withdrawing the SVT for new customers) and how the government should adapt (eg by funding renewable subsidies through general taxation rather than through bills, as it is currently). SSE (SSE) took a different approach, proposing to demerge from its household energy supply business, combining it with rival NPower and listing it as a new company, thereby exiting the market.</p><p>There is a real possibility the cap will not come into effect until 2019, meaning it could potentially last less than two years. Despite this, the impact of this legislation is already being felt, as the share prices of Centrica and SSE demonstrate. Both can be expected to suffer once a cap is in place, unless SSE manages to leave the household supply market as it plans to. Approach the sector with caution. TD</p><p>'Data governance is just one among a raft of statutes affecting sectors from telecoms to energy suppliers. Some have already come into effect. Others may be delayed as lawmakers negotiate with industry leaders' ;  ;</p><p>'Mifid II has been designed to create greater transparency and resilience within financial financial markets, injecting more competition, as well as protecting investors'  ;  ;</p><p>'Electronic and mobile payment methods have both facilitated and been spurred on by the stratospheric rise of global e-commerce' ;  ;</p><p>'One of the greatest concerns about cryptocurrency is its anonymity, rendering its origins - and potential facilitation of crime - difficult to trace'  ;  ;</p><p>'Data sharing has brought many benefits to consumers, but it has also prompted global concerns about privacy.

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 'devs' like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness'\", wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development week was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/facebook-gave-huawei-access-to-user-data-20180606-p4zjpn.html\">privacy crises this week.</url></p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over big giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p> The rise, fall and resurgence of Apple </p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the 90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey.</p><p>The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it. Macqaurie described it as \"the single most important driver of growth\" in Apple's services revenue over the past decade.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, declared at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have now generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he claimed.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store).</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment.</p><p>It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark.</p><p>Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties.</p><p>Such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p> Tech-lash </p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments.</p><p>In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-and-google-are-struggling-to-put-the-fake-news-genie-back-in-the-bottle-20171004-gytxxl.html\">spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US</url> and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy commonsense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\" the two investors, which together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkdifferentlyaboutkids.com/open-letter.php?acc=1\">said in a letter</url> to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick-up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second missive to the company this week.</p><p>\"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent imitative , and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>With Apple's global cultural influence, this is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC18</url></p><p>??? Arianna Huffington (@ariannahuff) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/1003730645099696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2018</url></p><p>\"[T]his is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p> Privacy wars </p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do.</p><p>On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive mind knowledge going on.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-screen-time/index.html\">interview with CNN</url>, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/facebook-says-310-000-australian-users-may-have-been-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-20180405-p4z7tm.html\">which affected as many 310,000 Australians,</url> and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016).</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/why-we-disagree-with-the-nyt/\">has denied</url> the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships, which were struck a decade ago, existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-privacy-bug.html\">software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</url></p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Abobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But his underlying argument - don't blame Apple for that - was clear. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>Yet taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns the Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from these risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't have a stranglehold over the smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android Platform<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">consistently outnumber</url> it.</p><p>And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520031256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHB-4271-JBJ7-N43R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2416\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness'\", wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development week was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/facebook-gave-huawei-access-to-user-data-20180606-p4zjpn.html\">privacy crises this week.</url></p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over big giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p> The rise, fall and resurgence of Apple </p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the 90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey.</p><p>The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it. Macqaurie described it as \"the single most important driver of growth\" in Apple's services revenue over the past decade.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, declared at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have now generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he claimed.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store).</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment.</p><p>It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark.</p><p>Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties. Such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p> Tech-lash </p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments.</p><p>In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-and-google-are-struggling-to-put-the-fake-news-genie-back-in-the-bottle-20171004-gytxxl.html\">spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US</url> and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy commonsense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\" the two investors, which together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkdifferentlyaboutkids.com/open-letter.php?acc=1\">said in a letter</url> to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick-up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second missive to the company this week.</p><p>\"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent initiative, and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>With Apple's global cultural influence, this is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC18</url></p><p>??? Arianna Huffington (@ariannahuff) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/1003730645099696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2018</url></p><p>\"[T]his is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p> Privacy wars </p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do.</p><p>On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive mind knowledge going on.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-screen-time/index.html\">interview with CNN</url>, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/facebook-says-310-000-australian-users-may-have-been-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-20180405-p4z7tm.html\">which affected as many 310,000 Australians,</url> and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016).</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/why-we-disagree-with-the-nyt/\">has denied</url> the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships, which were struck a decade ago, existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-privacy-bug.html\">software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</url></p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Abobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p> Leadership role </p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But his underlying argument - don't blame Apple for that - was clear. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>Yet taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns the Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from these risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't have a stranglehold over the smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android Platform<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">consistently outnumber</url> it.</p><p>And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520031256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHH-XJ11-JBJ7-N1YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2419\"/><timeReceived>07:51 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 'devs' like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness'\", wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/facebook-gave-huawei-access-to-user-data-20180606-p4zjpn.html\">privacy crises this week.</url></p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over giant screens.

Macqaurie described it as \"the single most important driver of growth\" in Apple's services revenue over the past decade.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, declared at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have now generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he claimed.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store).</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment.</p><p>It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark.</p><p>Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties. Such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p> Tech-lash </p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments.</p><p>In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-and-google-are-struggling-to-put-the-fake-news-genie-back-in-the-bottle-20171004-gytxxl.html\">spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US</url> and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy commonsense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\" the two investors, which together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkdifferentlyaboutkids.com/open-letter.php?acc=1\">said in a letter</url> to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick-up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second missive to the company this week.</p><p>\"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent initiative, and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>With Apple's global cultural influence, this is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC18</url></p><p>??? Arianna Huffington (@ariannahuff) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/1003730645099696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2018</url></p><p>\"[T]his is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p> Privacy wars </p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do.</p><p>On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive mind knowledge going on.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-screen-time/index.html\">interview with CNN</url>, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/facebook-says-310-000-australian-users-may-have-been-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-20180405-p4z7tm.html\">which affected as many 310,000 Australians,</url> and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016).</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/why-we-disagree-with-the-nyt/\">has denied</url> the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships, which were struck a decade ago, existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-privacy-bug.html\">software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</url></p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Abobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p> Leadership role </p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But his underlying argument - don't blame Apple for that - was clear. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>Yet taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns the Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from these risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't have a stranglehold over the smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android Platform<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">consistently outnumber</url> it.</p><p>And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520031256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHR-NGG1-DY19-C2W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2417\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 'devs' like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness'\", wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development week was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/facebook-gave-huawei-access-to-user-data-20180606-p4zjpn.html\">privacy crises this week.</url></p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over big giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p> The rise, fall and resurgence of Apple </p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the 90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey.</p><p>The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it. Macqaurie described it as \"the single most important driver of growth\" in Apple's services revenue over the past decade.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, declared at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have now generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he claimed.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store).</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment.</p><p>It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark.</p><p>Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties.</p><p>Such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p> Tech-lash </p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments.</p><p>In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-and-google-are-struggling-to-put-the-fake-news-genie-back-in-the-bottle-20171004-gytxxl.html\">spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US</url> and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy commonsense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\" the two investors, which together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkdifferentlyaboutkids.com/open-letter.php?acc=1\">said in a letter</url> to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick-up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second missive to the company this week.</p><p>\"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent imitative , and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>With Apple's global cultural influence, this is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC18</url></p><p>???

It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do.</p><p>On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive mind knowledge going on.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-screen-time/index.html\">interview with CNN</url>, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/facebook-says-310-000-australian-users-may-have-been-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-20180405-p4z7tm.html\">which affected as many 310,000 Australians,</url> and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016).</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/why-we-disagree-with-the-nyt/\">has denied</url> the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships, which were struck a decade ago, existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-privacy-bug.html\">software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</url></p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Abobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But his underlying argument - don't blame Apple for that - was clear. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>Yet taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns the Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from these risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't have a stranglehold over the smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android Platform<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">consistently outnumber</url> it.</p><p>And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520031256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHB-4271-JBJ7-N44B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2416\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 'devs' like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness'\", wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/facebook-gave-huawei-access-to-user-data-20180606-p4zjpn.html\">privacy crises this week.</url></p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p> The rise, fall and resurgence of Apple</p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the 90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey.</p><p>The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it. Macqaurie described it as \"the single most important driver of growth\" in Apple's services revenue over the past decade.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, declared at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have now generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he claimed.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store).</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment.</p><p>It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark.</p><p>Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties. Such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p> Tech-lash </p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments.</p><p>In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-and-google-are-struggling-to-put-the-fake-news-genie-back-in-the-bottle-20171004-gytxxl.html\">spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US</url> and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy commonsense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\" the two investors, which together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkdifferentlyaboutkids.com/open-letter.php?acc=1\">said in a letter</url> to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick-up and look at them) and the apps that run on them.

Arianna Huffington (@ariannahuff) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/1003730645099696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2018</url></p><p>\"[T]his is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p> Privacy wars </p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do.</p><p>On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive mind knowledge going on.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-screen-time/index.html\">interview with CNN</url>, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/facebook-says-310-000-australian-users-may-have-been-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-scandal-20180405-p4z7tm.html\">which affected as many 310,000 Australians,</url> and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016).</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge.</p><p>Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/why-we-disagree-with-the-nyt/\">has denied</url> the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships, which were struck a decade ago, existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-privacy-bug.html\">software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</url></p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Abobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p> Leadership role </p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But his underlying argument - don't blame Apple for that - was clear. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>Yet taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns the Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from these risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't have a stranglehold over the smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android Platform <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os\">consistently outnumber</url> it.</p><p>And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520031256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHR-NGG1-DY19-C2VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2417\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p>At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 \"devs\" like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness',\" wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development of the week was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of privacy crises this week.</p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over big giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>KEEPING YOUR BROWSING PRIVATE</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the '90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey. The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, said at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he said.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store.)</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second-biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment. It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark. Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties, such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments. In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>avoiding the tech backlash</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 per cent reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy common sense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\", the two investors, who together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, said in a letter to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second letter to the company this week. \"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent imitative , and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>\"This is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do. On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long-established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white-hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive-mind knowledge going on.'</p><p>cook argues for regulation Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an interview with CNN, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, which affected as many as 310,000 Australians, and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016.)</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge. Facebook has denied the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Adobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But don't blame Apple for that. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>But taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns The Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from regulatory risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't exactly dominate he smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android platform consistently outperform it. And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion-dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc70hp998t5iha7pykn0o</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHB-49F1-JD34-V4Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

And this week the company, which has a dominant position in Australia's smartphone and wearable device markets, revealed what might get it over the finish line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To some extent, it is the opposite of what you might expect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is interesting to hear a company say 'we want to limit use of our product',\" Claire d'Este, a Hobart-based software engineer from Savage Interactive, told Fairfax Media this week on the sidelines of an Apple event in California. \"It takes confidence to do that.\"</p><p>At its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose this week, Apple unveiled new tools to help people use iPhones less frequently than they currently do. It also announced new measures to block social media companies from tracking and building profiles on its users as they surf the internet.</p><p>In doing so, it directly addressed two of the biggest concerns swirling around the tech industry at the moment; and disarmed its biggest critics within the investment community, who have taken aim at the company on ethical grounds.</p><p>Apple has also pitted itself directly against Facebook and Google in a fierce ideological battle over privacy - and for the soul of the internet.</p><p>WWDC, Apple's biggest event of the year, is designed for developers, like d'Este, who helps build Procreate, a digital illustration app for the iPad. About 5000 \"devs\" like her made the trek to Northern California for the event this week.</p><p>Yet one of Apple's other constituencies - its investors - appear to be the week's big winners.</p><p>Apple shares climbed to fresh highs as WWDC took place, pushing its market value to within a smidgen of the arbitrary yet still historic $US1 trillion mark ($1.3 trillion). In comparison, Facebook is worth about $US560 billion and Google $US784 billion.</p><p>That is to say, the company's new initiatives were well received by Wall Street. \"Apple is clearly committed to the idea that it is different from its competitors in terms of its outlook on privacy and user 'wellness',\" wrote Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter.</p><p>Rival consumer tech companies are no doubt less thrilled by the week's proceedings.</p><p>Arguably the most striking development of the week was Apple's barely disguised disdain for Facebook, and what it sees as a cavalier approach to privacy from the social media behemoth.</p><p>In its keynote presentation this week, Apple made a string of not so subtle references to Facebook, which has been beset by another series of privacy crises this week.</p><p>As attendees entered the hall for the keynote address, they were greeted, as is custom, with a \"wall of apps\" emblazoned over big giant screens. The wall pointedly excluded Facebook - the most popular free app on smartphones in the world.</p><p>Later, Apple unveiled ScreenTime, its new feature that will help users (and parents) monitor usage of the iPhones and the apps that run on them. \"Some apps demand more of our attention than we even realise,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's top engineering executive said at the conference. \"It's become such a habit we might not even realise how distracted we have become.\"</p><p>The example of an app that can now be tracked and monitored Apple chose to use? Instagram - owned by Facebook.</p><p>Then Apple unveiled new features in the Safari browser that will block ad-tech companies from tracking users, building detailed profiles of them, and serving them creepy ads as they surf the internet.</p><p>KEEPING YOUR BROWSING PRIVATE</p><p>Social media sharing buttons and comment fields could be used by such companies to collect data, Apple claimed. \"We're shutting that down,\" Federighi said.</p><p>Again, the example Apple chose to use as a site that does that type of thing, which could now be stopped, was instructive: Facebook.com.</p><p>The rise of Apple under Steve Jobs in the 1980s, fall of the company in the '90s when he was ousted, and its resurgence upon his return in the 2000s, has been (very) well documented</p><p>It was Jobs' unyielding vision for the iPhone that propelled Apple into the corporate stratosphere. Less discussed is the role the software on those devices - made both by the company and by third party developers - played in that journey. The App Store, which will turn 10 next month, has become one of Apple's most effective strategic weapons, and a lucrative earner for both the company and hordes of other companies building apps for it.</p><p>\"In those 10 years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO and Jobs' successor, said at WWDC this week. \"It's enabled countless new companies, it's created tens of millions of new jobs, and spawned entirely new industries.\"</p><p>Third party developers, around 5000 of whom made the trek to San Jose this week, including d'Este, have generated more than $US100 billion in earnings from the App Store over that period, he said.</p><p>That works out to be about $US14 billion annually in revenue for Apple from the App Store, according to Goldman Sachs. (Apple takes a cut on all transactions and subscriptions in the App Store.)</p><p>'Software and services' has become Apple's second-biggest business behind the iPhone, and last quarter, it was the company's fastest-growing segment. It helps explain why some analysts believe software is the key to Apple's future growth.</p><p>Without getting too deep into the investment weeds, some investors are willing to ascribe higher multiples to revenue that is recurring. It has been estimated that about a third of the revenue in the App Store comes from subscriptions. In other words, software is a big part of why Apple is now eyeing off the $US1 trillion market cap mark. Yet software and apps have also caused it headaches over the years. At times this has included its own software (for example, its Maps product, which was widely lambasted when it launched).</p><p>At other times it has been apps made by external parties, such as Google and Facebook, who have been at the centre of growing resentment towards the tech industry, and were the subtext to Apple's messaging this week.</p><p>The tech industry has been experiencing a significant backlash from politicians and the media around the world over the past couple of years.</p><p>A variety of factors have contributed to this. Tech companies are now among the most valuable and powerful entities on the planet, with billions of users and more cash than some national governments. In the US, there are concerns the industry has contributed to income inequality. There are also fears that some tech companies have undermined democracy.</p><p>Facebook and Google utterly failed to stem the spread of fake news during the 2016 elections in the US and during the Brexit vote in the UK. Both have also struggled to contain hate speech and other forms of disagreeable content on their platforms.</p><p>avoiding the tech backlash</p><p>Apple has largely avoided the tech backlash. Largely, but not entirely.</p><p>The company was criticised in some quarters for a dispute in 2015 with the FBI over encryption, involving a device used by a mass shooter. It has also been criticised for its elaborate tax minimisation schemes over the years.</p><p>Earlier this year, two of Apple's own investors raised concerns about excessive iPhone use. Jana Investment Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System cited research claiming the average American teenager spent over 4.5 hours each day on their phone (and that excludes texting and talking); that 78 per cent of teens check their phones at least hourly, and that 50 per cent reported feeling \"addicted\" to them.</p><p>\"It would defy common sense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact\", the two investors, who together hold $2 billion in Apple stock, said in a letter to the company.</p><p>But Apple's \"digital wellness\" updates this week, including ScreenTime, a dashboard feature it had quietly worked on for about a year, appear to have defused their concerns.</p><p>ScreenTime will give iPhone users the ability to get detailed data on how they use their phones (as granular as how often they pick up and look at them) and the apps that run on them. They will be able to lock certain apps once certain usage thresholds have been met. Parents will able to use the feature for their kids.</p><p>Jana and CalSRTS seemed convinced by the initiative. \"Given that we openly discussed the shortcomings of Apple's controls in our first letter, we want to be equally open today in commending you for your boldness and thoughtfulness in rethinking them\" they wrote in a second letter to the company this week. \"We trust that Apple will be equally committed in your follow-through.\"</p><p>Other figures in the digital wellness movement, such as Tristan Harris, a former Googler who has founded the Time Well Spent imitative , and Ariana Huffington, a publishing magnate who has championed these issues, echoed similar sentiments.</p><p>\"This is going to dramatically accelerate a shift from a world that values constant connectivity at all costs to one that values unplugging, recharging and reducing noise and distractions,\" Huffington wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Yet just after Apple announced ScreenTime at WWDC it segued into 'Memoji's' - a feature that will allow users to create emojis that look like themselves. It was strikingly incongruous from what preceded it, and shows that Apple still has work to do. On the other big ethical issue swirling around the tech industry - privacy - the company doubled down on its long-established position.</p><p>\"Apple always takes a really proactive approach to privacy and to respecting people's data,\" Nic Wittison, an engineer from white-hot Sydney design app Canva, told Fairfax at WWDC.</p><p>\"Everything is always [stored] on device, they never do anything [sensitive] in the cloud. It causes other problems, but it also means everything is secure, and you don't have to worry about that kind of, hive-mind knowledge going on.'</p><p>cook argues for regulation Apple's Cook spent much of the week talking up his company's privacy credentials, and throwing shade at Facebook and Google. In an interview with CNN, he said regulation of tech companies would be \"fair\" because \"this privacy thing has gotten out of control\".</p><p>It came as Facebook was engulfed in more privacy scandals that could conceivably end up being even worse for it than the Cambridge Analytica episode that rocked the company to its core earlier this year.</p><p>(That scandal, which affected as many as 310,000 Australians, and has resulted in an investigation by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, involved data of users unwittingly being shared with a political consultancy that worked on the Trump and Brexit campaigns in 2016.)</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing partnerships with handset makers that could allow data of Facebook users (and their friends) to be shared without their knowledge. Facebook has denied the essence of the report. It says the data sharing was tightly controlled and no one's information was used without their knowledge.</p><p>But it admitted the partnerships existed. Participating handset makers included Apple (which itself denied seeking any intimate data about Facebook users) and China's Huawei.</p><p>The latter revelation added a geopolitical element to a story that was already veering out of control for Facebook. Tensions in the US toward China, and Chinese technology companies, are rising.</p><p>Its a similar story here in Australia. The upshot is that lawmakers in both countries (including our own Prime Minister) have spent the past couple of days talking about Facebook and privacy.</p><p>Then, to add insult to injury, on Friday morning, Facebook confirmed a software bug could mean up to 14 million of its users publicly shared information designed to be private.</p><p>Apple has clashed with other big tech companies over the years. Steve Jobs was famously full of contempt towards Google (he wanted to launch a \"holy war\" against the search giant, according to court documents) and vociferously attacked Adobe's Flash software.</p><p>Under Cook the company has taken a more measured approach. That changed this week. From Cook and Apple's perspective, the decision to publicly chastise Facebook couldn't have been better timed.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Facebook, on the back foot and under fire, attempts to fight back.</p><p>In the CNN interview, Cook admitted that even he uses his iPhone too much. But don't blame Apple for that. \"The device is not addictive in and of itself,\" Cook told CNN. \"It's what you do on it.\"</p><p>Whether the new commitment to digital wellness and the focus on privacy issues boost Apple's underlying sales of iPhones, iPads and Apple watches remains to be seen. Investors seem to think that is possible, based on the market reaction this week.</p><p>But taking a leadership role in digital wellness and privacy could be smart for other reasons.</p><p>The risks of regulation for most of Apple's rivals in US tech for race for the $US1 trillion crown are rising. Facebook (worth $US560 billion at press time) and Google ($US784 billion) are at risk of regulation for reasons we've discussed throughout this piece, and for their dominant, monopoly-like positions in social media and search advertising markets.</p><p>Amazon is at risk too because of its strong position on e-commerce and broader US retail, and because the Trump administration simply doesn't like the company. (Its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, personally owns The Washington Post, which has clashed with Trump on many big stories).</p><p>Only Microsoft (worth $US775 billion) seems relatively immune from regulatory risks, in part because it has already been through that process.</p><p>Meanwhile, nobody is seriously talking about breaking up Apple. Despite being so enormous and profitable, it doesn't exactly dominate he smartphone market - devices that operate on Google's Android platform consistently outperform it. And at the moment, at least, it is in the good books with the Trump administration.</p><p>All of which is to say that the race to a trillion-dollar valuation is Apple's to lose.</p><p>The writer attended WWDC as a guest of Apple</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc70hp5xto58g1kpentn0n</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHB-20J1-JD34-V42K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

His chalkboard menu tempts customers with danish pastries, french fancies and Italian coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He does not offer the Dutch sandwich or the double Irish - but is beginning to think he should. \"I pay 23% business tax. Starbucks next door pays almost nothing. It's not fair,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dutch sandwich and the double Irish describe complex methods multinational firms use to avoid tax. Most of the profits Starbucks, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - and many other companies - make in Britain are routed to Holland, Luxembourg and Ireland to take advantage of those countries' lower tax rates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, they can pay as little as 1% on the billions of pounds of revenues they generate in Britain.</p><p>Last week, however, the big firms' tax avoidance came back to bite them, after one of Google's former employees disclosed how UK sales were being booked in Ireland to avoid tax.</p><p>Barney Jones, 34, a former executive, told The Sunday Times that online advertising sales had in fact been made in this country - and he believed tax should have been paid. The real victims, he said, were ordinary taxpayers.</p><p>The growing row prompted pledges from the party leaders to crack down on tax avoidance. David Cameron announced that he would make it a priority as he assumes the chairmanship of the group of eight leading economies.</p><p>Ed Miliband accused Google, whose corporate motto is \"Don't be evil\", of acting unethically - in a speech at its own \"big tent\" event in Hertfordshire.</p><p>While Google faced British brickbats, Apple was in the stocks in America. A US Senate committee last week accused the company of seeking the holy grail of tax avoidance, creating \"offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere\".</p><p>Late last week the tech giants fought back, insisting that they comply with all tax laws and pay \"extraordinary\" amounts of tax. They are now joining politicians in calling for an overhaul of the global tax system.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, said: \"I can't defend the international tax regime. I did not design such an irrational structure.\"</p><p>HOW did we get into this mess? And more importantly, how can we encourage, cajole or force the multinationals to pay their fair dues? There is nothing new about tax havens: companies, institutions and private individuals have been using them for more than 100 years.</p><p>Recently, however, many firms have begun to exploit these havens more aggressively.</p><p>The sums of tax that companies and wealthy individuals avoid has been growing by 15% a year for the past decade. Today, up to $32 trillion is held offshore. Tax avoidance costs the UK tens of billions of pounds a year.</p><p>Thanks to the increasing globalisation of trade, multinational corporations find it ever easier to shuttle profits - and sometimes even their headquarters - around the globe in search of the jurisdiction willing to cut them the best tax deal.</p><p>Much of this is done using \"transfer pricing\", in which one subsidiary of a multinational sells products and services to another subsidiary often at an artificial price in order to make profits seem higher in a low-tax country - and lower in a high-tax one.</p><p>This process is helped by the changing nature of what many firms sell: a large slice of the revenues of Google, Apple and Amazon come from intangible products such as electronic books, MP3 files and computer games.</p><p>It is easy to set up a company in a low-tax country and process sales of \"virtual\" items or collect fees or royalties for the use of an idea.</p><p>Google had turnover of \u00a32.7bn in the UK in 2011. It catapults those revenues around the world, from Holland to Ireland to Bermuda, to minimise tax liabilities. It paid just \u00a36m tax in 2011. Apple and Amazon operate similarly circuitous money flows. Together, the two companies had revenues of about \u00a310bn in the UK in 2011 but paid less than \u00a317m in tax.</p><p>Last November Matt Brittin, a Google vice-president, justified his company's tax arrangements to a parliamentary committee on the grounds that it did not sell advertising in this country. Some former Google sales executives were mystified by the claim.</p><p>Brittin subsequently clarified his remarks to say sales were not concluded in this country, but the damage was done.</p><p>A Reuters investigation picked apart the claim that Google sales teams were not active in this country and last weekend Jones came forward to The Sunday Times.</p><p>He wielded a dossier of 100,000 emails and documents which he claimed proved Google advertising sales were conducted and concluded in the UK during his four years at the company. On Monday, he met officials from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and handed over the dossier.</p><p>\"Sales were being made in the UK and I suspect there might be a rather large tax bill for Google at the end of this,\" Jones said last week. \"I certainly hope the British taxpayers get some money back. \"It seems to me some of the largest companies have been running rings around HMRC. Someone needs to take proper charge of this issue.\"</p><p>The laceration of Apple's tax affairs by a US Senate committee helped further push the issue on to the global agenda.</p><p>The big tech firms seem to agree that tax codes are out of date and reform is needed. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, argued last week for a \"dramatic simplification\" of tax laws. Schmidt has also made clear he supports an overhaul of the global system.</p><p>British analysts agree. Richard Brooks, a former HMRC corporate tax inspector who quit eight years ago in disgust at what he saw as the authority's failure to tackle corporate tax avoidance, says: \"The basics of today's global tax rules were drawn up in the 1920s under the League of Nations. Since then, the authorities have not kept up with with telegraph and the telephone, let alone the internet.\" Regulation is \"as bad as regulation of the banks before the economic crisis\", he adds.</p><p>Even the man in charge of global tax policy at the OECD, the body that crafts international rules on taxation, Pascal Saint-Amans, says the system is rotten. \"Aggressive tax planning needs to be stopped with firmer rules,\" he says. But how? SOME hope big firms will see the damage the tax row is doing to their brand value and volunteer to pay more. Earlier this year, Starbucks agreed to add an extra \u00a310m shot of corporation tax to its 2013-14 accounts but no other firm has indicated it will follow suit.</p><p>There is also the possibility of consumer boycotts: a recent brand preference survey showed a drop in Starbucks' standing among coffee drinkers, which may explain a surge in sales for its British rival Costa.</p><p>Can politicians help? Cameron has been talking tough on tax reform, but critics say he has not been acting tough. Last week, he welcomed Schmidt, a member of the government's Business Advisory Group, to 10 Downing Street, but did not tackle the Google boss directly on his firm's tax avoidance.</p><p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has gone one better. He welcomed another taxavoiding tech titan, the Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, to No 11 last month, not to discuss tax but to host a champagne party to launch Lean In, her new book.</p><p>Brooks believes the government's own proposed reform of the controlled foreign company rules might even make it easier for big firms to avoid tax in future.</p><p>One reason for the politicians' failure to match their words with action appears to be a belief that low taxes encourage high investment.</p><p>\"I believe in low taxes for business, because we've got to encourage investment, and we''ve got to encourage jobs,\" Cameron said last week.</p><p>Also, despite widespread aggressive avoidance - and the recession - the corporation tax take in the UK is holding up (see table).</p><p>If, against the odds, politicians did get their act together, could they make real changes? Prem Sikka, a leading UK tax expert, argues global leaders could agree to treat multinational companies as a single global entity, instead of lots of different subsidiaries, and divide up their profits fairly country by country, according to where their real economic activity takes place. The firms would then pay whatever tax each country decided to levy.</p><p>This idea, called unitary taxation, is compellingly simple and the EU has agreed to force big firms to reveal corporate profits and taxes on a countryby-country basis.</p><p>But it would require governments to agree a global formula for dividing taxable profits \"fairly\".</p><p>Past experience suggests that, with so much at stake, this could be tricky.</p><p>Germany and France tried to pressure Ireland to give up its low 12.5% corporation tax by threatening to veto the (EURO)85bn EU bailout package for Dublin three years ago. But not even the threat of losing (EURO)85bn could persuade the Irish to budge. In the end, Paris and Berlin backed down.</p><p>Could one country act on its own? Miliband has pledged to change laws unilaterally to stop transfer pricing and clamp down on offshore tax havens.

His chalkboard menu tempts customers with danish pastries, french fancies and Italian coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He does not offer the Dutch sandwich or the double Irish - but is beginning to think he should. \"I pay 23% business tax. Starbucks next door pays almost nothing. It's not fair,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dutch sandwich and the double Irish describe complex methods multinational firms use to avoid tax. Most of the profits Starbucks, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - and many other companies - make in Britain are routed to Holland, Luxembourg and Ireland to take advantage of those countries' lower tax rates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, they can pay as little as 1% on the billions of pounds of revenues they generate in Britain.</p><p>Last week, however, the big firms' tax avoidance came back to bite them, after one of Google's former employees disclosed how UK sales were being booked in Ireland to avoid tax.</p><p>Barney Jones, 34, a former executive, told The Sunday Times that online advertising sales had in fact been made in this country - and he believed tax should have been paid. The real victims, he said, were ordinary taxpayers.</p><p>The growing row prompted pledges from the party leaders to crack down on tax avoidance. David Cameron announced that he would make it a priority as he assumes the chairmanship of the group of eight leading economies.</p><p>Ed Miliband accused Google, whose corporate motto is \"Don't be evil\", of acting unethically - in a speech at its own \"big tent\" event in Hertfordshire.</p><p>While Google faced British brickbats, Apple was in the stocks in America. A US Senate committee last week accused the company of seeking the holy grail of tax avoidance, creating \"offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere\".</p><p>Late last week the tech giants fought back, insisting that they comply with all tax laws and pay \"extraordinary\" amounts of tax. They are now joining politicians in calling for an overhaul of the global tax system.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, said: \"I can't defend the international tax regime. I did not design such an irrational structure.\"</p><p>HOW did we get into this mess? And more importantly, how can we encourage, cajole or force the multinationals to pay their fair dues? There is nothing new about tax havens: companies, institutions and private individuals have been using them for more than 100 years.</p><p>Recently, however, many firms have begun to exploit these havens more aggressively.</p><p>The sums of tax that companies and wealthy individuals avoid has been growing by 15% a year for the past decade. Today, up to $32 trillion is held offshore. Tax avoidance costs the UK tens of billions of pounds a year.</p><p>Thanks to the increasing globalisation of trade, multinational corporations find it ever easier to shuttle profits - and sometimes even their headquarters - around the globe in search of the jurisdiction willing to cut them the best tax deal.</p><p>Much of this is done using \"transfer pricing\", in which one subsidiary of a multinational sells products and services to another subsidiary often at an artificial price in order to make profits seem higher in a low-tax country - and lower in a high-tax one.</p><p>This process is helped by the changing nature of what many firms sell: a large slice of the revenues of Google, Apple and Amazon come from intangible products such as electronic books, MP3 files and computer games.</p><p>It is easy to set up a company in a low-tax country and process sales of \"virtual\" items or collect fees or royalties for the use of an idea.</p><p>Google had turnover of \u00a32.7bn in the UK in 2011. It catapults those revenues around the world, from Holland to Ireland to Bermuda, to minimise tax liabilities. It paid just \u00a36m tax in 2011. Apple and Amazon operate similarly circuitous money flows. Together, the two companies had revenues of about \u00a310bn in the UK in 2011 but paid less than \u00a317m in tax.</p><p>Last November Matt Brittin, a Google vice-president, justified his company's tax arrangements to a parliamentary committee on the grounds that it did not sell advertising in this country. Some former Google sales executives were mystified by the claim.</p><p>Brittin subsequently clarified his remarks to say sales were not concluded in this country, but the damage was done.</p><p>A Reuters investigation picked apart the claim that Google sales teams were not active in this country and last weekend Jones came forward to The Sunday Times.</p><p>He wielded a dossier of 100,000 emails and documents which he claimed proved Google advertising sales were conducted and concluded in the UK during his four years at the company. On Monday, he met officials from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and handed over the dossier.</p><p>\"Sales were being made in the UK and I suspect there might be a rather large tax bill for Google at the end of this,\" Jones said last week. \"I certainly hope the British taxpayers get some money back. \"It seems to me some of the largest companies have been running rings around HMRC. Someone needs to take proper charge of this issue.\"</p><p>The laceration of Apple's tax affairs by a US Senate committee helped further push the issue on to the global agenda.</p><p>The big tech firms seem to agree that tax codes are out of date and reform is needed. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, argued last week for a \"dramatic simplification\" of tax laws. Schmidt has also made clear he supports an overhaul of the global system.</p><p>British analysts agree. Richard Brooks, a former HMRC corporate tax inspector who quit eight years ago in disgust at what he saw as the authority's failure to tackle corporate tax avoidance, says: \"The basics of today's global tax rules were drawn up in the 1920s under the League of Nations. Since then, the authorities have not kept up with with telegraph and the telephone, let alone the internet.\" Regulation is \"as bad as regulation of the banks before the economic crisis\", he adds.</p><p>Even the man in charge of global tax policy at the OECD, the body that crafts international rules on taxation, Pascal Saint-Amans, says the system is rotten. \"Aggressive tax planning needs to be stopped with firmer rules,\" he says. But how? SOME hope big firms will see the damage the tax row is doing to their brand value and volunteer to pay more. Earlier this year, Starbucks agreed to add an extra \u00a310m shot of corporation tax to its 2013-14 accounts but no other firm has indicated it will follow suit.</p><p>There is also the possibility of consumer boycotts: a recent brand preference survey showed a drop in Starbucks' standing among coffee drinkers, which may explain a surge in sales for its British rival Costa.</p><p>Can politicians help? Cameron has been talking tough on tax reform, but critics say he has not been acting tough. Last week, he welcomed Schmidt, a member of the government's Business Advisory Group, to 10 Downing Street, but did not tackle the Google boss directly on his firm's tax avoidance.</p><p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has gone one better. He welcomed another taxavoiding tech titan, the Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, to No 11 last month, not to discuss tax but to host a champagne party to launch Lean In, her new book.</p><p>Brooks believes the government's own proposed reform of the controlled foreign company rules might even make it easier for big firms to avoid tax in future.</p><p>One reason for the politicians' failure to match their words with action appears to be a belief that low taxes encourage high investment.</p><p>\"I believe in low taxes for business, because we've got to encourage investment, and we''ve got to encourage jobs,\" Cameron said last week.</p><p>Also, despite widespread aggressive avoidance - and the recession - the corporation tax take in the UK is holding up (see table).</p><p>If, against the odds, politicians did get their act together, could they make real changes? Prem Sikka, a leading UK tax expert, argues global leaders could agree to treat multinational companies as a single global entity, instead of lots of different subsidiaries, and divide up their profits fairly country by country, according to where their real economic activity takes place. The firms would then pay whatever tax each country decided to levy.</p><p>This idea, called unitary taxation, is compellingly simple and the EU has agreed to force big firms to reveal corporate profits and taxes on a countryby-country basis.</p><p>But it would require governments to agree a global formula for dividing taxable profits \"fairly\".</p><p>Past experience suggests that, with so much at stake, this could be tricky.</p><p>Germany and France tried to pressure Ireland to give up its low 12.5% corporation tax by threatening to veto the (EURO)85bn EU bailout package for Dublin three years ago. But not even the threat of losing (EURO)85bn could persuade the Irish to budge. In the end, Paris and Berlin backed down.</p><p>Could one country act on its own? Miliband has pledged to change laws unilaterally to stop transfer pricing and clamp down on offshore tax havens. Nick Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands and a leading expert on offshore finance, says: \"Labour could quite easily close some of the tax loopholes firms now exploit.\"</p><p>But forcing a multinational such as Google to declare all the sales it makes in Britain in Britain, rather than in Ireland, would involve renegotiating the UK's tax treaty with Dublin. And even if that happened, Google could simply route its British profits through another tax haven, say, Luxembourg.</p><p>Brooks, author of The Great Tax Robbery, admits: \"There are things that, in theory, you could do to stop tax avoidance but they require global agreements which are, in practice, very difficult to get.\"</p><p>Nobody underestimates the scale of the challenge in reaching such agreements, but there is undoubtedly growing support among corporations, government - and the public - for reform.</p><p>A successful resolution would ensure a fairer and more transparent system.

His chalkboard menu tempts customers with danish pastries, french fancies and Italian coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He does not offer the Dutch sandwich or the double Irish - but is beginning to think he should. \"I pay 23% business tax. Starbucks next door pays almost nothing. It's not fair,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dutch sandwich and the double Irish describe complex methods multinational firms use to avoid tax. Most of the profits Starbucks, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - and many other companies - make in Britain are routed to Holland, Luxembourg and Ireland to take advantage of those countries' lower tax rates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, they can pay as little as 1% on the billions of pounds of revenues they generate in Britain.</p><p>Last week, however, the big firms' tax avoidance came back to bite them, after one of Google's former employees disclosed how UK sales were being booked in Ireland to avoid tax.</p><p>Barney Jones, 34, a former executive, told The Sunday Times that online advertising sales had in fact been made in this country - and he believed tax should have been paid. The real victims, he said, were ordinary taxpayers.</p><p>The growing row prompted pledges from the party leaders to crack down on tax avoidance. David Cameron announced that he would make it a priority as he assumes the chairmanship of the group of eight leading economies.</p><p>Ed Miliband accused Google, whose corporate motto is \"Don't be evil\", of acting unethically - in a speech at its own \"big tent\" event in Hertfordshire.</p><p>While Google faced British brickbats, Apple was in the stocks in America. A US Senate committee last week accused the company of seeking the holy grail of tax avoidance, creating \"offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere\".</p><p>Late last week the tech giants fought back, insisting that they comply with all tax laws and pay \"extraordinary\" amounts of tax. They are now joining politicians in calling for an overhaul of the global tax system.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, said: \"I can't defend the international tax regime. I did not design such an irrational structure.\"</p><p>HOW did we get into this mess? And more importantly, how can we encourage, cajole or force the multinationals to pay their fair dues? There is nothing new about tax havens: companies, institutions and private individuals have been using them for more than 100 years.</p><p>Recently, however, many firms have begun to exploit these havens more aggressively.</p><p>The sums of tax that companies and wealthy individuals avoid has been growing by 15% a year for the past decade. Today, up to $32 trillion is held offshore. Tax avoidance costs the UK tens of billions of pounds a year.</p><p>Thanks to the increasing globalisation of trade, multinational corporations find it ever easier to shuttle profits - and sometimes even their headquarters - around the globe in search of the jurisdiction willing to cut them the best tax deal.</p><p>Much of this is done using \"transfer pricing\", in which one subsidiary of a multinational sells products and services to another subsidiary often at an artificial price in order to make profits seem higher in a low-tax country - and lower in a high-tax one.</p><p>This process is helped by the changing nature of what many firms sell: a large slice of the revenues of Google, Apple and Amazon come from intangible products such as electronic books, MP3 files and computer games.</p><p>It is easy to set up a company in a low-tax country and process sales of \"virtual\" items or collect fees or royalties for the use of an idea.</p><p>Google had turnover of \u00a32.7bn in the UK in 2011. It catapults those revenues around the world, from Holland to Ireland to Bermuda, to minimise tax liabilities. It paid just \u00a36m tax in 2011. Apple and Amazon operate similarly circuitous money flows. Together, the two companies had revenues of about \u00a310bn in the UK in 2011 but paid less than \u00a317m in tax.</p><p>Last November Matt Brittin, a Google vice-president, justified his company's tax arrangements to a parliamentary committee on the grounds that it did not sell advertising in this country. Some former Google sales executives were mystified by the claim.</p><p>Brittin subsequently clarified his remarks to say sales were not concluded in this country, but the damage was done.</p><p>A Reuters investigation picked apart the claim that Google sales teams were not active in this country and last weekend Jones came forward to The Sunday Times.</p><p>He wielded a dossier of 100,000 emails and documents which he claimed proved Google advertising sales were conducted and concluded in the UK during his four years at the company. On Monday, he met officials from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and handed over the dossier.</p><p>\"Sales were being made in the UK and I suspect there might be a rather large tax bill for Google at the end of this,\" Jones said last week. \"I certainly hope the British taxpayers get some money back. \"It seems to me some of the largest companies have been running rings around HMRC. Someone needs to take proper charge of this issue.\"</p><p>The laceration of Apple's tax affairs by a US Senate committee helped further push the issue on to the global agenda.</p><p>The big tech firms seem to agree that tax codes are out of date and reform is needed. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, argued last week for a \"dramatic simplification\" of tax laws. Schmidt has also made clear he supports an overhaul of the global system.</p><p>British analysts agree. Richard Brooks, a former HMRC corporate tax inspector who quit eight years ago in disgust at what he saw as the authority's failure to tackle corporate tax avoidance, says: \"The basics of today's global tax rules were drawn up in the 1920s under the League of Nations. Since then, the authorities have not kept up with with telegraph and the telephone, let alone the internet.\" Regulation is \"as bad as regulation of the banks before the economic crisis\", he adds.</p><p>Even the man in charge of global tax policy at the OECD, the body that crafts international rules on taxation, Pascal Saint-Amans, says the system is rotten. \"Aggressive tax planning needs to be stopped with firmer rules,\" he says. But how? SOME hope big firms will see the damage the tax row is doing to their brand value and volunteer to pay more. Earlier this year, Starbucks agreed to add an extra \u00a310m shot of corporation tax to its 2013-14 accounts but no other firm has indicated it will follow suit.</p><p>There is also the possibility of consumer boycotts: a recent brand preference survey showed a drop in Starbucks' standing among coffee drinkers, which may explain a surge in sales for its British rival Costa.</p><p>Can politicians help? Cameron has been talking tough on tax reform, but critics say he has not been acting tough. Last week, he welcomed Schmidt, a member of the government's Business Advisory Group, to 10 Downing Street, but did not tackle the Google boss directly on his firm's tax avoidance.</p><p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has gone one better. He welcomed another taxavoiding tech titan, the Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, to No 11 last month, not to discuss tax but to host a champagne party to launch Lean In, her new book.</p><p>Brooks believes the government's own proposed reform of the controlled foreign company rules might even make it easier for big firms to avoid tax in future.</p><p>One reason for the politicians' failure to match their words with action appears to be a belief that low taxes encourage high investment.</p><p>\"I believe in low taxes for business, because we've got to encourage investment, and we''ve got to encourage jobs,\" Cameron said last week.</p><p>Also, despite widespread aggressive avoidance - and the recession - the corporation tax take in the UK is holding up (see table).</p><p>If, against the odds, politicians did get their act together, could they make real changes? Prem Sikka, a leading UK tax expert, argues global leaders could agree to treat multinational companies as a single global entity, instead of lots of different subsidiaries, and divide up their profits fairly country by country, according to where their real economic activity takes place. The firms would then pay whatever tax each country decided to levy.</p><p>This idea, called unitary taxation, is compellingly simple and the EU has agreed to force big firms to reveal corporate profits and taxes on a countryby-country basis.</p><p>But it would require governments to agree a global formula for dividing taxable profits \"fairly\".</p><p>Past experience suggests that, with so much at stake, this could be tricky.</p><p>Germany and France tried to pressure Ireland to give up its low 12.5% corporation tax by threatening to veto the (EURO)85bn EU bailout package for Dublin three years ago. But not even the threat of losing (EURO)85bn could persuade the Irish to budge. In the end, Paris and Berlin backed down.</p><p>Could one country act on its own? Miliband has pledged to change laws unilaterally to stop transfer pricing and clamp down on offshore tax havens. Nick Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands and a leading expert on offshore finance, says: \"Labour could quite easily close some of the tax loopholes firms now exploit.\"</p><p>But forcing a multinational such as Google to declare all the sales it makes in Britain in Britain, rather than in Ireland, would involve renegotiating the UK's tax treaty with Dublin. And even if that happened, Google could simply route its British profits through another tax haven, say, Luxembourg.</p><p>Brooks, author of The Great Tax Robbery, admits: \"There are things that, in theory, you could do to stop tax avoidance but they require global agreements which are, in practice, very difficult to get.\"</p><p>Nobody underestimates the scale of the challenge in reaching such agreements, but there is undoubtedly growing support among corporations, government - and the public - for reform.</p><p>A successful resolution would ensure a fairer and more transparent system. For al-Najjar at the Surf 'n' Click coffee bar, the demise of the Dutch sandwich and an iniquitous global tax regime cannot come soon enough.</p><p>A tip for the untaxables: give your cash away, Adam Boulton, page 23.</p><p>Apple's rotten core, Business, page 5</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-72871849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58H4-69T1-DY9P-N3N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>May 26, 2013 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GROUP OF EIGHT (G8)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Scotland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Tax Avoidance &amp;

His chalkboard menu tempts customers with danish pastries, french fancies and Italian coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He does not offer the Dutch sandwich or the double Irish - but is beginning to think he should. \"I pay 23% business tax. Starbucks next door pays almost nothing. It's not fair,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dutch sandwich and the double Irish describe complex methods that multinational firms use to avoid tax. Most of the profits that Starbucks, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - and many other companies - make in Britain are routed to Holland, Luxembourg and Ireland to take advantage of the lower tax rates in those countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, they can pay as little as 1% on the billions of pounds of revenues they generate in Britain.</p><p>Last week, however, the big firms' tax avoidance came back to bite them after one of Google's former employees disclosed how UK sales were being booked in Ireland to avoid tax.</p><p>Barney Jones, 34, a former executive, told The Sunday Times that online advertising sales had in fact been made in this country - and he believed tax should have been paid. The real victims, he said, were ordinary taxpayers.</p><p>The growing row prompted pledges from the party leaders to crack down on tax avoidance.</p><p>David Cameron announced that he would make it a priority as he assumes the chairmanship of the G8, the group of eight leading economies.</p><p>Ed Miliband accused Google, whose corporate motto is \"Don't be evil\", of acting unethically - in a speech at Google's own \"big tent\" event in Hertfordshire.</p><p>While Google faced British brickbats, Apple was in the stocks in America. A US Senate committee last week accused the company of seeking the holy grail of tax avoidance, creating \"offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere\".</p><p>Last week the tech giants fought back, insisting that they comply with all tax laws and pay \"extraordinary\" amounts of tax. They are now joining politicians in calling for an overhaul of the global tax system. \"It's not up to the taxee to say how much to pay,\" Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, said last night. \"Figure out what taxes you want to charge us and we will pay them. The fact of the matter is: what we are doing is legal.\"</p><p>HOW did we get into this mess? And, more importantly, how can we encourage, cajole or force the multinationals to pay their fair dues? There is nothing new about tax havens: companies, institutions and private individuals have been using them for more than 100 years.</p><p>Recently many firms have begun to exploit these havens more aggressively. The sums of tax that companies and wealthy individuals avoid has been growing by 15% a year for the past decade. Today up to $32 trillion is held offshore. Tax avoidance costs the UK tens of billions of pounds a year.</p><p>Thanks to the increasing globalisation of trade, multinational corporations find it ever easier to shuttle profits - and sometimes headquarters - around the world in search of the jurisdiction willing to cut them the best tax deal.</p><p>Much of this is done using \"transfer pricing\" in which one subsidiary of a multinational sells products and services to another subsidiary, often at an artificial price to make profits seem higher in a low-tax country - and lower in a high-tax one.</p><p>This process is helped by the changing nature of what many firms sell: a large slice of the revenues of Google, Apple and Amazon come from intangible products such as electronic books, MP3 files and computer games.</p><p>It is easy to set up a company in a low-tax country and process the sales of \"virtual\" items or collect fees or royalties for the use of an idea.</p><p>Google had turnover of \u00a32.7bn in the UK in 2011. It catapults those revenues around the world, from Holland to Ireland to Bermuda, to minimise tax liabilities. It paid just \u00a36m tax in 2011. Apple and Amazon operate similarly circuitous money flows. Together these two companies had revenues of about \u00a310bn in the UK in 2011 but paid less than \u00a317m in tax.</p><p>Last November Matt Brittin, a Google vice-president, justified his company's tax arrangements to a parliamentary committee on the grounds that it did not sell advertising in this country. Some former Google sales executives were mystified by the claim.</p><p>Brittin subsequently clarified his remarks to say that sales were not concluded in this country, but the damage had been done.</p><p>A Reuters investigation picked apart the claim that Google sales teams were not active in this country and last weekend Jones came forward to The Sunday Times.</p><p>He wielded a dossier of 100,000 emails and documents which he claimed proved that Google advertising sales were conducted and concluded in the UK during his four years at the company. On Monday he met officials from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and handed over the dossier.</p><p>\"Sales were being made in the UK and I suspect there might be a rather large tax bill for Google at the end of this. I certainly hope the British taxpayers get some money back,\" Jones said last week.</p><p>\"It seems to me some of the largest companies have been running rings around HMRC. Someone needs to take proper charge of this issue.\"</p><p>The laceration of Apple's tax affairs by a US Senate committee helped to push the issue further on to the global agenda. The big tech firms seem to agree that tax codes are out of date and reform is needed. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, argued last week for a \"dramatic simplification\" of tax laws. Schmidt has also made clear that he supports an overhaul of the global system.</p><p>British analysts agree. Richard Brooks, a former HMRC corporate tax inspector who resigned eight years ago in disgust at what he saw as the authority's failure to tackle corporate tax avoidance, said: \"The basics of today's global tax rules were drawn up in the 1920s under the League of Nations. Since then the authorities have not kept up with with telegraph and telephone, let alone the internet.\"</p><p>Regulation is \"as bad as regulation of the banks before the economic crisis\", he added.</p><p>Even Pascal Saint-Amans, the man in charge of global tax policy at the OECD, the body that crafts international rules on taxation, says the system is rotten. \"Aggressive tax planning needs to be stopped with firmer rules,\" he said. But how? SOME hope that big companies will see the damage the tax row is doing to their brand value and volunteer to pay more. Earlier this year Starbucks agreed to add an extra \u00a310m shot of corporation tax to its 2013-14 accounts but no other firm has indicated that it will follow suit.</p><p>There is also the possibility of consumer boycotts: a recent brand preference survey showed a drop in the standing of Starbucks among coffee drinkers, which may explain a surge in sales for Costa, its British rival.</p><p>Can politicians help? Cameron has been talking tough on tax reform, but critics say he has not been acting tough. Last week he welcomed Schmidt, a member of the government's Business Advisory Group, to Downing Street, but did not tackle the Google boss directly on his company's tax avoidance.</p><p>Schmidt said yesterday he is a supporter of both Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, because he knows them personally. Although they are Conservatives they are \"socially liberal\", he said.</p><p>Brooks believes the government's own proposed reform of the controlled foreign company rules might actually make it easier for big firms to avoid tax in future.</p><p>One reason for the politicians' failure to match their words with action appears to be a belief that low taxes encourage high investment. \"I believe in low taxes for business, because we've got to encourage investment and we''ve got to encourage jobs,\" Cameron said last week.</p><p>Also, despite widespread aggressive avoidance - and the recession - the corporation tax take in the UK is holding up (see table).</p><p>If, against the odds, politicians did get their act together, could they make real changes? Prem Sikka, a UK tax expert, argues that global leaders could agree to treat multinational companies as a single global entity, instead of lots of different subsidiaries, and divide up their profits fairly country by country, according to where their real economic activity takes place. The firms would then pay whatever tax each country decided to levy.</p><p>This idea, called unitary taxation, is compellingly simple and the European Union has agreed to force big firms to reveal their corporate profits and taxes on a countryby-country basis.</p><p>However, it would require governments to agree a global formula for dividing taxable profits \"fairly\". Past experience suggests that with so much at stake this could be tricky.</p><p>Germany and France tried to pressure Ireland to give up its low 12.5% corporation tax by threatening to veto the (EURO)85bn EU bailout package for Dublin three years ago. But not even the threat of losing (EURO)85bn could persuade the Irish to budge. In the end, Paris and Berlin backed down.</p><p>Could one country act on its own? Miliband has pledged to change laws unilaterally to stop transfer pricing and clamp down on offshore tax havens. Nick Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands and a leading expert on offshore finance, said: \"Labour could quite easily close some of the tax loopholes that firms now exploit.\"</p><p>Forcing a multinational such as Google to declare all the sales it makes in Britain in Britain, rather than in Ireland, would involve renegotiating the UK's tax treaty with Dublin.</p><p>Even if that happened, Google could simply route its British profits through another tax haven such as Luxembourg.</p><p>Brooks, author of The Great Tax Robbery, admitted: \"There are things that in theory you could do to stop tax avoidance but they require global agreements which are, in practice, very difficult to get.\"</p><p>Nobody underestimates the scale of the challenge in reaching such agreements, but there is undoubtedly growing support among corporations, government - and the public - for reform.</p><p>A resolution would ensure a fairer and more transparent system. For al-Najjar at Surf 'n' Click, the demise of the Dutch sandwich and an iniquitous global tax regime cannot come soon enough.</p><p>Additional reporting: Kate Mansey A tip for the untaxables: give your cash away, Adam Boulton, page 23.</p><p>Apple's rotten core, Business, page 5</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-72866688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58H4-69T1-DY9P-N3BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>May 26, 2013 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>GROUP OF EIGHT (G8)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Tax Avoidance &amp;

When you do think  about what could be happening.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.   This is just saying that Google is impacting your searches on Hillary  Clinton.</p><p>Then you think, well, are they also impacting your searches on issues that,  you know, favor Hillary Clinton's point of view.  I mean this thing just  goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the refugee crisis.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like health care.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  It's no surprise, Maria, that there's big  mistrust of everything in big government and big institutions and big tech.   That's why were seeing this play out in this election cycle.  People have a  fundamental lack of trust in the institutions and organizations and  corporations that seem to control our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  They control your lives and  Google is in home, it's on your smart phone, it's on your tablet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the problem is you don't know it.  You don't realize  but you could be actually being taken advantage of.</p><p>We've got a can't-miss lineup this hour.  Stay with us.  We are about to  speak with former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, we will ask him  his opinion on this; former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior  adviser Mark Penn is with us; and former Yum Brands chairman and CEO David  Novak stops by as well.  </p><p>Meanwhile outrage on Capitol Hill this morning.

Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  Did you have a security clearance at that  time?  </p><p>JUSTIN COOPER, FORMER BILL CLINTON AIDE:  No I did not have a security  clearance.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  After you left the White House early in -- when did you leave  the White House?  </p><p>COOPER:  2001.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  2001.  Did you ever have a security clearance at any level after  that?  </p><p>COOPER:  No, I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Was your purpose in destroying the old Blackberry  device ever to hide Secretary Clinton's e-mails from being saved or  disclosed from federal records laws.</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman, no.  It's not in any way to destroy or hide any  information at all.  I was going out of my way to preserve all of the  information that was on those devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's why he used a hammer to destroy the device to  save it.</p><p>Joining me right now is a member of the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, Florida Congressman John Mica.  Congressman -- good to  have you on the program.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R), FLORIDA:  Good to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway from the happenings yesterday.  </p><p>MICA:  Well, I think they're trying to run the clock out.  We saw one  witness not show up, thumb his nose at Congress, two that took the Fifth  Amendment and the other we learned some information from -- this has been a  cat and mouse game from the beginning.</p><p>We started with Benghazi trying to find out what took place, who did what  and we just keep getting the stall and not the information that Congress is  entitled to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean does this just mean you are powerless in this regard?   I mean what are you going to do?  One guy, Pagliano, decides it's just not  imp.  I'm not showing up.  He blows it off.  You have the other two not  revealing anything.  And then Justin Cooper, no pushback on the fact that  he says oh no, I was trying to preserve information.  But we know he's the  guy with the hammer.  What happens now -- Congressman?  </p><p>MICA:  Again, we have to follow the law and the rules of procedure.   Pagliano did not show up.  He can be held as I questioned the chairman in  attempt of Congress.  A referral would then go to the Department of Justice  and there could be proceedings, criminal proceeding possibly against him.</p><p>Right now were looking at the options.  I don't know if the chairman will  give him another opportunity to come forward.  I don't know whether there  are other remedies from a legal standpoint we have.</p><p>But again, you see a stalling game.  This guy played the same thing with  the FBI.  We think he was granted immunity, we don't know to what extent.   But he should have at least showed up if he wanted to exercise his right  like the other two did, he could take the Fifth Amendment before us.</p><p>But again this is just a continuum of stalling; failing to give Congress  the information we are entitled to.  We are entitled to conduct a thorough  investigation.  Our committee has charge over all matters for  investigations under the House of Representatives.  And they are thwarting  that process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning -- Congressman.  Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass  by the FBI.  We know this already.  But can you tell me what is going on  with her top aides?  Are you still investigating them in Congress?  We saw  last week on the show that immunity was granted to yet another person on  the server even though we thought the investigation was closed.</p><p>What is going on with the people who are actually in control of this  information of this e-mail?  We haven't really heard and I think the  American people would like to know what is happening to those people in  power. </p><p>MICA:  Well, we heard from one witness a little bit of information.  We are  trying to gather all the facts because you can't proceed without the facts.   Some information we did learn and we seized from some of the FBI 302s.</p><p>It appears that people like Cheryl Mills, one of the aides to the secretary  possibly ordered some of the destruction of the (inaudible) that should  have been preserved.  We have a requirement to preserve records even though  she had them on a private server.  She had classified information and other  information that wasn't properly turned over and may have been destroyed.</p><p>So we're trying to find out what took place.  And every time we turn to  another witness, we find out there is more.  When they talk to the FBI they  suddenly dump new found e-mails.  It is a stall to try to run out the  clock.  And we are, I think entitled to complete the investigation in a  proper and thorough manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Here's Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- good morning.  There used to be a sense that  there were consequences for action.  And I think there is a frustration out  there in the American public that perhaps things just go to the Hill and  die nowadays whether it's the Benghazi investigation or any other  investigation regardless of where on the political spectrum it stands.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  IRS.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- IRS.  What is your timeframe for this particular situation  where Brian Pagliano ignores a subpoena, doesn't show up.  You know, I  realize you have to follow procedures but you're also Congress.  And do you  have the ability to move at your own pace here and what will your timeframe  be to deal with that?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, unlike some here, we do comply with the constitution with the  constraints imposed on us.  Even Congress has constraints.  So we can't go  and prosecute.  Now we have to see again what was done in contravention of  the law and the rules, take the steps that are allowed under the law.   Unfortunately we have a Department of Justice whether it's been Loretta  Lynch or Holder that are non-responsive and turned a blind eye.</p><p>We have a very difficult situation, a very difficult job.  But, you know,  this is kind of like that old law enforcement serial on TV.  All we want  are the facts ma'am.  And our job is to get the facts for the public and  then take action.  But we have to do that.</p><p>If they want to be lawless our side of the aisle is not going to be.  We  want to comply with the law and the proper procedures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But when you say they're trying to, you know, wipe the clock  out, you know, let the clock run out does that mean that they're going to  just let the clock run out until the end of the couple of months and let  the election happen and then they're hoping Hillary Clinton wins and then  it just dies and goes away because she's president.  Is that what you're  saying?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, again, they already have control of the Department of Justice.   It appears the FBI may have been compromised from there.  And it's much  disappointing with the Director Comey who has had a fairly good reputation  not to give us the information.  You may recall during the hearings I said  the secretary and her interview recorded.  No.  Do you have any information  from that?  Yes we have the 302s.  We still don't have the 302s from that  and some have been kept from us.</p><p>They are playing a cat and mouse game whether it's the Department of  Justice, now the FBI.  It's a very sad time for our judicial system and the  process that should move forward in an orderly manner under the  constitution laws of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What a disgrace for the American people if all of these  agencies have become compromised and politicized at this point.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for your insights.  We appreciate this.</p><p>MICA:  Good to be with you.  We will continue this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so will we.  John Mica -- joining us.</p><p>Go ahead Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I think that was very interesting what he just said.  It was  almost a throwaway comment where he said that the FBI may have been  compromised as well.  What I would say is I don't know Director Comey's  motivation for his decision that he made recently.  I will say this.  I've  had the good fortune of working with the FBI over the years including  recently and I know some of those folks.  The agents there at the FBI, they  are not compromised.  This is not an issue regarding the agents or the FBI.</p><p>This is -- and again, not knowing what Director Comey's concerns are --  DOJ, is it political?  Of course.  But the FBI -- those folks do their job  and investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know some FBI agents, too and I agree with you.  They are -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Look at all the evidence we dug out.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened to Jim Comey?</p><p>BAKER:  You know what, it's a question I don't know where we're going to  get an answer to.  And it surprised a lot of people.  You remember the talk  in Washington was all before his decision.  He's a great.  He's completely  nonpartisan.  He is the most nonpartisan person there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the interview was not recorded.  The interview wasn't  on the record.  Basically her lawyers told the FBI look, if you record this  she's not showing up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, we won't record.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And he let Loretta Lynch off the hook two days after she met on a  private plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain that to us.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's as political as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk about this tomorrow as well when we have a  special guest.  Governor Mike Pence will join us tomorrow, 8:30 a.m.  Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Don't miss our special  interview tomorrow coming up with Governor Mike Pence.</p><p>Still to come: as Hillary rests, President Obama is on the attack.  The  details as he hits the campaign trail.  We'll tell you the reception that  the President got as he stumps for Hillary.</p><p>Plus move over buffalo.  We are testing Burger King's new Cheetos chicken.   How's that for breakfast?</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 releasing more DNC documents. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.</p><p>Well, Guccifer 2.0 disclosed the documents at a cyber security conference  in London yesterday.  They include the Democratic National Committee's  finances and network infrastructure.  Among them Democratic vice  presidential candidate Tim Kaine cell phone number and the contact  information for several top White House officials.  U.S. intelligence  officials suspect Russian involvement.</p><p>Well, if you upgraded your Apple device to the latest IOS software  yesterday and you didn't have a problem.  You were one of the lucky ones.   Some people were hit by a major bug that left their devices temporarily  useless.</p><p>There are reports that some of the upgrades resulted in a so-called bricked  iPhone or iPad.  Basically when that happens your device has a black screen  and access is totally blocked.  Those unlucky people had to plug the  devices into their computers, connect to iTunes and restore their devices  completely.  This is why you should always backup your phone, folks.  Apple  acknowledging the problem; they later did say that they had resolved it.</p><p>And finally, we first told you about this new item from Burger King  yesterday, Cheetos Chicken fries.  But they're out today.  You have to eat  lunch at some point right.  So before we dive into them on set because, of  course, I brought them, we should tell you that the fries are made with all  white meat chicken.  They are covered in a flavored breading that includes  crushed up Cheetos.  Nine-piece order, $2.89 Maria and for all of you  watching your waistlines one order is 280 calories.</p><p>And I brought them to try because I think we should try things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm supposed to believe that this is 280 calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  280 calories -- would I lie to you Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If only our viewers can smell what I smell on this set right  now -- wow.  </p><p>MARTIN:  What's the calorie count?  Is the calorie count per the order?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is 280 calories.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You can taste the Cheetos.</p><p>CASONE:  You can taste the Cheetos?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm from Florida, ma'am.  We love our junk food.  The taste is  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you taste any chicken?</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the breakfast of champions, baby.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just tasty.</p><p>MARTIN:  If you have this with the Red Bull and Vodka in the morning your  day is set.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I'll tell you what, that's the breakfast of champions right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While you're enjoying your breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, let  me tell you we do have breaking news.</p><p>Bayer is acquiring Monsanto -- the deal is done, Scott Martin as we  expected.</p><p>MARTIN:  Have fun with the regulators on that one.  I mean they blocked so  many of this, this year.  It's good to see this being done.  What's funny  about this deal too, Maria, agriculture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Agriculture prices have been falling through the floor.  So it's  interesting to see these two companies get together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $128, $128 a share.</p><p>BAKER:  You know what's interesting also is what Charlie Gasparino reported  earlier which is if the EU or DOJ or both decide to nix this deal, Monsanto  walks away with a $2 billion check.  And a lifetime supply of chicken  fries.  It's a good deal for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at this, the deal is at $128.  The stock is still at $106.   So go figure.  Why is that $128?</p><p>MARTIN:  I think the market does not trust the regulators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they don't think -- somebody doesn't trust -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the biggest deal of 2016, boys and girls and so, of  course, the regulators are going to get involved in this.  They're not  going to let this just walk through.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, you've got to get through the Europeans and the Americans.   It's not just the American regulators.  It's the EU which is just so  efficient.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  Is everybody else eating these chicken fries?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Mike's almost out of chicken fries.  He knows that -- </p><p>BAKER:  I'm going to have yours and yours.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- chicken fries so fast.</p><p>CASONE:  There's honey -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  280 calories -- Scott.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I like this one.  This one is zesty and has horse radish.  So  it's good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I think the 280 does not include the sauce.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we hear new information -- Cheryl.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you-- Burger King.</p><p>BAKER:  And your fingers are not covered in Cheeto dust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  I hope you're having breakfast at home with us.</p><p>Wells Fargo's phony account scandal putting fraud in the spotlight -- what  you need to protect your money.  </p><p>Plus making a smart home a reality -- the big name Amazon is teaming up  with to bring the future to life.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo plummeting over the outrage surrounding the phony  bank accounts costing the company its standing as the largest U.S. bank by  market capitalization.  JP Morgan back up to number one. </p><p>Many hold the bank's sales targets responsible for employee creating  unauthorized accounts.  But Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is shifting the  blame to employees.  He said quote, \"There was no incentive to do bad  things.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former FBI white collar crime expert Ken Springer  and IDT 911 founder Adam Levin.  Good to see you gentlemen.  Thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you.  What do you think was behind this  because now people are saying if this was so prevalent as Wells Fargo --  5,300 employees creating this phony accounts, are we going to see this at  other banks?</p><p>KEN SPRINGER, FORMER FBI WHITE COLLAR CRIME EXPERT:  Well, I don't know if  it's a fraud or a conspiracy because you can't have 5,300 people involved  in that.  I think more than anything it's probably aggressive sales  practices.</p><p>And I think if the FBI gets involved they can probably talk to some of  these people and they're going to find out what really happened.  Was it  limited to one region?  How far up the ladder does it go? </p><p>And I think the bigger issue is going to be if they did this would they  have opened other accounts for bad actors -- whether it's drug dealers,  money launderers and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we don't know that.  I mean we don't know who the accounts  were for -- right.</p><p>SPRINGER:  That hasn't come out.</p><p>BART:  Ok.  So the sales targets, Ken, were set by higher level executives.   One executive actually is leaving the bank with $126 million payday.  Since  then Wells Fargo has to pay hundred $185 million in fines for defrauding  customers.  This reported payday that Carrie Tolstedt is walking out with,  does this add to the wrongdoing in your view?  How does that play into  this?  This doesn't look good.</p><p>SPRINGER:  We don't know.  It doesn't look good.  And it goes back to I  think when Mary Jo White took over the SEC.  She talked about not letting  financial institutions say without admitting or denying guilt, paying the  fine and moving on.  I think they're going to see if there's someone who  should be held accountable for this violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Adam, you've got a book \"Swiped: How to protect  yourself in a world full of scammer, phishers and identity thieves\".  Will  you explain to us how we can protect our money at banks with what we see  happening.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, IDT 911 FOUNDER:  Well, you know, again, here is a situation  where the bank ran off with the stork, consumers ended up holding the bag  that this system encouraged this kind of action.  And the things I talk  about in the book is you have to realize this is a classic definition of  identity theft that occurred.  People were using the personally  identifiable, sensitive information of other people for their gain.</p><p>So what consumers need to do is they need to do a number of things.  First,  you need to monitor.  You should be checking your accounts on a daily  basis.  You should be signing up for what is called transactional  monitoring alerts which means that any time there's any activity in your  accounts, you're notified of it and you should be specifically looking for  small charges or what they like to call ghost charges because usually they  are designed in order to evade bank systems and to evade consumer scrutiny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVIN:  You should also consider freezing your credit so that nobody  including you can get access to your credit for the purpose of opening up a  credit card account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's death by a thousand cuts -- Mike.</p><p>BAKER:  What you think is the proper response at this stage?  What should  they do -- senior management within Well Fargo?  </p><p>LEVIN:  I think that people have to walk the plank.  And I'm not just  talking about lower level people.  I think higher-level people -- the  confidence of consumers has been shaken in this financial institution.  And  as a result it will be shaken in other financial institutions and don't  forget, the scandal that happened a few years ago where a number of  financial institutions were reordering the chronology of debit accounts --  debit charges in order to put the consumer over on the first charge to  charge multiple over limit fees which is one of the things that led to the  Credit Card Reform Act.</p><p>MARTIN:  And that's the scary thing.  I mean this was going on for years  and years and years under Ms. Tolstedt's watch or on her watch and she was  able to stay in the position.  People were getting fired in her department  yet the banking executive did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't look good.</p><p>MARTIN:  If your consumer and you're banking at Wells Fargo, wow do you  feel good about having an account there.  The CEO has said he is not  resigning.  He's not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>LEVIN:  But should there be the question, should there be a call back of  the $125 million that she's getting as she walks out the door.  I don't  think you reward people for being oblivious to things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially since she's walking out with all that money.</p><p>Ken -- real quick.  Final word from you in terms of what we should be  looking at for potential bank fraud.  You are former white-collar criminal  FBI so tell us what we should be looking at.</p><p>SPRINGER:  Well, there is a lot that needs to come out yet and probably in  the next 24, we'll learn a lot more.  But did they really -- we go in and  open an account at our bank.  Do you go in -- do you sign a signature card?   Do you show forms of ID?  I don't think that happened.  I think they  manipulated the system.  But there is still the potential for fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of this culture that you had to meet the sales targets.</p><p>SPRINGER:  I think that's what's going to happen.  I think the bigger fall  fallout is going to be 5,300 people are without a job now.  And they're  going to be kind of potentially toxic trying to get jobs now as part of  this.  And what can they do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  You're going to have that on your  resume.  Yes, I just came from Wells Fargo and this is why I left.</p><p>SPRINGER:  But in my experience -- I'm sorry, Maria -- is disclose it.   Tell it upfront because you know, it's like Drexel back years, MF Global,  people will get over it.  Tell them you were part of it and move on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think the key takeaway here is pay attention.  You've got a  personal responsibility.  You open an account.  You're dealing a financial  institution.  You've got a credit card or whatever it is, your statements  arrive, you've got to pay attention.  Otherwise things happen.  And as you  pointed out this is not the first time.</p><p>LEVIN:  No one has a greater interest in your financial security than you  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bottom line.</p><p>MARTIN:  These other people apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Springer, Adam Levin -- the book is \"Swiped\" -- thank you  so much, sir, for joining us.  Thank you very much Mr. Springer.</p><p>Coming up, another secretary of state and another scandal -- the shocking  claims surrounding John Kerry's tenure.</p><p>Plus making the Second Amendment fashionable?  The company giving new  meeting to conceal and carry.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody; welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday September 14.  Here are your top stories, 7:30  a.m. on the East Coast:  Breaking news moments ago, Bayer acquires  Monsanto, deal is done; valued at $66 billion, that is $128 per share.   This was first reported by our own Charlie Gasparino. (HEADLINES) (MARKET  HEADLINES)</p><p>President Obama on the campaign trail now for the ailing Hillary Clinton.   He used his time in Philadelphia yesterday to slam Donald Trump and his  comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  Think about what's happened to the Republican  Party.  They used to be opposed to Russian and authoritarianism.  Their  nominee is out their praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he  invades smaller countries, jails his opponents and when they interview him,  ask him, well, why do you support this guy?  Well, he's a strong guy.   Look, he's got an 82-percent poll rating.  Well, yes.  So did - Saddam  Hussein had a 90-percent poll rating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Donald Trump responded to President Obama's attack  on Twitter.  He said, \"Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years.   Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez.  He  is the author of the new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance.\"  Good morning,  Judge.  Good morning good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>ALBERTO GONZALEZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Good morning; it's good to  be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I've got to get your reaction to all of this talk about  Russia.  I mean, I seem to remember, quite clearly, it was President Obama  who whispered in the ear of then Prime Minister Medvedev to say, or he was  president at the time, I will have more flexibility, -- tell Vladimir Putin  I will have more flexibility after the election.  It seems there is a lot  more ties between Clinton and Obama and Secretary Clinton than Donald  Trump; correct me if I'm wrong.  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  I think you're right.  We have to remember that we're in this  sort of silly season right now.  We're in a political campaign and there  are going to be outrageous claims, honestly, made by both sides in order to  win political points.  But, obviously, we watch Russia very carefully.   Obviously what they do around the world is something of great interest to  us.  Because they are a powerful nation, they can be helpful in dealing  with certain problems that we need help with, for example in Syria.  So the  notion of having some kind of relationship with them is not a totally bad  thing.  </p><p>But, again, some of the comments yesterday from President Obama, I just  chalk up we're in the political season.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see; so have U.S.-Russian relations changed in the post-9/11  world, where the war on terror has been the top priority?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know, I think (inaudible) depending on circumstances.  I  don't know that I would trust Russia implicitly.  I think we need to --  they could be helpful, but obviously they will be doing some things that  are in their best interest and not necessarily consistent with our best  interest.  So we just simply have to deal with them, I think, with that  kind of mind set.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are obviously were in a very important place during the  beginning of the war on terror.  You are defending that in your new book,  \"True Faith and Allegiance,\" in your new memoir.  What are you trying to  communicate, Judge?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, one thing I try to communicate is all the difficult  decisions that President Bush had to make, and those of us who advised him;  some of them are controversial, but one of the things I hope that readers  come away with is how hard we worked to try to get it right, particularly  in terms of the legal issues that arose.  Many of these legal issues we had  not seen since World War II.  Some of the legal issues we had never seen  before, such as how do you deal effectively and legally with a non-state  actor.  </p><p>So hopefully - you know, I don't shy away from any of the controversial  issues.  They are all in the book, beginning with Guantanamo, military  commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, electronic surveillance,  it's all in there and hopefully the readers will have a better  understanding of the reasons why these decisions were made and the  rationale behind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So once we understand what took place and where we are right  now, the next question is where are we going.  We know that Donald Trump  has talked about expanding the military, investing in the military and  getting tougher.  Hillary Clinton has said she wants to continue many of  the policies of President Obama and that we need Middle Eastern friends  help to actually take down ISIS.  What is the right path going forward?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, I do believe we need Middle Eastern friends.  This is not  something that we can be successful alone.  However, I do worry about the  changing viewpoint about America around the world.  I think we are America.    We are the beacon of hope and democracy and we are expected to lead. I  worry that we sort of stepped back from that.  I think the common phrase is  we are leading from behind.  I just think that puts the United States in a  very dangerous and precarious position. </p><p>I worry that we are less today than we were, say, on 9/11, 15 years ago.   The threats have evolved and I think the United States needs to be very  forceful, in terms of trying to influence outcomes overseas.  I'm not  suggesting we put troops on the ground, but I think we need to influence  outcomes so we don't have outcomes that are contrary to our interests.  So,  I do worry about where we are today in foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you made a decision to support a Donald Trump for  president?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know I'm a lifelong Republican.  I hope to vote republican,  but I'm an American first.  I'm going to vote in terms of who I believe is  best for America, best for me and for my family.  Listen, we still have two  months before the election.  We have three presidential debates coming up.   We've got time to make this decision, which is a very important one because  it is a very dangerous time around the world for us.  Also we have some  serious domestic policy issues that we need to confront, like the deficit.   So, I'm going to make a very informed decision.  I encourage all of your  viewers to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right; so you want to watch these debates and you want to  make sure you're solid before coming out publicly and endorsing the  Republican candidate. </p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on on the Democratic side, Judge, because  two witnesses, yesterday, at a House hearing on Hillary Clinton's email  server pled The Fifth, yesterday, while a third failed to show.  As a  former attorney general, should a special prosecutor have been important to  investigate Hillary's email server?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  That's a difficult one for me to answer.  I do know that the  unfortunate conversation that occurred between Loretta Lynch and former  President Bill Clinton at the airport.  I think that was very unfortunate  for the investigation, and, you know, some AG's may have taken that alone  as a basis to appoint a special prosecutor because, in the end, it's not  about the attorney general's involvement in the case that's important.   What is important is that we have total confidence in the justice system,  that it's going to be impartial in the way it conducts its investigation  and in the decision it makes to move forward with the prosecution.  </p><p>What I worry about what happened here is it appears as a result of that  conversation Attorney General Lynch sort of stepped away entirely from this  case and as a result it fell entirely to Jim Comey.  Most of your viewers  probably do not understand, the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The  FBI Director reports to the Attorney General, and at the end of the day the  FBI is response for investigations.  They present whatever they find to the  prosecutors and the prosecutors decide whether or not the case should move  forward or not.  It seems to me in this case it was sort of turned on its  head and the investigator, Jim Comey, made the decision not to move forward  with the prosecution; and that troubles me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, this is your, obviously, successor, Loretta Lynch.   If you were sitting on your plane, as attorney general, and you got the  message from your aide saying Bill Clinton wants to come up to the plane  and talk to you, and you know that Hillary Clinton is going to be  testifying or - not testifying but doing the interview with the FBI two  days later, what would you have said to your aide?  What should she have  done?  Should she have said, listen, I can't take the meeting?  What would  you have done?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Yes; I think that would've - look, at most you would go and say  hello to the president as a matter of courtesy and say, you know, hello.   Obviously because of the circumstances involving your wife we can't have a  conversation; or it would have been totally appropriate to simply say -  send back a message saying because of the circumstances involving your wife  it wouldn't look good for either the wife or the attorney general to have  any kind of conversation or meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; or how about having an aide on the plane?  Have you ever  seen a situation where such an important position doesn't have someone  taking notes?  There was no one else on the plane.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yes, that would not be unusual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Typically - a private meeting like that would likely occur,  where you would not have anybody on the plane. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I'm getting at, Judge, real quick, actually, have  we become incredibly politicized?  I mean, you see what happened with  Loretta Lynch on the plane with Bill Clinton.  Then you look at Jim Comey  testifying with the FBI investigation.  You look at the IRS targeting  conservatives.  What is going on?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, certainly there's the appearance of politicalization at  the Department of Justice, and that is troubling to me and that's something  that we should worry about and something the attorney general has an  obligation to address because the Department should be viewed as a  Department that operates without any kind of bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; Mr. Gonzalez, good to have you on the program.  Judge,  thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Congratulations on the book.  Be  sure to turn in tomorrow, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, and Indiana  Governor, Mike Pence my special guest.  Back in a moment; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Victims of the 2012 shooting at a Colorado movie  theatre will not be on the hook for the major legal fee.  Cheryl Casone  with that story and other headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl; thank you so much.  Coming up next, conceal  and carry getting more stylish.  How one company is helping women carry  their firearm fashionably; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Firearms and fashion, a combination that  gunmakers have ignored this for decades as they focus their marketing on  male customers.  Background checks for gun purchases hit a record high in  July and growing demand from women have created a new fashion industry.   This is amazing.  These products are designed for women, by women and they  offer a stylish look and practical way for women to carry their guns.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the owner of Nickel and Lace, Marilyn Smolenski.   Marilyn, good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARILYN SMOLENSKI, OWNER, NICKEL AND LACE:  Thank you for having me.  It's  a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you come up with this idea?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well, I was taking some classes with my husband back in 2011  and I just wasn't satisfied with any of the holsters that were on the  market.  They were all really geared towards men and men's bodies, not  women's figures, so I made my own.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We actually have one of my colleagues wearing it this morning,  I'm going to show it in a minute; but how did you get into the firearms  accessory business to begin with?  Did you see this demand out there that  you felt women needed fashion and an opportunity to conceal and carry?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes, ma'am; absolutely.  At the time most of the manufactures  were just making products smaller and turning them pink and that's how they  were marketed to women.  So there wasn't really anything for a woman's body  and for our curves and I definitely saw something, a need there on the  market for new items from women.  So I spoke to some girlfriends that were  in the fashion industry and also police officers and they were really  excited and really encouraged me to go forward with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of reception are you seeing right now at Nickel and  Lace?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Oh, just an outpouring of support.  You know, when I first  started it was kind of a taboo issue here in Chicago, as you can imagine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  -- this is where I'm based.  But, you know, as time goes on or  more people are being supportive of it, especially as the crime goes up in  the city.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us what we need to know to actually wear one of these  things.  What are the particulars and how does it work?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  So the particulars are that this is a shapewear based  foundation, so it goes underneath your clothing, and it has special use  pockets on either side, so it's ambidextrous.  It's meant for a cross body  draw for a subcompact firearm.  So, for a smaller firearm, which does hide  better on a woman's body.  If you're not going to use of firearm, in places  like Chicago you can't carry everywhere, you can also carry your cellphone,  your keys, your id. It's also what I did when I was in Europe.  I was  carrying different items so I wouldn't get, let's say, pickpocketed on the  subway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a different -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  There is a lot of different functionalities to it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has different uses.  Morgan Ortagus, who is with us this  morning, has it on.  Let's take a look.  Morgan, how does it feel?  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  I love the fact that it's  shapewear.  We were just saying backstage you could wear this underneath a  blazer and then you could see the sides, right there, where the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gun would go.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- gun, your cellphone, whatever, right here.  So, yes, it feels  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it feels like it's a shaper.  You like it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It does feel like shapewear.  I might keep it on for the rest of  the show.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well you can keep it.  You can have it if you love it.  It's  yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the next for Nickel and Lace?  Are you planning to  expand this brand -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- or are you going to stay with firearms?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  You know what, we are going to expand to a lot of things but  most things are going to incorporate firearms.  We're working on outerwear  vest at the moment, and it will have conceal carry pockets on the inside of  a fashion vest, either faux fur or suede.  We're also working on a running  belly band for runners, as well as another shape wear but with some lace  and added features to it.  So we are just plowing away with research and  development and making our products better and more useful for women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, no doubt, being based in Chicago you've seen what has  gone on there, in terms of the murders in the violence.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it must be resonating in Chicago?  People want to protect  themselves.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  It really is.  Correct.  Correct.  You know, my sales were more  out of state before, but now, with the rise in crime, I am seeing an  increase in sales, as well, here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn, we'll be watching the developments.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn Smolenski there joining us; Nickel and Lace.  And,  Morgan, you may wear this for the rest of the show?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Listen, you know, shape wear and pistols?  God Bless America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go; coming up, the fast food wars are heating up.  We  tried the Burger King Cheetos Chicken fries but that's not all the  industries doing to being in customers.  We'll talk to the former Young  Brown's founder, David Novak in the next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; good Wednesday morning, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, September 14.

Welcome  back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, September 14.  Here are your  top stories, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hillary Clinton off the campaign trail for a third straight day but the  questions over her private e-mail server are looming large during a  congressional hearing.  And Donald Trump is on the attack on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  This attitude of arrogance that  explains why Hillary Clinton made 13 phones disappear including with a  hammer, so the FBI couldn't see them.  And why she bleached her e-mails  after a congressional subpoena -- that's after the subpoena came.</p><p>Now the people who destroyed the e-mails are all pleading the Fifth  Amendment in front of Congress.  Anyone watching today's hearing in  Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The latest on the race to the White House coming up.</p><p>Plus protecting your finances.  The Wells Fargo scandal raising questions  for bank customers across the country.  What you need to know to keep your  money safe -- coming up.</p><p>A rough start for Apple's latest software upgrade -- the update causing  major problems for users sparking social media outrage.  We'll bring it to  you.</p><p>And taking the smart home to a new level.  Amazon teams up with General  Electric so you can remotely preheat your oven and start your laundry.</p><p>Concealed carry hits the runway.  We have a look at one company that's  making it easier for women to carry their weapons.  Yes.</p><p>In markets, futures edging higher this morning -- another big move  yesterday and we are extending that move.  Take a look.  The markets are  expected to open fractionally better on the session today.  </p><p>In Europe the tone was set higher, led by a rebound in the price of oil.   FT 100 up two-thirds of a percent now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  And the Kospi in Korea  closed for a holiday.  </p><p>We've got all of those stories coming up this hour.</p><p>And joining me to talk about it Maverick PAC national co-chair Morgan  Ortagus; Kingsview Asset Management Scott Martin; and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.</p><p>Wow, what a story on Google just there.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  It's incredible.  When you do think  about what could be happening.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.   This is just saying that Google is impacting your searches on Hillary  Clinton.</p><p>Then you think, well, are they also impacting your searches on issues that,  you know, favor Hillary Clinton's point of view.  I mean this thing just  goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the refugee crisis.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like health care.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  It's no surprise, Maria, that there's big  mistrust of everything in big government and big institutions and big tech.   That's why were seeing this play out in this election cycle.  People have a  fundamental lack of trust in the institutions and organizations and  corporations that seem to control our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  They control your lives and  Google is in home, it's on your smart phone, it's on your tablet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the problem is you don't know it.  You don't realize  but you could be actually being taken advantage of.</p><p>We've got a can't-miss lineup this hour.  Stay with us.  We are about to  speak with former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, we will ask him  his opinion on this; former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior  adviser Mark Penn is with us; and former Yum Brands chairman and CEO David  Novak stops by as well.  </p><p>Meanwhile outrage on Capitol Hill this morning.  Three former Clinton  workers refusing to testify before a congressional oversight committee  yesterday regarding the Democratic nominee's use of a private server.   Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to  answer and observe my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I respectfully decline to answer and observe my Fifth  Amendment constitutional privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no opening statement.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper also took the stand but  he actually answered questions.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  Did you have a security clearance at that  time?  </p><p>JUSTIN COOPER, FORMER BILL CLINTON AIDE:  No I did not have a security  clearance.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  After you left the White House early in -- when did you leave  the White House?  </p><p>COOPER:  2001.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  2001.  Did you ever have a security clearance at any level after  that?  </p><p>COOPER:  No, I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Was your purpose in destroying the old Blackberry  device ever to hide Secretary Clinton's e-mails from being saved or  disclosed from federal records laws.</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman, no.  It's not in any way to destroy or hide any  information at all.  I was going out of my way to preserve all of the  information that was on those devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's why he used a hammer to destroy the device to  save it.</p><p>Joining me right now is a member of the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, Florida Congressman John Mica.  Congressman -- good to  have you on the program.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R), FLORIDA:  Good to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway from the happenings yesterday.  </p><p>MICA:  Well, I think they're trying to run the clock out.  We saw one  witness not show up, thumb his nose at Congress, two that took the Fifth  Amendment and the other we learned some information from -- this has been a  cat and mouse game from the beginning.</p><p>We started with Benghazi trying to find out what took place, who did what  and we just keep getting the stall and not the information that Congress is  entitled to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean does this just mean you are powerless in this regard?   I mean what are you going to do?  One guy, Pagliano, decides it's just not  imp.  I'm not showing up.  He blows it off.  You have the other two not  revealing anything.  And then Justin Cooper, no pushback on the fact that  he says oh no, I was trying to preserve information.  But we know he's the  guy with the hammer.  What happens now -- Congressman?  </p><p>MICA:  Again, we have to follow the law and the rules of procedure.   Pagliano did not show up.  He can be held as I questioned the chairman in  attempt of Congress.  A referral would then go to the Department of Justice  and there could be proceedings, criminal proceeding possibly against him.</p><p>Right now were looking at the options.  I don't know if the chairman will  give him another opportunity to come forward.  I don't know whether there  are other remedies from a legal standpoint we have.</p><p>But again, you see a stalling game.  This guy played the same thing with  the FBI.  We think he was granted immunity, we don't know to what extent.   But he should have at least showed up if he wanted to exercise his right  like the other two did, he could take the Fifth Amendment before us.</p><p>But again this is just a continuum of stalling; failing to give Congress  the information we are entitled to.  We are entitled to conduct a thorough  investigation.  Our committee has charge over all matters for  investigations under the House of Representatives.  And they are thwarting  that process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning -- Congressman.  Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass  by the FBI.  We know this already.  But can you tell me what is going on  with her top aides?  Are you still investigating them in Congress?  We saw  last week on the show that immunity was granted to yet another person on  the server even though we thought the investigation was closed.</p><p>What is going on with the people who are actually in control of this  information of this e-mail?  We haven't really heard and I think the  American people would like to know what is happening to those people in  power. </p><p>MICA:  Well, we heard from one witness a little bit of information.  We are  trying to gather all the facts because you can't proceed without the facts.   Some information we did learn and we seized from some of the FBI 302s.</p><p>It appears that people like Cheryl Mills, one of the aides to the secretary  possibly ordered some of the destruction of the (inaudible) that should  have been preserved.  We have a requirement to preserve records even though  she had them on a private server.  She had classified information and other  information that wasn't properly turned over and may have been destroyed.</p><p>So we're trying to find out what took place.  And every time we turn to  another witness, we find out there is more.  When they talk to the FBI they  suddenly dump new found e-mails.  It is a stall to try to run out the  clock.  And we are, I think entitled to complete the investigation in a  proper and thorough manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Here's Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- good morning.  There used to be a sense that  there were consequences for action.  And I think there is a frustration out  there in the American public that perhaps things just go to the Hill and  die nowadays whether it's the Benghazi investigation or any other  investigation regardless of where on the political spectrum it stands.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  IRS.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- IRS.  What is your timeframe for this particular situation  where Brian Pagliano ignores a subpoena, doesn't show up.  You know, I  realize you have to follow procedures but you're also Congress.  And do you  have the ability to move at your own pace here and what will your timeframe  be to deal with that?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, unlike some here, we do comply with the constitution with the  constraints imposed on us.  Even Congress has constraints.  So we can't go  and prosecute.  Now we have to see again what was done in contravention of  the law and the rules, take the steps that are allowed under the law.   Unfortunately we have a Department of Justice whether it's been Loretta  Lynch or Holder that are non-responsive and turned a blind eye.</p><p>We have a very difficult situation, a very difficult job.  But, you know,  this is kind of like that old law enforcement serial on TV.  All we want  are the facts ma'am.  And our job is to get the facts for the public and  then take action.  But we have to do that.</p><p>If they want to be lawless our side of the aisle is not going to be.  We  want to comply with the law and the proper procedures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But when you say they're trying to, you know, wipe the clock  out, you know, let the clock run out does that mean that they're going to  just let the clock run out until the end of the couple of months and let  the election happen and then they're hoping Hillary Clinton wins and then  it just dies and goes away because she's president.  Is that what you're  saying?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, again, they already have control of the Department of Justice.   It appears the FBI may have been compromised from there.  And it's much  disappointing with the Director Comey who has had a fairly good reputation  not to give us the information.  You may recall during the hearings I said  the secretary and her interview recorded.  No.  Do you have any information  from that?  Yes we have the 302s.  We still don't have the 302s from that  and some have been kept from us.</p><p>They are playing a cat and mouse game whether it's the Department of  Justice, now the FBI.  It's a very sad time for our judicial system and the  process that should move forward in an orderly manner under the  constitution laws of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What a disgrace for the American people if all of these  agencies have become compromised and politicized at this point.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for your insights.  We appreciate this.</p><p>MICA:  Good to be with you.  We will continue this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so will we.  John Mica -- joining us.</p><p>Go ahead Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I think that was very interesting what he just said.  It was  almost a throwaway comment where he said that the FBI may have been  compromised as well.  What I would say is I don't know Director Comey's  motivation for his decision that he made recently.  I will say this.  I've  had the good fortune of working with the FBI over the years including  recently and I know some of those folks.  The agents there at the FBI, they  are not compromised.  This is not an issue regarding the agents or the FBI.</p><p>This is -- and again, not knowing what Director Comey's concerns are --  DOJ, is it political?  Of course.  But the FBI -- those folks do their job  and investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know some FBI agents, too and I agree with you.  They are -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Look at all the evidence we dug out.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened to Jim Comey?</p><p>BAKER:  You know what, it's a question I don't know where we're going to  get an answer to.  And it surprised a lot of people.  You remember the talk  in Washington was all before his decision.  He's a great.  He's completely  nonpartisan.  He is the most nonpartisan person there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the interview was not recorded.  The interview wasn't  on the record.  Basically her lawyers told the FBI look, if you record this  she's not showing up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, we won't record.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And he let Loretta Lynch off the hook two days after she met on a  private plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain that to us.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's as political as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk about this tomorrow as well when we have a  special guest.  Governor Mike Pence will join us tomorrow, 8:30 a.m.  Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Don't miss our special  interview tomorrow coming up with Governor Mike Pence.</p><p>Still to come: as Hillary rests, President Obama is on the attack.  The  details as he hits the campaign trail.  We'll tell you the reception that  the President got as he stumps for Hillary.</p><p>Plus move over buffalo.  We are testing Burger King's new Cheetos chicken.   How's that for breakfast?</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 releasing more DNC documents. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.</p><p>Well, Guccifer 2.0 disclosed the documents at a cyber security conference  in London yesterday.  They include the Democratic National Committee's  finances and network infrastructure.  Among them Democratic vice  presidential candidate Tim Kaine cell phone number and the contact  information for several top White House officials.  U.S. intelligence  officials suspect Russian involvement.</p><p>Well, if you upgraded your Apple device to the latest IOS software  yesterday and you didn't have a problem.  You were one of the lucky ones.   Some people were hit by a major bug that left their devices temporarily  useless.</p><p>There are reports that some of the upgrades resulted in a so-called bricked  iPhone or iPad.  Basically when that happens your device has a black screen  and access is totally blocked.  Those unlucky people had to plug the  devices into their computers, connect to iTunes and restore their devices  completely.  This is why you should always backup your phone, folks.  Apple  acknowledging the problem; they later did say that they had resolved it.</p><p>And finally, we first told you about this new item from Burger King  yesterday, Cheetos Chicken fries.  But they're out today.  You have to eat  lunch at some point right.  So before we dive into them on set because, of  course, I brought them, we should tell you that the fries are made with all  white meat chicken.  They are covered in a flavored breading that includes  crushed up Cheetos.  Nine-piece order, $2.89 Maria and for all of you  watching your waistlines one order is 280 calories.</p><p>And I brought them to try because I think we should try things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm supposed to believe that this is 280 calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  280 calories -- would I lie to you Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If only our viewers can smell what I smell on this set right  now -- wow.  </p><p>MARTIN:  What's the calorie count?  Is the calorie count per the order?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is 280 calories.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You can taste the Cheetos.</p><p>CASONE:  You can taste the Cheetos?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm from Florida, ma'am.  We love our junk food.  The taste is  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you taste any chicken?</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the breakfast of champions, baby.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just tasty.</p><p>MARTIN:  If you have this with the Red Bull and Vodka in the morning your  day is set.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I'll tell you what, that's the breakfast of champions right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While you're enjoying your breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, let  me tell you we do have breaking news.</p><p>Bayer is acquiring Monsanto -- the deal is done, Scott Martin as we  expected.</p><p>MARTIN:  Have fun with the regulators on that one.  I mean they blocked so  many of this, this year.  It's good to see this being done.  What's funny  about this deal too, Maria, agriculture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Agriculture prices have been falling through the floor.  So it's  interesting to see these two companies get together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $128, $128 a share.</p><p>BAKER:  You know what's interesting also is what Charlie Gasparino reported  earlier which is if the EU or DOJ or both decide to nix this deal, Monsanto  walks away with a $2 billion check.  And a lifetime supply of chicken  fries.  It's a good deal for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at this, the deal is at $128.  The stock is still at $106.   So go figure.  Why is that $128?</p><p>MARTIN:  I think the market does not trust the regulators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they don't think -- somebody doesn't trust -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the biggest deal of 2016, boys and girls and so, of  course, the regulators are going to get involved in this.  They're not  going to let this just walk through.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, you've got to get through the Europeans and the Americans.   It's not just the American regulators.  It's the EU which is just so  efficient.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  Is everybody else eating these chicken fries?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Mike's almost out of chicken fries.  He knows that -- </p><p>BAKER:  I'm going to have yours and yours.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- chicken fries so fast.</p><p>CASONE:  There's honey -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  280 calories -- Scott.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I like this one.  This one is zesty and has horse radish.  So  it's good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I think the 280 does not include the sauce.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we hear new information -- Cheryl.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you-- Burger King.</p><p>BAKER:  And your fingers are not covered in Cheeto dust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  I hope you're having breakfast at home with us.</p><p>Wells Fargo's phony account scandal putting fraud in the spotlight -- what  you need to protect your money.  </p><p>Plus making a smart home a reality -- the big name Amazon is teaming up  with to bring the future to life.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo plummeting over the outrage surrounding the phony  bank accounts costing the company its standing as the largest U.S. bank by  market capitalization.  JP Morgan back up to number one. </p><p>Many hold the bank's sales targets responsible for employee creating  unauthorized accounts.  But Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is shifting the  blame to employees.  He said quote, \"There was no incentive to do bad  things.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former FBI white collar crime expert Ken Springer  and IDT 911 founder Adam Levin.  Good to see you gentlemen.  Thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you.  What do you think was behind this  because now people are saying if this was so prevalent as Wells Fargo --  5,300 employees creating this phony accounts, are we going to see this at  other banks?</p><p>KEN SPRINGER, FORMER FBI WHITE COLLAR CRIME EXPERT:  Well, I don't know if  it's a fraud or a conspiracy because you can't have 5,300 people involved  in that.  I think more than anything it's probably aggressive sales  practices.</p><p>And I think if the FBI gets involved they can probably talk to some of  these people and they're going to find out what really happened.  Was it  limited to one region?  How far up the ladder does it go? </p><p>And I think the bigger issue is going to be if they did this would they  have opened other accounts for bad actors -- whether it's drug dealers,  money launderers and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we don't know that.  I mean we don't know who the accounts  were for -- right.</p><p>SPRINGER:  That hasn't come out.</p><p>BART:  Ok.  So the sales targets, Ken, were set by higher level executives.   One executive actually is leaving the bank with $126 million payday.  Since  then Wells Fargo has to pay hundred $185 million in fines for defrauding  customers.  This reported payday that Carrie Tolstedt is walking out with,  does this add to the wrongdoing in your view?  How does that play into  this?  This doesn't look good.</p><p>SPRINGER:  We don't know.  It doesn't look good.  And it goes back to I  think when Mary Jo White took over the SEC.  She talked about not letting  financial institutions say without admitting or denying guilt, paying the  fine and moving on.  I think they're going to see if there's someone who  should be held accountable for this violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Adam, you've got a book \"Swiped: How to protect  yourself in a world full of scammer, phishers and identity thieves\".  Will  you explain to us how we can protect our money at banks with what we see  happening.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, IDT 911 FOUNDER:  Well, you know, again, here is a situation  where the bank ran off with the stork, consumers ended up holding the bag  that this system encouraged this kind of action.  And the things I talk  about in the book is you have to realize this is a classic definition of  identity theft that occurred.  People were using the personally  identifiable, sensitive information of other people for their gain.</p><p>So what consumers need to do is they need to do a number of things.  First,  you need to monitor.  You should be checking your accounts on a daily  basis.  You should be signing up for what is called transactional  monitoring alerts which means that any time there's any activity in your  accounts, you're notified of it and you should be specifically looking for  small charges or what they like to call ghost charges because usually they  are designed in order to evade bank systems and to evade consumer scrutiny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVIN:  You should also consider freezing your credit so that nobody  including you can get access to your credit for the purpose of opening up a  credit card account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's death by a thousand cuts -- Mike.</p><p>BAKER:  What you think is the proper response at this stage?  What should  they do -- senior management within Well Fargo?  </p><p>LEVIN:  I think that people have to walk the plank.  And I'm not just  talking about lower level people.  I think higher-level people -- the  confidence of consumers has been shaken in this financial institution.  And  as a result it will be shaken in other financial institutions and don't  forget, the scandal that happened a few years ago where a number of  financial institutions were reordering the chronology of debit accounts --  debit charges in order to put the consumer over on the first charge to  charge multiple over limit fees which is one of the things that led to the  Credit Card Reform Act.</p><p>MARTIN:  And that's the scary thing.  I mean this was going on for years  and years and years under Ms. Tolstedt's watch or on her watch and she was  able to stay in the position.  People were getting fired in her department  yet the banking executive did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't look good.</p><p>MARTIN:  If your consumer and you're banking at Wells Fargo, wow do you  feel good about having an account there.  The CEO has said he is not  resigning.  He's not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>LEVIN:  But should there be the question, should there be a call back of  the $125 million that she's getting as she walks out the door.  I don't  think you reward people for being oblivious to things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially since she's walking out with all that money.</p><p>Ken -- real quick.  Final word from you in terms of what we should be  looking at for potential bank fraud.  You are former white-collar criminal  FBI so tell us what we should be looking at.</p><p>SPRINGER:  Well, there is a lot that needs to come out yet and probably in  the next 24, we'll learn a lot more.  But did they really -- we go in and  open an account at our bank.  Do you go in -- do you sign a signature card?   Do you show forms of ID?  I don't think that happened.  I think they  manipulated the system.  But there is still the potential for fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of this culture that you had to meet the sales targets.</p><p>SPRINGER:  I think that's what's going to happen.  I think the bigger fall  fallout is going to be 5,300 people are without a job now.  And they're  going to be kind of potentially toxic trying to get jobs now as part of  this.  And what can they do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  You're going to have that on your  resume.  Yes, I just came from Wells Fargo and this is why I left.</p><p>SPRINGER:  But in my experience -- I'm sorry, Maria -- is disclose it.   Tell it upfront because you know, it's like Drexel back years, MF Global,  people will get over it.  Tell them you were part of it and move on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think the key takeaway here is pay attention.  You've got a  personal responsibility.  You open an account.  You're dealing a financial  institution.  You've got a credit card or whatever it is, your statements  arrive, you've got to pay attention.  Otherwise things happen.  And as you  pointed out this is not the first time.</p><p>LEVIN:  No one has a greater interest in your financial security than you  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bottom line.</p><p>MARTIN:  These other people apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Springer, Adam Levin -- the book is \"Swiped\" -- thank you  so much, sir, for joining us.  Thank you very much Mr. Springer.</p><p>Coming up, another secretary of state and another scandal -- the shocking  claims surrounding John Kerry's tenure.</p><p>Plus making the Second Amendment fashionable?  The company giving new  meeting to conceal and carry.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody; welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday September 14.  Here are your top stories, 7:30  a.m. on the East Coast:  Breaking news moments ago, Bayer acquires  Monsanto, deal is done; valued at $66 billion, that is $128 per share.   This was first reported by our own Charlie Gasparino. (HEADLINES) (MARKET  HEADLINES)</p><p>President Obama on the campaign trail now for the ailing Hillary Clinton.   He used his time in Philadelphia yesterday to slam Donald Trump and his  comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  Think about what's happened to the Republican  Party.  They used to be opposed to Russian and authoritarianism.  Their  nominee is out their praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he  invades smaller countries, jails his opponents and when they interview him,  ask him, well, why do you support this guy?  Well, he's a strong guy.   Look, he's got an 82-percent poll rating.  Well, yes.  So did - Saddam  Hussein had a 90-percent poll rating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Donald Trump responded to President Obama's attack  on Twitter.  He said, \"Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years.   Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez.  He  is the author of the new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance.\"  Good morning,  Judge.  Good morning good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>ALBERTO GONZALEZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Good morning; it's good to  be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I've got to get your reaction to all of this talk about  Russia.  I mean, I seem to remember, quite clearly, it was President Obama  who whispered in the ear of then Prime Minister Medvedev to say, or he was  president at the time, I will have more flexibility, -- tell Vladimir Putin  I will have more flexibility after the election.  It seems there is a lot  more ties between Clinton and Obama and Secretary Clinton than Donald  Trump; correct me if I'm wrong.  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  I think you're right.  We have to remember that we're in this  sort of silly season right now.  We're in a political campaign and there  are going to be outrageous claims, honestly, made by both sides in order to  win political points.  But, obviously, we watch Russia very carefully.   Obviously what they do around the world is something of great interest to  us.  Because they are a powerful nation, they can be helpful in dealing  with certain problems that we need help with, for example in Syria.  So the  notion of having some kind of relationship with them is not a totally bad  thing.  </p><p>But, again, some of the comments yesterday from President Obama, I just  chalk up we're in the political season.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see; so have U.S.-Russian relations changed in the post-9/11  world, where the war on terror has been the top priority?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know, I think (inaudible) depending on circumstances.  I  don't know that I would trust Russia implicitly.  I think we need to --  they could be helpful, but obviously they will be doing some things that  are in their best interest and not necessarily consistent with our best  interest.  So we just simply have to deal with them, I think, with that  kind of mind set.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are obviously were in a very important place during the  beginning of the war on terror.  You are defending that in your new book,  \"True Faith and Allegiance,\" in your new memoir.  What are you trying to  communicate, Judge?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, one thing I try to communicate is all the difficult  decisions that President Bush had to make, and those of us who advised him;  some of them are controversial, but one of the things I hope that readers  come away with is how hard we worked to try to get it right, particularly  in terms of the legal issues that arose.  Many of these legal issues we had  not seen since World War II.  Some of the legal issues we had never seen  before, such as how do you deal effectively and legally with a non-state  actor.  </p><p>So hopefully - you know, I don't shy away from any of the controversial  issues.  They are all in the book, beginning with Guantanamo, military  commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, electronic surveillance,  it's all in there and hopefully the readers will have a better  understanding of the reasons why these decisions were made and the  rationale behind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So once we understand what took place and where we are right  now, the next question is where are we going.  We know that Donald Trump  has talked about expanding the military, investing in the military and  getting tougher.  Hillary Clinton has said she wants to continue many of  the policies of President Obama and that we need Middle Eastern friends  help to actually take down ISIS.  What is the right path going forward?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, I do believe we need Middle Eastern friends.  This is not  something that we can be successful alone.  However, I do worry about the  changing viewpoint about America around the world.  I think we are America.    We are the beacon of hope and democracy and we are expected to lead. I  worry that we sort of stepped back from that.  I think the common phrase is  we are leading from behind.  I just think that puts the United States in a  very dangerous and precarious position. </p><p>I worry that we are less today than we were, say, on 9/11, 15 years ago.   The threats have evolved and I think the United States needs to be very  forceful, in terms of trying to influence outcomes overseas.  I'm not  suggesting we put troops on the ground, but I think we need to influence  outcomes so we don't have outcomes that are contrary to our interests.  So,  I do worry about where we are today in foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you made a decision to support a Donald Trump for  president?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know I'm a lifelong Republican.  I hope to vote republican,  but I'm an American first.  I'm going to vote in terms of who I believe is  best for America, best for me and for my family.  Listen, we still have two  months before the election.  We have three presidential debates coming up.   We've got time to make this decision, which is a very important one because  it is a very dangerous time around the world for us.  Also we have some  serious domestic policy issues that we need to confront, like the deficit.   So, I'm going to make a very informed decision.  I encourage all of your  viewers to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right; so you want to watch these debates and you want to  make sure you're solid before coming out publicly and endorsing the  Republican candidate. </p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on on the Democratic side, Judge, because  two witnesses, yesterday, at a House hearing on Hillary Clinton's email  server pled The Fifth, yesterday, while a third failed to show.  As a  former attorney general, should a special prosecutor have been important to  investigate Hillary's email server?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  That's a difficult one for me to answer.  I do know that the  unfortunate conversation that occurred between Loretta Lynch and former  President Bill Clinton at the airport.  I think that was very unfortunate  for the investigation, and, you know, some AG's may have taken that alone  as a basis to appoint a special prosecutor because, in the end, it's not  about the attorney general's involvement in the case that's important.   What is important is that we have total confidence in the justice system,  that it's going to be impartial in the way it conducts its investigation  and in the decision it makes to move forward with the prosecution.  </p><p>What I worry about what happened here is it appears as a result of that  conversation Attorney General Lynch sort of stepped away entirely from this  case and as a result it fell entirely to Jim Comey.  Most of your viewers  probably do not understand, the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The  FBI Director reports to the Attorney General, and at the end of the day the  FBI is response for investigations.  They present whatever they find to the  prosecutors and the prosecutors decide whether or not the case should move  forward or not.  It seems to me in this case it was sort of turned on its  head and the investigator, Jim Comey, made the decision not to move forward  with the prosecution; and that troubles me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, this is your, obviously, successor, Loretta Lynch.   If you were sitting on your plane, as attorney general, and you got the  message from your aide saying Bill Clinton wants to come up to the plane  and talk to you, and you know that Hillary Clinton is going to be  testifying or - not testifying but doing the interview with the FBI two  days later, what would you have said to your aide?  What should she have  done?  Should she have said, listen, I can't take the meeting?  What would  you have done?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Yes; I think that would've - look, at most you would go and say  hello to the president as a matter of courtesy and say, you know, hello.   Obviously because of the circumstances involving your wife we can't have a  conversation; or it would have been totally appropriate to simply say -  send back a message saying because of the circumstances involving your wife  it wouldn't look good for either the wife or the attorney general to have  any kind of conversation or meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; or how about having an aide on the plane?  Have you ever  seen a situation where such an important position doesn't have someone  taking notes?  There was no one else on the plane.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yes, that would not be unusual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Typically - a private meeting like that would likely occur,  where you would not have anybody on the plane. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I'm getting at, Judge, real quick, actually, have  we become incredibly politicized?  I mean, you see what happened with  Loretta Lynch on the plane with Bill Clinton.  Then you look at Jim Comey  testifying with the FBI investigation.  You look at the IRS targeting  conservatives.  What is going on?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, certainly there's the appearance of politicalization at  the Department of Justice, and that is troubling to me and that's something  that we should worry about and something the attorney general has an  obligation to address because the Department should be viewed as a  Department that operates without any kind of bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; Mr. Gonzalez, good to have you on the program.  Judge,  thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Congratulations on the book.  Be  sure to turn in tomorrow, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, and Indiana  Governor, Mike Pence my special guest.  Back in a moment; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Victims of the 2012 shooting at a Colorado movie  theatre will not be on the hook for the major legal fee.  Cheryl Casone  with that story and other headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl; thank you so much.  Coming up next, conceal  and carry getting more stylish.  How one company is helping women carry  their firearm fashionably; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Firearms and fashion, a combination that  gunmakers have ignored this for decades as they focus their marketing on  male customers.  Background checks for gun purchases hit a record high in  July and growing demand from women have created a new fashion industry.   This is amazing.  These products are designed for women, by women and they  offer a stylish look and practical way for women to carry their guns.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the owner of Nickel and Lace, Marilyn Smolenski.   Marilyn, good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARILYN SMOLENSKI, OWNER, NICKEL AND LACE:  Thank you for having me.  It's  a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you come up with this idea?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well, I was taking some classes with my husband back in 2011  and I just wasn't satisfied with any of the holsters that were on the  market.  They were all really geared towards men and men's bodies, not  women's figures, so I made my own.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We actually have one of my colleagues wearing it this morning,  I'm going to show it in a minute; but how did you get into the firearms  accessory business to begin with?  Did you see this demand out there that  you felt women needed fashion and an opportunity to conceal and carry?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes, ma'am; absolutely.  At the time most of the manufactures  were just making products smaller and turning them pink and that's how they  were marketed to women.  So there wasn't really anything for a woman's body  and for our curves and I definitely saw something, a need there on the  market for new items from women.  So I spoke to some girlfriends that were  in the fashion industry and also police officers and they were really  excited and really encouraged me to go forward with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of reception are you seeing right now at Nickel and  Lace?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Oh, just an outpouring of support.  You know, when I first  started it was kind of a taboo issue here in Chicago, as you can imagine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  -- this is where I'm based.  But, you know, as time goes on or  more people are being supportive of it, especially as the crime goes up in  the city.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us what we need to know to actually wear one of these  things.  What are the particulars and how does it work?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  So the particulars are that this is a shapewear based  foundation, so it goes underneath your clothing, and it has special use  pockets on either side, so it's ambidextrous.  It's meant for a cross body  draw for a subcompact firearm.  So, for a smaller firearm, which does hide  better on a woman's body.  If you're not going to use of firearm, in places  like Chicago you can't carry everywhere, you can also carry your cellphone,  your keys, your id. It's also what I did when I was in Europe.  I was  carrying different items so I wouldn't get, let's say, pickpocketed on the  subway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a different -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  There is a lot of different functionalities to it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has different uses.  Morgan Ortagus, who is with us this  morning, has it on.  Let's take a look.  Morgan, how does it feel?  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  I love the fact that it's  shapewear.  We were just saying backstage you could wear this underneath a  blazer and then you could see the sides, right there, where the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gun would go.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- gun, your cellphone, whatever, right here.  So, yes, it feels  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it feels like it's a shaper.  You like it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It does feel like shapewear.  I might keep it on for the rest of  the show.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well you can keep it.  You can have it if you love it.  It's  yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the next for Nickel and Lace?  Are you planning to  expand this brand -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- or are you going to stay with firearms?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  You know what, we are going to expand to a lot of things but  most things are going to incorporate firearms.  We're working on outerwear  vest at the moment, and it will have conceal carry pockets on the inside of  a fashion vest, either faux fur or suede.  We're also working on a running  belly band for runners, as well as another shape wear but with some lace  and added features to it.  So we are just plowing away with research and  development and making our products better and more useful for women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, no doubt, being based in Chicago you've seen what has  gone on there, in terms of the murders in the violence.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it must be resonating in Chicago?  People want to protect  themselves.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  It really is.  Correct.  Correct.  You know, my sales were more  out of state before, but now, with the rise in crime, I am seeing an  increase in sales, as well, here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn, we'll be watching the developments.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn Smolenski there joining us; Nickel and Lace.  And,  Morgan, you may wear this for the rest of the show?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Listen, you know, shape wear and pistols?  God Bless America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go; coming up, the fast food wars are heating up.  We  tried the Burger King Cheetos Chicken fries but that's not all the  industries doing to being in customers.  We'll talk to the former Young  Brown's founder, David Novak in the next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; good Wednesday morning, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, September 14.  Your top stories right now,  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast:  (HEADLINES).</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

When you do think about what could be happening. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is just saying that Google is impacting your searches on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>Then you think, well, are they also impacting your searches on issues that, you know, favor <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>point of view. I mean this thing just goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like the refugee crisis.</p><p>BAKER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like health care.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC: It's no surprise, Maria, that there's big mistrust of everything in big government and big institutions and big tech. That's why were seeing this play out in this election cycle. People have a fundamental lack of trust in the institutions and organizations and corporations that seem to control our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: They control your lives and Google is in home, it's on your smart phone, it's on your tablet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.

Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH: Did you have a security clearance at that time?</p><p>JUSTIN COOPER, FORMER BILL CLINTON AIDE: No I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: After you left the White House early in -- when did you leave the White House?</p><p>COOPER: 2001.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: 2001. Did you ever have a security clearance at any level after that?</p><p>COOPER: No, I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Was your purpose in destroying the old Blackberry device ever to hide Secretary Clinton's e-mails from being saved or disclosed from federal records laws.</p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman, no. It's not in any way to destroy or hide any information at all. I was going out of my way to preserve all of the information that was on those devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's why he used a hammer to destroy the device to save it.</p><p>Joining me right now is a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Florida Congressman John Mica. Congressman -- good to have you on the program. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R), FLORIDA: Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your takeaway from the happenings yesterday.</p><p>MICA: Well, I think they're trying to run the clock out. We saw one witness not show up, thumb his nose at Congress, two that took the Fifth Amendment and the other we learned some information from -- this has been a cat and mouse game from the beginning.</p><p>We started with Benghazi trying to find out what took place, who did what and we just keep getting the stall and not the information that Congress is entitled to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I mean does this just mean you are powerless in this regard? I mean what are you going to do? One guy, Pagliano, decides it's just not imp. I'm not showing up. He blows it off. You have the other two not revealing anything. And then Justin Cooper, no pushback on the fact that he says oh no, I was trying to preserve information. But we know he's the guy with the hammer. What happens now -- Congressman?</p><p>MICA: Again, we have to follow the law and the rules of procedure. Pagliano did not show up. He can be held as I questioned the chairman in attempt of Congress. A referral would then go to the Department of Justice and there could be proceedings, criminal proceeding possibly against him.</p><p>Right now were looking at the options. I don't know if the chairman will give him another opportunity to come forward. I don't know whether there are other remedies from a legal standpoint we have.</p><p>But again, you see a stalling game. This guy played the same thing with the FBI. We think he was granted immunity, we don't know to what extent. But he should have at least showed up if he wanted to exercise his right like the other two did, he could take the Fifth Amendment before us.</p><p>But again this is just a continuum of stalling; failing to give Congress the information we are entitled to. We are entitled to conduct a thorough investigation. Our committee has charge over all matters for investigations under the House of Representatives. And they are thwarting that process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Good morning -- Congressman. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>had gotten a pass by the FBI. We know this already. But can you tell me what is going on with her top aides? Are you still investigating them in Congress? We saw last week on the show that immunity was granted to yet another person on the server even though we thought the investigation was closed.</p><p>What is going on with the people who are actually in control of this information of this e-mail? We haven't really heard and I think the American people would like to know what is happening to those people in power.</p><p>MICA: Well, we heard from one witness a little bit of information. We are trying to gather all the facts because you can't proceed without the facts. Some information we did learn and we seized from some of the FBI 302s.</p><p>It appears that people like Cheryl Mills, one of the aides to the secretary possibly ordered some of the destruction of the (inaudible) that should have been preserved. We have a requirement to preserve records even though she had them on a private server. She had classified information and other information that wasn't properly turned over and may have been destroyed.</p><p>So we're trying to find out what took place. And every time we turn to another witness, we find out there is more. When they talk to the FBI they suddenly dump new found e-mails. It is a stall to try to run out the clock. And we are, I think entitled to complete the investigation in a proper and thorough manner.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Here's Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. Congressman -- good morning. There used to be a sense that there were consequences for action. And I think there is a frustration out there in the American public that perhaps things just go to the Hill and die nowadays whether it's the Benghazi investigation or any other investigation regardless of where on the political spectrum it stands.</p><p>BARTIROMO: IRS.</p><p>BAKER: Yes -- IRS. What is your timeframe for this particular situation where Brian Pagliano ignores a subpoena, doesn't show up. You know, I realize you have to follow procedures but you're also Congress. And do you have the ability to move at your own pace here and what will your timeframe be to deal with that?</p><p>MICA: Well, unlike some here, we do comply with the constitution with the constraints imposed on us. Even Congress has constraints. So we can't go and prosecute. Now we have to see again what was done in contravention of the law and the rules, take the steps that are allowed under the law. Unfortunately we have a Department of Justice whether it's been Loretta Lynch or Holder that are non-responsive and turned a blind eye.</p><p>We have a very difficult situation, a very difficult job. But, you know, this is kind of like that old law enforcement serial on TV. All we want are the facts ma'am. And our job is to get the facts for the public and then take action. But we have to do that.</p><p>If they want to be lawless our side of the aisle is not going to be. We want to comply with the law and the proper procedures.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But when you say they're trying to, you know, wipe the clock out, you know, let the clock run out does that mean that they're going to just let the clock run out until the end of the couple of months and let the election happen and then they're hoping <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>wins and then it just dies and goes away because she's president. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>MICA: Well, again, they already have control of the Department of Justice. It appears the FBI may have been compromised from there. And it's much disappointing with the Director Comey who has had a fairly good reputation not to give us the information. You may recall during the hearings I said the secretary and her interview recorded. No. Do you have any information from that? Yes we have the 302s. We still don't have the 302s from that and some have been kept from us.</p><p>They are playing a cat and mouse game whether it's the Department of Justice, now the FBI. It's a very sad time for our judicial system and the process that should move forward in an orderly manner under the constitution laws of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What a disgrace for the American people if all of these agencies have become compromised and politicized at this point.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for your insights. We appreciate this.</p><p>MICA: Good to be with you. We will continue this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so will we. John Mica -- joining us.</p><p>Go ahead Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. I think that was very interesting what he just said. It was almost a throwaway comment where he said that the FBI may have been compromised as well. What I would say is I don't know Director Comey's motivation for his decision that he made recently. I will say this. I've had the good fortune of working with the FBI over the years including recently and I know some of those folks. The agents there at the FBI, they are not compromised. This is not an issue regarding the agents or the FBI.</p><p>This is -- and again, not knowing what Director Comey's concerns are -- DOJ, is it political? Of course. But the FBI -- those folks do their job and investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know some FBI agents, too and I agree with you. They are --</p><p>MARTIN: Look at all the evidence we dug out.</p><p>BAKER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What happened to Jim Comey?</p><p>BAKER: You know what, it's a question I don't know where we're going to get an answer to. And it surprised a lot of people. You remember the talk in Washington was all before his decision. He's a great. He's completely nonpartisan. He is the most nonpartisan person there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But the interview was not recorded. The interview wasn't on the record. Basically her lawyers told the FBI look, if you record this she's not showing up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok, we won't record.</p><p>ORTAGUS: And he let Loretta Lynch off the hook two days after she met on a private plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.</p><p>BAKER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Explain that to us.</p><p>ORTAGUS: It's as political as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about this tomorrow as well when we have a special guest. Governor Mike Pence will join us tomorrow, 8:30 a.m. Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Don't miss our special interview tomorrow coming up with Governor Mike Pence.</p><p>Still to come: as Hillary rests, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is on the attack. The details as he hits the campaign trail. We'll tell you the reception that the President got as he stumps for Hillary.</p><p>Plus move over buffalo. We are testing Burger King's new Cheetos chicken. How's that for breakfast?</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 releasing more DNC documents.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria.</p><p>Well, Guccifer 2.0 disclosed the documents at a cyber security conference in London yesterday. They include the Democratic National Committee's finances and network infrastructure. Among them Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine cell phone number and the contact information for several top White House officials. U.S. intelligence officials suspect Russian involvement.</p><p>Well, if you upgraded your Apple device to the latest IOS software yesterday and you didn't have a problem. You were one of the lucky ones. Some people were hit by a major bug that left their devices temporarily useless.</p><p>There are reports that some of the upgrades resulted in a so-called bricked iPhone or iPad. Basically when that happens your device has a black screen and access is totally blocked. Those unlucky people had to plug the devices into their computers, connect to iTunes and restore their devices completely. This is why you should always backup your phone, folks. Apple acknowledging the problem; they later did say that they had resolved it.</p><p>And finally, we first told you about this new item from Burger King yesterday, Cheetos Chicken fries. But they're out today. You have to eat lunch at some point right. So before we dive into them on set because, of course, I brought them, we should tell you that the fries are made with all white meat chicken. They are covered in a flavored breading that includes crushed up Cheetos. Nine-piece order, $2.89 Maria and for all of you watching your waistlines one order is 280 calories.</p><p>And I brought them to try because I think we should try things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm supposed to believe that this is 280 calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: 280 calories -- would I lie to you <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo.</nameText></person></p><p>BARTIROMO: If only our viewers can smell what I smell on this set right now -- wow.</p><p>MARTIN: What's the calorie count? Is the calorie count per the order?</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is 280 calories.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ORTAGUS: You can taste the Cheetos.</p><p>CASONE: You can taste the Cheetos?</p><p>ORTAGUS: I'm from Florida, ma'am. We love our junk food. The taste is great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you taste any chicken?</p><p>MARTIN: This is the breakfast of champions, baby.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just tasty.</p><p>MARTIN: If you have this with the Red Bull and Vodka in the morning your day is set.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER: I'll tell you what, that's the breakfast of champions right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: While you're enjoying your breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you we do have breaking news.</p><p>Bayer is acquiring Monsanto-- the deal is done, Scott Martin as we expected.</p><p>MARTIN: Have fun with the regulators on that one. I mean they blocked so many of this, this year. It's good to see this being done. What's funny about this deal too, Maria, agriculture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: Agriculture prices have been falling through the floor. So it's interesting to see these two companies get together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's $128, $128 a share.</p><p>BAKER: You know what's interesting also is what Charlie Gasparino reported earlier which is if the EU or DOJ or both decide to nix this deal, Monsantowalks away with a $2 billion check. And a lifetime supply of chicken fries. It's a good deal for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at this, the deal is at $128. The stock is still at $106. So go figure. Why is that $128?</p><p>MARTIN: I think the market does not trust the regulators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they don't think -- somebody doesn't trust --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN: This is the biggest deal of 2016, boys and girls and so, of course, the regulators are going to get involved in this. They're not going to let this just walk through.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Well, you've got to get through the Europeans and the Americans. It's not just the American regulators. It's the EU which is just so efficient.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BAKER: Is everybody else eating these chicken fries?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN: Mike's almost out of chicken fries. He knows that --</p><p>BAKER: I'm going to have yours and yours.</p><p>MARTIN: -- chicken fries so fast.</p><p>CASONE: There's honey --</p><p>BARTIROMO: 280 calories -- Scott.</p><p>ORTAGUS: I like this one. This one is zesty and has horse radish. So it's good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: I think the 280 does not include the sauce.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now we hear new information -- Cheryl.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Thank you-- Burger King.</p><p>BAKER: And your fingers are not covered in Cheeto dust.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. I hope you're having breakfast at home with us.</p><p><person><nameText>Wells Fargo's </nameText></person>phony account scandal putting fraud in the spotlight -- what you need to protect your money.</p><p>Plus making a smart home a reality -- the big name Amazon is teaming up with to bring the future to life.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Shares of <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>plummeting over the outrage surrounding the phony bank accounts costing the company its standing as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization. JP Morgan back up to number one.</p><p>Many hold the bank's sales targets responsible for employee creating unauthorized accounts. But <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>CEO John Stumpf is shifting the blame to employees. He said quote, \"There was no incentive to do bad things.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former FBI white collar crime expert Ken Springer and IDT 911 founder Adam Levin. Good to see you gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you. What do you think was behind this because now people are saying if this was so prevalent as <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>-- 5,300 employees creating this phony accounts, are we going to see this at other banks?</p><p>KEN SPRINGER, FORMER FBI WHITE COLLAR CRIME EXPERT: Well, I don't know if it's a fraud or a conspiracy because you can't have 5,300 people involved in that. I think more than anything it's probably aggressive sales practices.</p><p>And I think if the FBI gets involved they can probably talk to some of these people and they're going to find out what really happened. Was it limited to one region? How far up the ladder does it go?</p><p>And I think the bigger issue is going to be if they did this would they have opened other accounts for bad actors -- whether it's drug dealers, money launderers and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we don't know that. I mean we don't know who the accounts were for -- right.</p><p>SPRINGER: That hasn't come out.</p><p>BART: Ok. So the sales targets, Ken, were set by higher level executives. One executive actually is leaving the bank with $126 million payday. Since then <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>has to pay hundred $185 million in fines for defrauding customers. This reported payday that Carrie Tolstedt is walking out with, does this add to the wrongdoing in your view? How does that play into this? This doesn't look good.</p><p>SPRINGER: We don't know. It doesn't look good. And it goes back to I think when Mary Jo White took over the SEC. She talked about not letting financial institutions say without admitting or denying guilt, paying the fine and moving on. I think they're going to see if there's someone who should be held accountable for this violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And Adam, you've got a book \"Swiped: How to protect yourself in a world full of scammer, phishers and identity thieves\". Will you explain to us how we can protect our money at banks with what we see happening.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, IDT 911 FOUNDER: Well, you know, again, here is a situation where the bank ran off with the stork, consumers ended up holding the bag that this system encouraged this kind of action. And the things I talk about in the book is you have to realize this is a classic definition of identity theft that occurred. People were using the personally identifiable, sensitive information of other people for their gain.</p><p>So what consumers need to do is they need to do a number of things. First, you need to monitor. You should be checking your accounts on a daily basis. You should be signing up for what is called transactional monitoring alerts which means that any time there's any activity in your accounts, you're notified of it and you should be specifically looking for small charges or what they like to call ghost charges because usually they are designed in order to evade bank systems and to evade consumer scrutiny.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LEVIN: You should also consider freezing your credit so that nobody including you can get access to your credit for the purpose of opening up a credit card account.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's death by a thousand cuts -- Mike.</p><p>BAKER: What you think is the proper response at this stage? What should they do -- senior management within Well Fargo?</p><p>LEVIN: I think that people have to walk the plank. And I'm not just talking about lower level people. I think higher-level people -- the confidence of consumers has been shaken in this financial institution. And as a result it will be shaken in other financial institutions and don't forget, the scandal that happened a few years ago where a number of financial institutions were reordering the chronology of debit accounts -- debit charges in order to put the consumer over on the first charge to charge multiple over limit fees which is one of the things that led to the Credit Card Reform Act.</p><p>MARTIN: And that's the scary thing. I mean this was going on for years and years and years under Ms. Tolstedt's watch or on her watch and she was able to stay in the position. People were getting fired in her department yet the banking executive did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't look good.</p><p>MARTIN: If your consumer and you're banking at <person><nameText>Wells Fargo, </nameText></person>wow do you feel good about having an account there. The CEO has said he is not resigning. He's not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>LEVIN: But should there be the question, should there be a call back of the $125 million that she's getting as she walks out the door. I don't think you reward people for being oblivious to things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Especially since she's walking out with all that money.</p><p>Ken -- real quick. Final word from you in terms of what we should be looking at for potential bank fraud. You are former white-collar criminal FBI so tell us what we should be looking at.</p><p>SPRINGER: Well, there is a lot that needs to come out yet and probably in the next 24, we'll learn a lot more. But did they really -- we go in and open an account at our bank. Do you go in -- do you sign a signature card? Do you show forms of ID? I don't think that happened. I think they manipulated the system. But there is still the potential for fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because of this culture that you had to meet the sales targets.</p><p>SPRINGER: I think that's what's going to happen. I think the bigger fall fallout is going to be 5,300 people are without a job now. And they're going to be kind of potentially toxic trying to get jobs now as part of this. And what can they do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point. You're going to have that on your resume. Yes, I just came from <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>and this is why I left.</p><p>SPRINGER: But in my experience -- I'm sorry, Maria -- is disclose it. Tell it upfront because you know, it's like Drexel back years, MF Global, people will get over it. Tell them you were part of it and move on.</p><p>BAKER: I think the key takeaway here is pay attention. You've got a personal responsibility. You open an account. You're dealing a financial institution. You've got a credit card or whatever it is, your statements arrive, you've got to pay attention. Otherwise things happen. And as you pointed out this is not the first time.</p><p>LEVIN: No one has a greater interest in your financial security than you do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Bottom line.</p><p>MARTIN: These other people apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ken Springer, Adam Levin -- the book is \"Swiped\" -- thank you so much, sir, for joining us. Thank you very much Mr. Springer.</p><p>Coming up, another secretary of state and another scandal -- the shocking claims surrounding John Kerry's tenure.</p><p>Plus making the Second Amendment fashionable? The company giving new meeting to conceal and carry.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Wednesday morning, everybody; welcome back. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It is Wednesday September 14. Here are your top stories, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast: Breaking news moments ago, Bayer acquires Monsanto, deal is done; valued at $66 billion, that is $128 per share. This was first reported by our own Charlie Gasparino. (HEADLINES) (MARKET HEADLINES)</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>on the campaign trail now for the ailing <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>He used his time in Philadelphia yesterday to slam <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Think about what's happened to the Republican Party. They used to be opposed to Russian and authoritarianism. Their nominee is out their praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents and when they interview him, ask him, well, why do you support this guy? Well, he's a strong guy. Look, he's got an 82-percent poll rating. Well, yes. So did - Saddam Hussein had a 90-percent poll rating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>responded to <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>attack on Twitter. He said, \"Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez. He is the author of the new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance.\" Good morning, Judge. Good morning good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ALBERTO GONZALEZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good morning; it's good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I've got to get your reaction to all of this talk about Russia. I mean, I seem to remember, quite clearly, it was <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>who whispered in the ear of then Prime Minister Medvedev to say, or he was president at the time, I will have more flexibility, -- tell Vladimir Putin I will have more flexibility after the election. It seems there is a lot more ties between Clinton and Obama and Secretary Clinton than <person><nameText>Donald Trump; </nameText></person>correct me if I'm wrong.</p><p>GONZALEZ: I think you're right. We have to remember that we're in this sort of silly season right now. We're in a political campaign and there are going to be outrageous claims, honestly, made by both sides in order to win political points. But, obviously, we watch Russia very carefully. Obviously what they do around the world is something of great interest to us. Because they are a powerful nation, they can be helpful in dealing with certain problems that we need help with, for example in Syria. So the notion of having some kind of relationship with them is not a totally bad thing.</p><p>But, again, some of the comments yesterday from <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>I just chalk up we're in the political season.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see; so have U.S.-Russian relations changed in the post-9/11 world, where the war on terror has been the top priority?</p><p>GONZALEZ: You know, I think (inaudible) depending on circumstances. I don't know that I would trust Russia implicitly. I think we need to -- they could be helpful, but obviously they will be doing some things that are in their best interest and not necessarily consistent with our best interest. So we just simply have to deal with them, I think, with that kind of mind set.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are obviously were in a very important place during the beginning of the war on terror. You are defending that in your new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance,\" in your new memoir. What are you trying to communicate, Judge?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Well, one thing I try to communicate is all the difficult decisions that President Bush had to make, and those of us who advised him; some of them are controversial, but one of the things I hope that readers come away with is how hard we worked to try to get it right, particularly in terms of the legal issues that arose. Many of these legal issues we had not seen since World War II. Some of the legal issues we had never seen before, such as how do you deal effectively and legally with a non-state actor.</p><p>So hopefully - you know, I don't shy away from any of the controversial issues. They are all in the book, beginning with Guantanamo, military commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, electronic surveillance, it's all in there and hopefully the readers will have a better understanding of the reasons why these decisions were made and the rationale behind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So once we understand what took place and where we are right now, the next question is where are we going. We know that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has talked about expanding the military, investing in the military and getting tougher. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>has said she wants to continue many of the policies of <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and that we need Middle Eastern friends help to actually take down ISIS. What is the right path going forward?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Well, I do believe we need Middle Eastern friends. This is not something that we can be successful alone. However, I do worry about the changing viewpoint about America around the world. I think we are America. We are the beacon of hope and democracy and we are expected to lead. I worry that we sort of stepped back from that. I think the common phrase is we are leading from behind. I just think that puts the United States in a very dangerous and precarious position.</p><p>I worry that we are less today than we were, say, on 9/11, 15 years ago. The threats have evolved and I think the United States needs to be very forceful, in terms of trying to influence outcomes overseas. I'm not suggesting we put troops on the ground, but I think we need to influence outcomes so we don't have outcomes that are contrary to our interests. So, I do worry about where we are today in foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you made a decision to support a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for president?</p><p>GONZALEZ: You know I'm a lifelong Republican. I hope to vote republican, but I'm an American first. I'm going to vote in terms of who I believe is best for America, best for me and for my family. Listen, we still have two months before the election. We have three presidential debates coming up. We've got time to make this decision, which is a very important one because it is a very dangerous time around the world for us. Also we have some serious domestic policy issues that we need to confront, like the deficit. So, I'm going to make a very informed decision. I encourage all of your viewers to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right; so you want to watch these debates and you want to make sure you're solid before coming out publicly and endorsing the Republican candidate.</p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on on the Democratic side, Judge, because two witnesses, yesterday, at a House hearing on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>email server pled The Fifth, yesterday, while a third failed to show. As a former attorney general, should a special prosecutor have been important to investigate Hillary's email server?</p><p>GONZALEZ: That's a difficult one for me to answer. I do know that the unfortunate conversation that occurred between Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton at the airport. I think that was very unfortunate for the investigation, and, you know, some AG's may have taken that alone as a basis to appoint a special prosecutor because, in the end, it's not about the attorney general's involvement in the case that's important. What is important is that we have total confidence in the justice system, that it's going to be impartial in the way it conducts its investigation and in the decision it makes to move forward with the prosecution.</p><p>What I worry about what happened here is it appears as a result of that conversation Attorney General Lynch sort of stepped away entirely from this case and as a result it fell entirely to Jim Comey. Most of your viewers probably do not understand, the FBI reports to the Attorney General. The FBI Director reports to the Attorney General, and at the end of the day the FBI is response for investigations. They present whatever they find to the prosecutors and the prosecutors decide whether or not the case should move forward or not. It seems to me in this case it was sort of turned on its head and the investigator, Jim Comey, made the decision not to move forward with the prosecution; and that troubles me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I mean, this is your, obviously, successor, Loretta Lynch. If you were sitting on your plane, as attorney general, and you got the message from your aide saying Bill Clinton wants to come up to the plane and talk to you, and you know that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is going to be testifying or - not testifying but doing the interview with the FBI two days later, what would you have said to your aide? What should she have done? Should she have said, listen, I can't take the meeting? What would you have done?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Yes; I think that would've - look, at most you would go and say hello to the president as a matter of courtesy and say, you know, hello. Obviously because of the circumstances involving your wife we can't have a conversation; or it would have been totally appropriate to simply say - send back a message saying because of the circumstances involving your wife it wouldn't look good for either the wife or the attorney general to have any kind of conversation or meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right; or how about having an aide on the plane? Have you ever seen a situation where such an important position doesn't have someone taking notes? There was no one else on the plane.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes, that would not be unusual.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Typically - a private meeting like that would likely occur, where you would not have anybody on the plane.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess what I'm getting at, Judge, real quick, actually, have we become incredibly politicized? I mean, you see what happened with Loretta Lynch on the plane with Bill Clinton. Then you look at Jim Comey testifying with the FBI investigation. You look at the IRS targeting conservatives. What is going on?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Well, certainly there's the appearance of politicalization at the Department of Justice, and that is troubling to me and that's something that we should worry about and something the attorney general has an obligation to address because the Department should be viewed as a Department that operates without any kind of bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right; Mr. Gonzalez, good to have you on the program. Judge, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We appreciate it very much. Congratulations on the book. Be sure to turn in tomorrow, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, and Indiana Governor, Mike Pence my special guest. Back in a moment; stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Victims of the 2012 shooting at a Colorado movie theatre will not be on the hook for the major legal fee. Cheryl Casone with that story and other headlines now. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Maria. (HEADLINES)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl; thank you so much. Coming up next, conceal and carry getting more stylish. How one company is helping women carry their firearm fashionably; back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Firearms and fashion, a combination that gunmakers have ignored this for decades as they focus their marketing on male customers. Background checks for gun purchases hit a record high in July and growing demand from women have created a new fashion industry. This is amazing. These products are designed for women, by women and they offer a stylish look and practical way for women to carry their guns.</p><p>Joining us right now is the owner of Nickel and Lace, Marilyn Smolenski. Marilyn, good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARILYN SMOLENSKI, OWNER, NICKEL AND LACE: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you come up with this idea?</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Well, I was taking some classes with my husband back in 2011 and I just wasn't satisfied with any of the holsters that were on the market. They were all really geared towards men and men's bodies, not women's figures, so I made my own.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We actually have one of my colleagues wearing it this morning, I'm going to show it in a minute; but how did you get into the firearms accessory business to begin with? Did you see this demand out there that you felt women needed fashion and an opportunity to conceal and carry?</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Yes, ma'am; absolutely. At the time most of the manufactures were just making products smaller and turning them pink and that's how they were marketed to women. So there wasn't really anything for a woman's body and for our curves and I definitely saw something, a need there on the market for new items from women. So I spoke to some girlfriends that were in the fashion industry and also police officers and they were really excited and really encouraged me to go forward with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What kind of reception are you seeing right now at Nickel and Lace?</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Oh, just an outpouring of support. You know, when I first started it was kind of a taboo issue here in Chicago, as you can imagine --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>SMOLENSKI: -- this is where I'm based. But, you know, as time goes on or more people are being supportive of it, especially as the crime goes up in the city.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell us what we need to know to actually wear one of these things. What are the particulars and how does it work?</p><p>SMOLENSKI: So the particulars are that this is a shapewear based foundation, so it goes underneath your clothing, and it has special use pockets on either side, so it's ambidextrous. It's meant for a cross body draw for a subcompact firearm. So, for a smaller firearm, which does hide better on a woman's body. If you're not going to use of firearm, in places like Chicago you can't carry everywhere, you can also carry your cellphone, your keys, your id. It's also what I did when I was in Europe. I was carrying different items so I wouldn't get, let's say, pickpocketed on the subway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a different -</p><p>SMOLENSKI: There is a lot of different functionalities to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It has different uses. Morgan Ortagus, who is with us this morning, has it on. Let's take a look. Morgan, how does it feel?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC: I love the fact that it's shapewear. We were just saying backstage you could wear this underneath a blazer and then you could see the sides, right there, where the -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gun would go.</p><p>ORTAGUS: -- gun, your cellphone, whatever, right here. So, yes, it feels great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You say it feels like it's a shaper. You like it.</p><p>ORTAGUS: It does feel like shapewear. I might keep it on for the rest of the show.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Well you can keep it. You can have it if you love it. It's yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the next for Nickel and Lace? Are you planning to expand this brand -</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- or are you going to stay with firearms?</p><p>SMOLENSKI: You know what, we are going to expand to a lot of things but most things are going to incorporate firearms. We're working on outerwear vest at the moment, and it will have conceal carry pockets on the inside of a fashion vest, either faux fur or suede. We're also working on a running belly band for runners, as well as another shape wear but with some lace and added features to it. So we are just plowing away with research and development and making our products better and more useful for women.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, no doubt, being based in Chicago you've seen what has gone on there, in terms of the murders in the violence.</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it must be resonating in Chicago? People want to protect themselves.</p><p>SMOLENSKI: It really is. Correct. Correct. You know, my sales were more out of state before, but now, with the rise in crime, I am seeing an increase in sales, as well, here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marilyn, we'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SMOLENSKI: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marilyn Smolenski there joining us; Nickel and Lace. And, Morgan, you may wear this for the rest of the show?</p><p>ORTAGUS: Listen, you know, shape wear and pistols? God Bless America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go; coming up, the fast food wars are heating up. We tried the Burger King Cheetos Chicken fries but that's not all the industries doing to being in customers. We'll talk to the former Young Brown's founder, David Novak in the next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\" Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back; good Wednesday morning, everybody.

[Photo/Agencies]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world is facing a parallel threat alongside the COVID-19 crisis, according to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who warned of a \"tsunami of hate\" that has accompanied the spread of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a global appeal in which the UN chief called for international solidarity, he lamented that \"the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering\".</p><p>When Beijing was still tackling the peak of its own health crisis, people of Chinese origin faced physical and verbal abuse in a number of Western countries from those who linked them to the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>Since then, such prejudice has spread like the virus to attack any minority that excites the hatred of the xenophobes\uff0dmigrants, refugees, Muslims, Jews and even the elderly.</p><p>Although the so-called alt-right has been at the forefront of spreading anti-minority smears online, some politicians have contributed to fuelling the phenomenon.</p><p>At a time when experts were warning against labeling the new disease \"the China virus\", United States President Donald Trump did just that, publicly using the phrase more than 20 times in the second half of March.</p><p>Since then the pandemic has provoked a bonanza of misinformation from online conspiracy theorists, who have targeted not just minorities but also individuals, such as philanthropists George Soros and Bill Gates.</p><p>In a recent broadcast, the far-right, pro-Trump One America News Network linked Soros, Gates, the \"deep state\" and China to a global conspiracy to establish sweeping population control\uff0dand even threw former US president Bill Clinton into the mix for good measure.</p><p>More of the same can no doubt be anticipated in a febrile US election year in which the administration appears focused on blaming everyone except itself for the failings of the pandemic response.</p><p>The UN's Guterres, in his Friday appeal, said all societies needed to strengthen their immunity to the virus of hate. And, without naming names, he called on politicians \"to show solidarity with all members of their societies and build and reinforce social cohesion\".</p><p>In the UK, where police recorded a sharp increase in hate crimes against Chinese people as the COVID-19 outbreak took hold, online agitators have aired fake videos that appear to show British Muslims breaking lockdown regulations by attending mosques.</p><p>In France, one far-right website listed the names of Jewish experts in charge of the country's health system and denounced the efforts of a Jewish politician to ease the pressure on French prisons as a plot to \"liberate 7,000 black and Arab cut-throats\".</p><p>In Germany meanwhile, experts warned against the rise of what they called \"pandemic populism\" in which online conspiracists sought to link the health crisis to a range of their favorite political targets. The danger was that even the most outlandish claims could seep into the mainstream media or be spread by unwitting celebrities.</p><p>The UN's World Health Organization, already fully occupied with tackling the global response to COVID-19, has complained of an \"infodemic \"swirling across society.</p><p>Despite the concerns the conspiracy phenomenon is provoking among these experts and officials already working overtime to cope with the crisis, there are some signs of a fightback.</p><p>In Texas, the San Antonio City Council unanimously passed a resolution denouncing bigotry, anti-Semitism, crimes against Asian Americans and hate speech amid the pandemic.</p><p>On a global level, the UN is launching a new communications initiative \"based on science, solutions and solidarity to fight misinformation\".</p><p>\"Fear, uncertainty, and the proliferation of fake news have the potential to weaken the national and global response to the virus, bolster nativist narratives and provide opportunities for those who may seek to exploit this moment to deepen social divisions,\" said Melissa Fleming, UN under-secretary-general for Global Communications, who is leading the campaign.</p><p>The campaign involves providing authoritative scientific information to counter myths and partnering with the big tech companies to get those messages online. It will also work more closely with journalists to combat falsehoods, fabrications and misinformation.</p><p>The UN and national authorities clearly hope the still, small voice of common sense can overcome the fog horn of nonsense, intentional or otherwise, that threatens to dominate the current debate.</p><p>Let us hope it is so. The world can deal with a physical pandemic, but the effort will be that much greater if it has to handle an informational one at the same time.</p><p>Harvey Morris is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/syndigateimages/syndigate/imgs/498/1493/14/158925627513.jpeg\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/syndigateimages/syndigate/imgs/498/1493/14/158925627513.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-174304794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWD-P181-JDJN-64GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 China Daily Information.
