Ook American Tobacco en American Sugar werden op grond van de antitrustwetten opgeknipt. In 1982 werd nog de nationale telefoonmaatschappij AT&amp;T - 'Ma Bell' - opgesplitst in zeven regionale telefoonmaatschappijen, de zogenoemde Baby Bells. </p><p><br/><br/>De automatisering en digitalisering cre\u00eberden daarna nieuwe monopolies, niet alleen in de VS maar zelfs wereldwijd. In 2000 werd Microsoft op grond van de antitrustwetten gelast het bedrijf op te splitsen vanwege een monopolie op het besturingssysteem van computers. In hoger beroep werd het oordeel bevestigd. Niettemin wist Microsoft een schikking te treffen met de Amerikaanse autoriteiten: het hoefde zichzelf niet op te splitsen, als het de technologie zou delen met andere aanbieders. Sindsdien durft geen rechter zijn vingers er meer aan te branden. <br/><br/>De monopolies van de huidige Big Tech-reuzen als Google, Facebook en Amazon zijn veel bedreigender dan die van Standard Oil en American Sugar ooit zijn geweest. Deze bedrijven met honderden miljarden aan beurswaarde en reserves opereren wereldwijd en zijn machtiger en rijker. Ze hebben een zo grote klantenkring dat nieuwkomers op hun markt kansloos zijn. En wie toch aan hun marktaandeel knaagt (YouTube, WhatsApp en Instagram) wordt opgekocht. Ze zijn op grond van de huidige mededingingsregels ook bijna niet aan te pakken, omdat ze hun diensten gratis beschikbaar stellen. Ze benadelen geen consumenten door prijsmanipulatie. <br/><br/>Ze verdienen hun geld met de verkoop van big data en advertenties. Er zijn al diverse procedures tegen ze aangespannen. De EU legde Google in september een boete op van 2,4 miljard euro vanwege machtsmisbruik. Het grootste gevaar is dat ze dankzij hun big data regeringen, bedrijven, consumenten en zelfs kiezers naar hun hand kunnen zetten - of zich daarvoor laten gebruiken. Weliswaar wordt getracht daar in de marge iets tegen te doen, via onder meer GDPR-wetgeving (General Data Protection Regulation), maar dat lijkt meestal op een achterhoedegevecht. <br/><br/>De huidige antitrustwetgeving in de VS is gebaseerd op de Sherman Act uit 1890 die werd ingevoerd onder president Benjamin Harrison (wie kent hem niet....). Toen was de wereld nog heel groot. Nu is het door automatisering en digitalisering een dorp geworden, waar concerns als Google dagelijks miljarden klanten of gebruikers hebben. <br/><br/>Daarom zou er wereldwijde regelgeving moeten komen om te voorkomen dat die concerns de echte Big Brothers worden. <br/><br/>Ook Google zou moeten worden opgeknipt.

Decision-makers must prepare, says &lt;strong&gt;Mohammed A El-Erian&lt;/strong&gt;[/i]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GOVERNMENTS and firms must accept the likelihood of an acceleration of four secular developments that will influence what political and business leaders do and how they do it. If these trends occur simultaneously, they could overwhelm those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a distant concern, about which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent, urgent threat.</p><p>The mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now.</p><p>BP's recent announcement that it intends to achieve 'net-zero' carbon emissions by 2050 - a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings -is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities, but also to tax and regulate polluters.</p><p>Second, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations in artificial intelligence and big data.</p><p>Technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also for use of this information to monitor and alter behaviours.</p><p>Broadly speaking, data are controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), big tech companies (as in the US), or by users (as in Europe). But none of these three operating paradigms provides sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.</p><p>The third secular force is disruption to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.</p><p>[readmore]982715[/readmore]</p><p>The initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by US president Donald Trump's administration - from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism), and from rule-based to more ad hoc arrangements - which was aimed at creating a still-free, but fairer trading system. But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.</p><p>These challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management, and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.</p><p>The final trend is demographic and concerns more than the aging of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend's economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials' starkly different expectations - regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action, and the delivery of goods and services - will persist and deepen.</p><p>For starters, businesses need to be smarter about 'anywhere, any place, any time' delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfillment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become much easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward.</p><p>And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions, from physical to virtual spaces.</p><p>Each of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. And while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers, therefore, must make timely revisions (including pre-emptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.</p><p>Getting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses, and multi-disciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality, and agility is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated, periodic shocks, such as the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>The challenges to sound decision-making and leadership, in both business and government, are not limited to mapping the four secular forces and the required adaptation.</p><p>Decision-makers must also consider correlations and causalities between these trends, which can make their impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.</p><p>Consider another aspect of demographic change: Migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows, which they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.</p><p>The combination of deglobalisation and the misuse of artificial intelligence and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious, non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.</p><p>The world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional, and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs, and risks in their favour.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, where he served as CEO andco-chief investment officer, was chairman of US president Barack Obama's Global Development Council.</p><p>He previously served as CEO of the Harvard Management Company and deputy director at the International Monetary Fund.

He said Jeffrey Epstein was a terrific guy. He said Jeffrey Epstein was a lot of fun to be with. And Donald Trump knew -- Donald Trump knew as he said publicly at the time that Jeffrey Epstein pursued girls \"on the younger side.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton knew Jeffrey Epstein very well. A lot of powerful people in New York knew him very well and they all knew the stories, every one of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS RUDDY, CEO, NEWSMAX MEDIA: I think it's highly unfair of people like you and others, Guilt by Association, whether it's Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Alan Dershowitz just because they knew the guy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The media is trying as much as they can do to connect the administration with a horrific charge against the democratic donor Jeffrey Epstein, trying to make it about Trump, about members of his administration when the real story is that Epstein and Bill Clinton.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Are the journalists investigating Epstein targeting Trump and others through Guilt by Association? Is the press cheering the resignation of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, the former prosecutor who approved a sweetheart deal for Epstein a decade ago? The White House stages a social media summit with conservative critics of big tech who basked in praise from the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP: No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: But can Trump back up his charges? Facebook, Twitter and Google discriminate against the right. Plus, a new book by Mollie Hemingway denounces the coverage of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight and charges there was a double standard for his accuser Christine Blasey Ford. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in New York charged Jeffrey Epstein with sex trafficking and found hundreds of thousands of sexually suggested photos of young girls in his Manhattan mansion. It did more than rekindle the media debate over why he got such a lean deal in Florida 11 years ago. It put journalists' spotlight into Epstein's most prominent former friends.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I knew like everybody in Palm Beach knew him. I mean, people in Palm Beach knew him. He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn't a fan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Bill Clinton issued a statement saying he had flown on Epstein's jet four times, had two other brief meetings, and hadn't spoken to him in more than a decade. Here it is. \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\"</p><p>Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist, a Fox News contributor and co-author of the new book \"Justice on Trial: The Brett Kavanaugh Nomination Fight,\" which we will talk about a bit later; Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Examiner; and Jessica Tarlov of Bustle.com, a Fox News contributor.</p><p>Mollie, Donald Trump was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, as we just heard. He said they had a falling out years ago. Are some in the media trying to imply or insinuate that Trump knew and condoned of his behavior with underage girls?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, AUTHOR, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST: I think the whole interest in the story is because we have this guy who got a sweetheart deal, he had powerful friends, and when the media were able to tie it to a member of the Trump administration, recently departed Secretary Acosta, that made them have better interest.</p><p>But that really is a legitimate part of the story, how he was able to engage in this behavior over a long period of time. It's clearly not -- I mean, yes, he knew Donald Trump, that's clearly not where all of the interesting things will be. I hope they pursue it with other people, you know.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah. He is a rich guy who got favorable treatment and was enabled or legitimized by a whole bunch of other rich, famous glitterati. Same question to you, Jessica. Are some in the media trying to imply or insinuate that Bill Clinton knew of and condoned Epstein having sex with underage minors or perhaps joined him himself?</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT BUSTLE: Yeah, absolutely, but I think they are right to do that. There are number of people -- you know, hats off to Julie K. Brown who broke this right for the Miami Herald --</p><p>KURTZ: I'm glad you mentioned that because more often we don't devote enough attention to good journalism --</p><p>TARLOV: Yeah.</p><p>KURTZ: -- and she got some of these women to go on the record long after everybody forgot the story.</p><p>TARLOV: She also tracked the story, lived off her own money when she couldn't get the expenses covered. So, that's most important here. There is a network of wealthy individuals, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, who did enable this. There is a great New York Times piece about how Jeffrey Epstein was welcomed back into New York society, hosting dinner parties again. How he got in with people at Harvard, Larry Summers.</p><p>All of that is important to the story because you can better understand how young girls were victimized, were raped, because powerful men protected that. So I think this line of questioning is totally legitimate. I don't think the president dodges any bullets by saying, oh, I don't really know him and I'm not a fan.</p><p>Everyone knows about his \"Calendar Girls\" party. Everyone knows about people traveling on the Lida Express (ph). I think journalists should be following this.</p><p>KURTZ: Dershowitz, for the record, was Epstein's lawyer, but, Susan --</p><p>TARLOV: He is also accused of assaulting two women.</p><p>KURTZ: Which he has denied. Yeah, he has been accused and he has denied it. There is a lot of recycling by the press at this 2002 quote from the president in New York magazine. \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. He is a terrific guy. He is a lot of fun to be with. He even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, many of them on the younger side, but that doesn't necessarily mean the younger side could have been 22.\"</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: That's right. The stronger connection is to Bill Clinton and his time spent with Jeffrey Epstein. President Trump allegedly kicked Epstein out of Mar- a-Lago --</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>FERRECHIO: -- for allegedly assaulting an underage woman there and that he worked with prosecutors to help them build the case. There is one part of the story that really bothers me. I am so glad that the Miami Herald pursued this. They do give reporters a time to work on these very important stories. It bothers me that it seems the reason the story got legs again is because of President Trump.</p><p>What would have happened if Hillary Clinton was elected president? Would that story have had legs or would that be the end of it? It is an important question that I think we in the media should think about.</p><p>TARLOV: I don't actually see that SDNY won for this because it has to do with President Trump. I think --</p><p>FERRECHIO: I think she said so. I believe the reporter mentioned that that interest percolated again amongst editors and others because his secretary was the prosecutor.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. Clearly --</p><p>FERRECHIO: Very important.</p><p>KURTZ: -- that as Acosta secretary of labor who was the U.S. attorney in Miami, who presided over his deal where Epstein went to jail for 13 months. It was part time because he could leave every day and go to work. Let me play some sound here. First, Alex Acosta struggling to save his job, holding a news conference at President Trump's direction, and then the resignation. Roll it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX ACOSTA, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF LABOR: Simply put the Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free. Without the work of our prosecutors, Epstein would have gotten away with just that state charge.</p><p>TRUMP: I just want to let you know this was him, not me, because I'm with him.</p><p>ACOSTA: I have seen coverage of this case, that is over 12 years old, that had input and vetting at multiple levels of Department of Justice. It would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about a case that's 12 years old.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: So, Acosta is basically blaming the press coverage. It is true, there was a huge amount of press coverage, given the public revulsion of the magnitude of these alleged crimes and the deal 11 years ago that he approved, that he personally negotiated, not a pretty big and legitimate story.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It's illegitimate story but I don't know if it has been covered that well. Debra Saunders had a great piece in the Las Vegas Review-Journal this morning, looking at how -- the only person to actually get this guy in jail was Alex Acosta. That can be for a number of reasons.</p><p>It can be because the evidence that they had for trafficking wasn't strong enough to secure a conviction, so a plea deal is a better thing. It could be that he -- as has been reported by Miami Herald, that he was serving as a government informant and that he did work that they found sufficiently helpful there, or it could be that powerful people in the administration at that time called him.</p><p>There are still journalistic questions to ask and making it as simple as this guy is bad, you know, because he was part of the plea deal doesn't really go to the fullness of the problem.</p><p>KURTZ: It's been reported, Jessica, that the president thought Acosta did well at the pressure but then saw the coverage over the next 24 hours which was very negative. Another problem for him is that the former top prosecutor in Palm Beach County says Acosta is wrong, that there was a 53- page draft indictment and that that was tossed aside after secret negotiations with Epstein lawyers and Acosta himself.</p><p>TARLOV: That 7:00 a.m. meeting at the Marriott that Alex Acosta what have us believed couldn't have taken place at the office because no one goes to the office at that hour is ridiculous. President Trump was probably the only person in America who thought that that press conference went well.</p><p>There seemed to be absolutely no concern for the real victims of all this which are the young women. President Trump as well when he was first asked about this said he feels very badly for Alex Acosta. He didn't talk about the victims.</p><p>Barry Krischer, who is the prosecutor, said there was a 53-page indictment ready to go. He is absolutely right. You also need to look at what happened to Jeffrey Epstein when he got back in New York. He didn't even have to check in. That goes to Cy Vance. What was going on? How are you overseeing this? If that was a person of color or someone --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Or stands as the (ph) Manhattan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEMINGWAY: -- listed as a sex offender.</p><p>KURTZ: Manhattan, yeah.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And you don't hear a lot of people focusing on that even though he is highly connected in New York circle.</p><p>TARLOV: Julie Brown is focusing on it though which is wonderful.</p><p>KURTZ: And Julie Brown in The Herald has also reported at least a dozen new accusers that have come forward. By the way, it may well be that President Trump did not ask Acosta to resign, that he was going to back him.</p><p>But others in the White House maybe not so much because while Acosta was trying to hang on to his job, there was a leaked to Politico saying that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, wanted him out because he felt he was damaging the administration.</p><p>That is how these things are done. That is how the stage is set. You mentioned the victims are not getting attention. There is woman who came out. Her name is Jennifer Araoz and she had to say on the \"Today Show,\" talking about when she was 14 years old.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNIFER ARAOZ, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER: I just did what I was -- what he told me to do. I was really scared. I didn't necessarily think that he was, you know, going to rape me.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC HOST: Did he hold you there?</p><p>ARAOZ: Yeah. I was terrified and I was telling him to stop. Please stop, you know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: She said she was raped by Epstein. This reminds me almost of the Harvey Weinstein case where more women are emboldened to come out, speak in the media about these traumatic experiences that for years, they just didn't want to grapple with publicly and deal with, you know, sometimes harsh attention of the media spotlight.</p><p>FERRECHIO: It is part of the evolution of the \"Me Too Movement\" and how it's made it easier for women to come forward when these things are in the past. But in the Article Two where it is not just this interview but the article about this interview where she talks about Epstein, describing his trips to the White House.</p><p>I'm really sad that there's no way to search those White House logs to see how many times he visited various presidents because that's another string to the story that deserves to be examined.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah. I do wonder though about, you know, for all of the outrage and public revulsion and I'm outraged. It is sickening to look at what this guy did and is accused of. If he had not happened to have been a Palm Beach pal of President Trump, it wouldn't be getting much media attention at this point.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It is obvious that it wouldn't be getting this level of media attention and it is important given the global network of powerful people and even just how he had the money and how he was financed to enable this lifestyle.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Jessica, briefly, you very much include Bill Clinton in this and I raised the question why is Bill Clinton being targeted by Guilt by Association, but you say it is perfectly legitimate for the media to pursue these questions.</p><p>TARLOV: They have to look at every single man who went to these parties, engaged with these women. If people are on the record saying, you know, we know that he had beautiful women on the younger side, apparently there were these women there, Buckingham Palace had to release a statement about Prince Andrew. This is very serious. This is how powerful people are protected in these networks.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Having said that, it is also important that we don't do Guilt by Association. People could be close to him. And it is important to just nail down these facts. Who was on the planes at this time --</p><p>TARLOV: I am just saying --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: -- and what --</p><p>TARLOV: It opens up grounds for questioning --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Absolutely.</p><p>TARLOV: -- of everybody. If you were hanging out in his mansion and it was described what was going on in there, you should be questioned about it.</p><p>KURTZ: I think you too actually agree on that.</p><p>TARLOV: Yeah.</p><p>KURTZ: I think some pundits have engaged in guilt by insinuation, shall we say. When we come back, President Trump hosts a mini presser on all kinds of topics: Epstein, census, social media, Nancy Pelosi. How much do these sessions help him dominate the news? And later, AOC and three other liberal freshmen, lawmakers and their nasty spat with Pelosi, how the media are feasting on this fight.</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump covered a whole bunch of hot-button topics with reporters when he announced Alex Acosta's resignation, including his decision not to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census in the face of an adverse Supreme Court ruling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think we will have it in the end where it will be actually more accurate than a census. No, no, not only didn't I back down, I backed up because anybody else would have given this up a long time ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Mollie, the president had little choice but to retreat on the question on the census because the Supreme Court had ruled adversely, but is this how he uses his exchanges with reporters to show he's still fighting for his base even if he has certain tactical setbacks?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes. I'm actually not sure that he should have stepped back on the census question and giving up the fight was probably not good for him, but that's why these things are helpful for him. He comes out and answers questions in a certain way to be able to reshape the coverage or to bring things out that aren't going to be covered by the media otherwise.</p><p>It's good that he's very open. It would be good to be able to ask him some more questions about whether it's the census or Paul Ryan or other issues, but --</p><p>KURTZ: Speaking of Paul Ryan, you set up me up nicely for Jessica. So Paul Ryan is quoted in the new book by Tim Alberta saying Trump didn't know anything about government, former house speaker saying he was knee-jerk in his reactions, he always wanted to scold the president.</p><p>President then hit back that Ryan was a lame duck failure, lost control of the House, and he did that in that half-hour presser as well. But interestingly, some of the anti-Trump pundits are faulting Paul Ryan for not speaking out when it counted, when he had some power.</p><p>TARLOV: Totally. I mean, (INAUDIBLE) liberal that I feel about this. There are all of these people who feel emboldened once they leave office or not when they're standing up. Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, like some good you are out of office. So, yeah, absolutely, if you think that he's morally bankrupt and you don't think he should be in office, you have a platform. Use it when it's meaningful. I completely agree with the criticism.</p><p>KURTZ: And so we are going to talk a little later in the program about this increasingly nasty spat between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi and some of other freshmen. The president was asked about that. I mean, I was scribbling a lot of notes here, and he had this to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think Cortez is being very disrespectful to somebody that's been there a long time. I will tell you something about Nancy Pelosi that you know better than I do. She is not a racist, OK? She is not a racist. For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Susan, is this Trump playing commentator in chief and is it a bit odd that he's coming to Nancy Pelosi's defense?</p><p>FERRECHIO: Well, I think that I have a little bit of a problem with that story. I feel like we in the media need to be very careful that we are not generating news, we are just covering news. And I think --</p><p>KURTZ: That ship sailed a long time ago.</p><p>FERRECHIO: I think you need to be careful with stories like this when you're interviewing people on Capitol Hill. Are you putting the idea in the head? I will tell you this. There is no organic feeling on Capitol Hill amongst anyone including \"The Squad,\" AOC and company, that Nancy Pelosi is a racist. This was generated, I think, in the media and pushed by the media because it's a good cookie story.</p><p>KURTZ: OK.</p><p>FERRECHIO: And I think that we need to be careful.</p><p>KURTZ: The president right there wasn't asked a question, do you think Nancy Pelosi was racist, he volunteered that, but you are saying he didn't respond to the media coverage?</p><p>FERRECHIO: Well, in my view, this was the definition of fake news.</p><p>KURTZ: OK. We are going to talk more about that. Also, the president on Friday talked about the ice raids, the immigration raids that have begun today to run up illegal immigrants. Interestingly, I thought he said, well, they will focus on criminals as opposed to people who have broken the law by being here. And so I am just wondering, do they help him shape the news cycle?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Not just the news cycle but the overall narratives. So what is his big issue? It is talking about enforcement of border laws. He threatened he was going to do this several weeks ago, then he backs off and says, \" I am going to give Congress some time.\" Then by the time they don't do anything, which is the least surprising thing ever, then it makes it more credible that they were going to begin these raids and he starts saying, \"We are focusing on criminals.\"</p><p>KURTZ: Brief comment, Jessica.</p><p>TARLOV: I don't think that this necessarily helped him with anyone but with his base. That is what he certainly is looking to shore up for 2020 saying we are going to be focusing on the criminals, these are the ones who needs to get out there. That's in the stratosphere.</p><p>KURTZ: That might be true, but we all cover it all the time and I think that helps in control of the narrative or at least heavily influenced. Jessica Tarlov, Susan Ferrechio, thanks very much for coming by this Sunday.</p><p>Ahead, Mollie Hemingway will be back to talk about the revelations at her new book on the Kavanaugh nomination battle. But up next, Vice President Pence leads reporters into two facilities at the Texas border and complains that CNN's coverage is unfair.</p><p>KURTZ: Vice President Pence took a whack at CNN after visiting two detention centers at the Texas border. Pence spoke with children and others at a family center.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Are you comfortable? Are you being well taken care of? Do you have a place to get washed up and cleaned?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: But the picture was grimmer at a sweltering and badly overcrowded facility where nearly 400 men were fenced in on a concrete floor and said they were hungry and they lacked beds, showers or toothbrushes. Pence addressed the situation with reporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: A temporary facility -- look, this is tough stuff. To be honest with you, I was not surprised by what I saw. And because on the way here, I knew we would see a system that is overcrowded. It is overwhelmed. That is why Congress has to act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: When Pence did an interview with CNN's Pamela Brown, the network showed video only of the overcrowded men center. The vice president tweeted, \"CNN is so dishonest. Rather than broadcasting the full story, showing the compassionate care the American people are providing to vulnerable families, tonight CNN only played video of men in the temporary facility and didn't play any footage of the family facility at all.\"</p><p>A White House official told me CNN made zero effort to show administration efforts to improve the border situation. In fairness, CNN's Pamela Brown asked Pence about the contrast between the two facilities.</p><p>The V.P. deserves credit for taking reporters in to see the terrible conditions at the men center, after President Trump had called The New York Times reporting on one such facility in Texas \"phony,\" and tweeted today that the men's holding center that Pence visited was clear but crowded, and yet he again called the Times story on a different facility in Texas \"fake.\"</p><p>That offensive began with a tweet storm last weekend which the president also vented about Comcast Trump haters at NBC and MSNBC who he said do the bidding of the parent company's top executives. He took a swipe at lying Brian Williams, who \"totally fabricated a war story.\" Williams, of course, is the MSNBC host who lost his job as NBC anchor after making up a story about his chopper coming under fire in Iraq.</p><p>President also went after the weekend anchors at Fox News, declaring them worse than CNN. He tweeted that Fox, which failed to get the very boring Dem debates, is now loading up with Democrats and even using fake unsourced New York Times as a source of information. Part of the news division's job at Fox is to cover the democratic race which at times seems to annoy the president.</p><p>Ahead on MEDIA BUZZ, the president addressing social media companies, accusing them of blatant bias against the right. Does he have the evidence? But first, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accuses Nancy Pelosi of singling out her and other women of color. But does her clout extend beyond Twitter and Instagram?</p><p>KURTZ: The media love a good juicy internal party fight and they also love to talk, right, opine and prognosticate about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, so they are all over the increasingly nasty spat between Nancy Pelosi and four liberal freshmen Democrats, AOC, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar.</p><p>The house speaker started the latest of invecting (Ph), dismissing to them as having no power and AOC hit back telling the Washington Post, \"I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm's distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood. But the persistent singling out, it got to a point where it just outright disrespectful, says AOC, the explicit singling of newly elected women of color.\"</p><p>Pelosi told her caucus not to tweeting at each other invoking a posting from AOC's chief of staff that liking more moderate Democrats are the old southern segregationists.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: They took offense because I addressed -- at the request of my members an offensive tweet that came out of one of the members' offices that reference our blue dogs and our new Dems essentially as segregationists. Our members took offense to that.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Knowing the media environment that we're operating in, knowing the amount of death threats that we get, knowing the amount of concentration of attention, I think it's just -- it's worth asking why.</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you think she has a racial animus? Is she a racist?</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: No, no, absolutely not. Absolutely not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us now from New York, Buck Sexton, a radio talk show host and former CIA analyst, and here in Washington Mara Liasson, national political reporter for NPR and a Fox News contributor.</p><p>Buck, don't the media just adore this party infighting stories especially since AOC ratchet up the rhetoric by saying Pelosi is going after women of color.</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, RADIO HOST AND FORMER CIA ANALYST: Yes. But the media is right here, I think in covering this, because it's more than just the squabble, the intermural fights that are going on here which makes for good copy and obviously good coverage people kind of want to see what's going on.</p><p>There really is a challenge underway inside the Democratic Party between young and old, between far left and more centrist establishment Democrats and in the social media era in which we currently live and I think this is only going to get stronger, somebody like AOC is able to change the news narrative with a single tweet. And so, Pelosi is trying to fight a war in the media with somebody who has a whole new slew of weapons that she can use and she just can't honestly control it.</p><p>So, I think it's important that they're covering this and I think we're just going to see this continue on for a while because AOC is a true believer.</p><p>KURTZ: I agree with most of what you said and it sets me up for my question to Mara, which is in the world of Twitter and Instagram Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a huge star, she become a household name.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. Millions and millions.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. A 29-year-old freshman. But in the tradition bound Houses Pelosi accuse (Ph) them running reporters --</p><p>LIASSON: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: -- she and Omar and Pressley and Tlaib, have no power. They can't even get their bills on the floor. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LIASSON: Well, and they were the only four votes against the border bill. And others are saying hey --</p><p>KURTZ: A $4.5 billion of emergency aid.</p><p>LIASSON: -- totally not right. Only the four of them voted no.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>LIASSON: In other words, if they have some power why aren't they getting any followers inside the House. Look, both outside power is important because that's how you encourage activists and get the grassroots energized and turn out voters but power inside is what counts. If you're going to, a, keep your majority and defeat the Republicans.</p><p>KURTZ: Buck, it seems to me that conservatives in the media love to beat up on AOC and it's good for clips and ratings, it's good copy, and liberals in the media love to praise her and she's very savvy you got to say in drawing attention sometimes by going a little over the top. Do the media overcover Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?</p><p>SEXTON: No, I think that she is able to set the narrative and I think it's because of the following she has and because of what she represents which is this new far-left progressive increasingly Democrat socialist Democratic Party and, you know, I will just say that some conservatives in media see the way that AOC is going after, specifically Nancy Pelosi, with what are pretty clearly, pretty clear insinuations at least of some kind of a racial undertone or racial animus.</p><p>There's a bit of shot for conservatives in the media in the right, saying, you know, this is stuff that goes all the time, it's usually Democrat against Republican, true in the media, true in politics, for this to get turned on Pelosi and some Democrats, maybe now the left will realize that calling people racist for no reason is a nasty and underhanded thing to do and they would be a little slower.</p><p>I don't think that will happen, Howie. But I do think we are seeing the media coverage of this affected by that dynamic playing out in front of us. And I think that AOC is only going to get a bigger voice and Nancy Pelosi - - because there's not going to be a legislation.</p><p>KURTZ: All right.</p><p>SEXTON: I mean, to Mara's point, there's not going to be a legislation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: Let me -- yes. There's not going to be a Green New Deal, et cetera.</p><p>SEXTON: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: But interesting point. But talk about media coverage, it's about to go into the stratosphere because President Trump tweeted this morning that these four Democratic women who, I'm just quoting the president here, \"originally came from countries whose governments are corrupt, why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and climate infested places from which they came then come back and show us how. Nancy will help make the travel arrangements.\"</p><p>So, of the four women only Ilhan Omar she was born in Somalia, the others were born in America. So, Mara, I see the media just completely exploding over this that the president is kind of telling them to leave America.</p><p>LIASSON: Look, the Democrats have formed a circular firing squad, that's what Republicans want them to do. Donald Trump decided to put himself in the middle of that, now the Democrats are rallying around Pelosi against these pretty extreme comments, \"go back where you came from.\"</p><p>Pelosi issued a statement today saying that was really xenophobic and I think he's going to end -- end up helping them solve this squabble at least for the moment, because the one thing that unifies the Democrats is Donald Trump.</p><p>KURTZ: Are the media terms, Buck Sexton, the president also keeps the story alive. This has been going on for a week now.</p><p>SEXTON: Yes. I think that he's -- we're going to see others plays out, Most of what Mara said I would cause on onto and that at least now the Democrats are going to have a shift in the narrative away from their internal fighting here, this wasn't -- this wasn't a good tweet from the president. I support the president, I think a lot of his tweets are actually effective on messaging, this one is just going to get picked apart.</p><p>I would like to see more focus on the border issue but the media is going to have field day with this and it's going to move away from essentially AOC, as we just discussed saying that Pelosi and some very prominent Democrats perhaps along with her, have a disrespect of women of color. Now the Democrats are going to unify around no, it actually all comes from the right and from Trump.</p><p>So, we'll see how it plays out over the next couple of days. But you know, Trump's messaging, by the way, even when sometimes people think he's getting it wrong, we find out that he actually got it right, we just didn't expect it, I don't think that's the case with this tweet, though.</p><p>KURTZ: OK. Rare moments of agreement here between the two of you. Buck Sexton and Mara Liasson, great having you guys. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>SEXTON: Thank you.</p><p>KURTZ: Coming up, Mollie Hemingway's new book says the media were blatantly unfair to Brett Kavanaugh and went easy on Christine Blasey Ford. She will make that case next.</p><p>KURTZ: We have an exclusive first look on last week's program, and a new book that has landed with quite an impact. \"Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\" quickly shot up to number one on Amazon.</p><p>Mollie Hemingway is back. She is the co-author along Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network which lobbied for Kavanaugh's nomination. Mollie, you report that the Trump team heled back derogatory information on Cristine Blasey Ford because the White House felt that any criticism of Ford would be treated as a smear and depict as victim shaming.</p><p>My question isn't that true and isn't it the rationale that women who are victims of sexual assault or believe they are would be more reluctant to come forward if they believe their past will be picked apart.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. These are legitimate questions and that was part of why the White House, not just the White House but also Senate Republicans had this information. They both had ways of people calling in and they were getting quite a bit of information of how Christine Blasey Ford that what people were saying to these people, what people are saying to these investigators, it was very much at odds with that media presentation.</p><p>So, I do think it's important to be careful. It's also important for the media to be careful in how they are telling a story and making sure that they are not being one-sided that they're not leaving out information or they're not becoming champions for one side or the other.</p><p>KURTZ: You and your co-authors spoke to people who said that Christine Ford back in high school, remember this is decades ago, was a heavy drinker, who was much more aggressive with boys than we were led to believe. Did you have any reluctance about publishing that information now?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, we actually had so much more stuff. We spoke with quite a few people who knew Christine Blasey Ford in high school, or knew Brett Kavanaugh in high school and they had incredibly salacious stories. We felt that in order to tell the specifics of some of those stories we needed them to put names with it and when people were --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: They were not on the record.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: People were understandably worried about having their name associated with it.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Because they would say, well, I'm trying to get kid into school and if it comes out and the people, the media would go after me, I'm scared to do it. So, we had those stories, we had a lot of those stories, we felt we needed to pull back on that, while also being accurate and describing what her friends say and what they have said.</p><p>And these are people who don't have necessarily completely negative views of Christine Blasey Ford, they also liked her, they thought she was nice. They just say there was this other aspect and that the way that the media were portraying it was completely at odds.</p><p>And they also say that they had talk to some reporters here in town and that this was not completely not well known but that when they would tell stories they weren't pursued as aggressively as any anti-Kavanaugh story.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Well, maybe they also had the problem that you wrestled with which in fact getting people to go on the record.</p><p>You accuse the media of having an irrational personal dislike of Brett Kavanaugh at that time and despite the fact that seems like a genuine guy who, you know, allegations aside, you know, coaches his girls' basketball team. Why do you think that would have been?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I'm not entirely sure why that was, but just looking at how they handled different stories or even how at some point in the process you start seeing the media suggesting, you know, it goes from him being a gang rapist. You see in USA Today they're running story saying he shouldn't be around children as a coach --</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. Let me quote that. This is something I had missed, Erik Brady, writing in USA Today, that Kavanaugh should give up his school coaching duties, this is during the fight, because a credibly accused sex offender should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around. Did the press call foul on that kind of personal invective?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And in fact, they did pull back on some of that, but just overarching the story was one where any allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, it seemed no matter how thinly sourced would be getting full treatment.</p><p>You know how you want to be careful about victims.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: That's true. It is, reputation is also an issue and you want to be careful about defaming someone or going after their reputation without the goods.</p><p>KURTZ: I mean, people forget. He threw ice in a bar once, and you know, maybe he did or maybe he didn't, but that became like the days' top headline. Julie Swetnick, one of the accusers represented by Michael Avenatti, now has some other legal problems, claimed to have been raped at 10 house parties, who said there were gang rapes attended by Kavanaugh and others. He also said that Kavanaugh and friend spiked the punch at some of these parties, then she was interviewed by NBC, what happened?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, NBC found that her -- she was not such a credible witness but even more than that, NBC actually knew that the supposed witness to corroborate her allegations had denied what Michael Avenatti had claimed about her statement. They sat on that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: So, let's just slow down. So Avenatti said, hey, here is somebody else a friend of Julie Swetnick who can vouch for what she's saying.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: And then what happened?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: They talked to her, she said actually what he is telling you is not what I said, she was very upset. They sat on that for weeks. They had the information before his confirmation vote, they didn't reveal it until weeks after.</p><p>And this is, you know, there are so many different ways the media cannot do their jobs well and omitting information or sitting on information is one of them, or even how I was struck by how and we tell the story in the book of how when Christine Blasey Ford said she had four witnesses to support her account, and all four say that they don't support her including one who's a very close friend.</p><p>And when that comes out that the friend says I cannot -- you know, I cannot corroborate this allegation, the people close to the Kavanaugh's think this is it, finally the media coverage will change.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And the media barely noted that Leland Keyser was not backing up her friend.</p><p>KURTZ: But was there some coverage of the other sides, some coverage when there are questions raised about whether it's Blasey Ford or Swetnick, some coverage when some of the charges against -- or charges allegations against Kavanaugh were not corroborated.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: There was always some coverage.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: But this is just about the deluge on one side versus a little pittance on the other. And so, we need to be -- there's so many different ways that we need to be careful with our coverage including the amount of - - amount of attention we give to one claim or another.</p><p>KURTZ: All right, Mollie Hemingway, \"Justice on Trial.\" Congratulations on the book's success.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Thank you.</p><p>KURTZ: Great to see you as always.</p><p>After the break, a CNN contributor taunted Sebastian Gorka at the White House social media summit. Did he go away over the line?</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump's social media summit was filled with conservative critics of Twitter, Facebook, and Google, which weren't invited, and he said the target was dishonesty and discrimination by big tech, and that it would be covered by the fake news media. Trump argued that Twitter is unfairly reducing the number of people who follow him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We had terrible bias, we have censorship like nobody has any understanding, or nobody can believe, because I millions of people, so many people I wouldn't believe it but I know that we've been blocked. People come up to me and they say, sir, I can't -- I can't get you, I can't follow you, they make it impossible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Joining us now from New York, Carley Shimkus, a reporter for Fox News Headline 24/7 on SiriusXM. So, as I said, you know, it's mostly conservative critics of big tech, some Republican congressmen and women.</p><p>Look, these are left-leaning companies, nobody disputes that, they've acknowledged it, there been times where they have suspended or exiled, or shut, or banned, or minimized conservatives and in a couple of instances they had to apologized. But did the summit make that case?</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS REPORTER: You know, it kind of depends on what side of the aisle you sit on, there was a CNN headline that reads \"Circus show summit, Trump delivers meandering speech to his digital armies of supporters at the White House.\"</p><p>But then Diamond and Silk and Jim Hanson appeared on Fox News the next day they attended the summit, and they said that it was really helpful and they talked about the grievances they have with social media and then the president is going to talk to tech companies the next day.</p><p>I think the purpose of this summit was twofold. One, so that the president can kind of rub elbows with the people that support him the most strongly on social media and the other was to kind of alert big tech and say that regulation might be coming down the pipeline.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes, I think that that is a real possibility and I think they have mostly themselves to blame, such a lousy job of policing their own sites.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: But on your point about the media coverage, even before this White House summit got underway, the New York Times, this is a news story, the guest list has a long critics who feared is bringing together people who decimate threats, hate speech and actual fake news.</p><p>So, you have also the Times tech columnist, Kevin Roose said, these were bunch of right-wing trolls --</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: -- and a motley grab bag of pro-Trump influences. So, he's -- Trump is calling the media fake and they are saying, you invited people who put out fake stuff.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Fake news, yes. It's like mindboggling. So, at the beginning of the summit the president called the attendees online journalists. There were some online journalists there but some of them weren't. There was one person that was -- that attended who spread some false information about Kamala Harris' race, another person who posted this unflattering video of Joe Biden.</p><p>So, some of the attendees were controversial, and I think that's why the White House didn't release the guest list in advance.</p><p>One of the reasons this whole summit received such negative press it's because it's unusual for a politician to be so buddy, buddy with his social media supporters because sometimes they say crude and controversial things but the president sometimes says crude and controversial things on social media as well. And he knows how important this group of people were to him in 2016 and wants to make sure that they are there for him in 2020 as well.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. I think it's fair for the press to point out, there were a couple of conspiracy theorist there.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: On the other hand, because we didn't have the whole list it was hard to reach any sweeping conclusion. But as we play at the top, so the president says Twitter is making harder for people to follow his. He's got 62 million followers by the way, and Twitter --</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: -- Twitter keeps reducing follower account which the company says it's just a periodic reading out of bots and fake accounts that's reduced a lot of people's follower accounts, including mine, including everyone I know. So, is there evidence to back up the president's charges on this point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes. You know, it's interesting in January 2015, the president received an average of 79 retweets per tweet which is kind of crazy to think about because now he regularly receives tens of thousands of retweets per tweet.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: So, he's also been really good for Twitter. I can't imagine them silencing him personally but they have --</p><p>KURTZ: Sure.</p><p>SHIMKUS: -- censored other conservatives and had to apologize for them.</p><p>KURTZ: Zillions of dollars of free advertising from the president. OK.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Absolutely.</p><p>KURTZ: So, one of the people at the summit was former White House official Sebastian Gorka now with Salem Radio and Brian Karem, a Playboy reporter and CNN contributor picked a fight with him. Take a look.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: This is a group of people that are eager for demonic possession.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Demonic. Mr. Gorka, get him.</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You are a punk. You're not a journalist, you're a punk.</p><p>KAREM: Go home.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go, Gorka.</p><p>KAREM: Go home. Hey, Gorka, get a job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: My.</p><p>KURTZ: Carley, can CNN justify having somebody on its payroll that acts like that?</p><p>SHIMKUS: yes. This was, it was almost like a metaphor for how much team Trump and the media just don't get along, it's no surprise that this would happen given the close proximity of the two groups. I think that both sides really displayed some poor sportsmanship, if you will, and both should be reprimanded by their employers.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, Gorka is an aggressive guy when he thinks he's been unfairly accused. But there's simply no question that Brian Karem, a very liberal commentator started this fight and I think CNN --</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: -- might want to take a look at that.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: Carley Shimkus, great to see you as always.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Thank you, I appreciate it.</p><p>KURTZ: Thanks again. Still to come, a very personal and poignant story involving our colleague Ed Henry and why he's in the hospital.</p><p>KURTZ: Ed Henry, my colleague and friend here at Fox News just did a very courageous thing. He went into surgery to make an organ donation to his ailing sister Colleen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, I'm going to donate part of my liver on Tuesday. It's just hard to (Inaudible) because there's a lot of people who need organ donates (Ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of people probably going through exactly what you're going through right now and you sharing the story is going to make a huge difference.</p><p>HENRY: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I give you huge kudos for this, Ed, honestly.</p><p>HENRY: That was few days -- few days ago. And --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got to say --</p><p>HENRY: -- she's really happy there. That's all I want to do to make her happy, to give her a little life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Wow. Ed donated 30 percent of his liver and doctors hope both of them will regenerate full livers and he provided an update yesterday from the hospital.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: It immediately started working, immediately.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.</p><p>HENRY: It's just a miracle. The prayers that we are feeling, I cannot thank -- I can't thank everyone personally, I want to thank everybody now, you've been amazing, I totally underestimated the outpouring.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Ed, you've been amazing, my hat is off to you, and wishing you and your sister a very speedy recovery. Nice to have that live update.</p><p>That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz. Hey, check out my new podcast MEDIA BUZZ Meter.

Yet those moves could take years and face lengthy court challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The desire for faster action is fueling demands for a new agency to oversee the industry, an idea that's gaining traction among liberal and free-market economists in the U.S., Europe and Australia. They say there's plenty of precedent: The U.S. and other countries have watchdogs for specific industries, such as aviation, medicine, financial services and the environment, so why not digital markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advocates say a digital regulator could referee disputes between competitors, set standards for privacy, make it easier to move one's data between networks, and make sure the biggest companies aren't squelching innovation or smothering potential rivals.</p><p>\"If the search engine discriminates against you vigorously enough, you're not alive for very long,\" said Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department. \"You need a regulator to be alerted to the problem on Monday and be able to have a hearing the next Monday, figure it out and keep the victim alive rather than taking two or three years to bring a case.\"</p><p>The European Union on Tuesday took a big step in this direction when the president-elect of the EU Commission enlarged the portfolio of Margrethe Vestager, one of the world's toughest antitrust regulators as the bloc's competition commissioner. As the head of digital affairs, she will oversee such matters as big data, innovation, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, along with antitrust.</p><p>In the U.S., efforts to establish such an agency would be met with many obstacles. Republicans, who opposed the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010, would likely fight another bureaucracy. Democrats may see it as diluting antitrust inquiries. The tech companies, too, would likely try to stop it. An agency with the power to require changes to their business practices could be even more threatening to their bottom lines than budding federal and state antitrust investigations.</p><p>Besides Scott Morton, who led a University of Chicago panel that produced a report on the digital economy in July, supporters include Jason Furman, President Barack Obama's former chief economic adviser who was the lead author of a similar study for the British government.</p><p>President Donald Trump might welcome a digital authority, which could also monitor social-media companies for alleged bias. He has been a persistent critic of Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. for what he says is suppression of conservative political opinions, a charge the companies have denied.</p><p>It's notable that a digital agency was a key proposal in the report by the University of Chicago's Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State. The so-called Chicago School's laissez-faire thinking on antitrust has dominated the approach of courts and enforcers since the 1970s. Many experts now think that stance went too far, clearing the way for industry overall to become more consolidated and for the tech giants to rise.</p><p>To foster more competition, a digital agency could, for example, mandate that companies can't discriminate against rivals that operate on their platforms. It might ban Amazon, on which many third-party merchants depend to sell their goods, from punishing a successful outside vendor by pushing it down in its search rankings. Or it might require that Apple lower its fee for app store purchases of third-party services, such as Spotify Technology SA's music-streaming service, which competes with Apple Music.</p><p>A digital authority was also the central recommendation in Furman's report. The U.K.'s competition authority in July said a new regulator might be needed to police the digital platforms, mirroring Furman's recommendations. A version is under consideration in Australia, whose competition commission also issued a similar report in July.</p><p>Some American lawmakers are warming to the idea, including Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who is a close ally of Trump's. \"It seems that a regulatory body is the right way to go,\" Graham told reporters after a hearing on technology and competition in May.</p><p>Even Facebook's Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has called for global regulations on data ownership by consumers, policing harmful content, protecting the integrity of elections and guarding privacy rights. Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, last week outlined areas where a regulator or other outside group could help improve choice and promote innovation - two goals of antitrust enforcement.</p><p>A regulator could oversee data portability, in which consumers move their data from one social-media site to another. It could establish standards to make sure Facebook users who want to move to an alternative network can easily take their lists of friends, photos and posts with them. Congress did something similar when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which forced carriers to let consumers keep their phone numbers when switching networks.</p><p>A related idea would have digital companies pay consumers for the use of their data. California is looking into it, while Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and a Republican colleague, Josh Hawley of Missouri, back legislation that would make companies publicize the value of the data they hold. If consumers are going to own and sell their own data, a regulator would have to set up a marketplace and establish basic rules.</p><p>Facebook and Google say users can already download their data for personal use, but critics have said the process is too cumbersome, or the data that users are allowed to move is too limited, to represent true portability.</p><p>All four companies have also said they face robust competition and don't monopolize their respective markets or block access to their platforms by competitors.</p><p>Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said the company represents 1% of global retail, including e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores, and that it depends on third-party sellers for its success.</p><p>Apple referred to July testimony before the House antitrust panel by a company vice president who said Apple runs a fair marketplace that has allowed apps, including Spotify, to succeed, and that its own apps face tough competition.</p><p>Some doubt a single regulator could tackle the diversity of issues involved. \"The fact that the businesses are so different and that we would try to slam them all together in some sort of tech regulator\" seems an impossibly hard legislative challenge, said Neil Chilson, a former Federal Trade Commission official who now serves as a senior research fellow in technology at the libertarian Charles Koch Institute. \"It's just not clear to me how you achieve that.\"</p><p>Such hurdles aren't stopping digital agency proponents. Some are calling for urgent action not just to end the tech giants' dominance but also to prevent them from controlling the next tech revolution - artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>\"In every society a lot of the same issues are bubbling up,\" said Gene Kimmelman, one of the authors of the University of Chicago report and a former Justice Department antitrust official. \"It's going to take quite a bit more than antitrust to actually drive competitive forces in these markets,\" he added.</p><p>___</p><p>(With assistance from David McLaughlin.)</p><p>Visit

Yet those moves could take years and face lengthy court challenges.</p><p>   The desire for faster action is fueling demands for a new agency  to oversee the industry, an idea that\u2019s gaining traction among liberal  and free-market economists in the U.S., Europe and Australia. They say there\u2019s plenty of precedent:  The U.S. and other countries  have watchdogs for specific industries, such as aviation, medicine, financial services and the environment, so why not digital  markets?</p><p>   Advocates say a digital regulator  could referee disputes between competitors, set standards  for privacy, make it easier to move one\u2019s data between networks,  and make sure the biggest companies aren\u2019t squelching innovation or smothering potential  rivals.</p><p>   \"If the search engine discriminates  against you vigorously enough, you\u2019re not alive for very long,\" said Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department. \"You need a regulator to be alerted to the problem on Monday and be able to have a hearing the next Monday,  figure it out and keep the victim  alive rather than taking two or three years to bring a case.\"</p><p>   The European Union on Tuesday  took a big step in this direction  when the president-elect of the EU Commission enlarged the portfolio of Margrethe Vestager, one of the world\u2019s toughest antitrust regulators as the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner. As the head of digital affairs, she will oversee such matters as big data, innovation, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, along with antitrust.</p><p>   In the U.S., efforts to establish such an agency would be met with many obstacles. Republicans,  who opposed the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau in 2010, would likely fight another bureaucracy. Democrats may see it as diluting antitrust inquiries. The tech companies, too, would likely try to stop it. An agency with the power to require changes to their business practices could be even more threatening to their bottom lines than budding federal and state antitrust investigations.</p><p>   President Donald Trump might welcome a digital authority, which could also monitor socialmedia  companies for alleged bias. He has been a persistent critic of Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. for what he says is suppression of conservative political opinions, a charge the companies have denied.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWI-20190918B08art1xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28969EBB989C43 NWBKWI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2W-XMR1-JBCN-40W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Conley Publishing Group Ltd.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Yet those moves could take years and face lengthy court challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The desire for faster action is fueling demands for a new agency to oversee the industry, an idea that's gaining traction among liberal and free-market economists in the U.S., Europe and Australia. They say there's plenty of precedent: The U.S. and other countries have watchdogs for specific industries, such as aviation, medicine, financial services and the environment, so why not digital markets?</p><p>Advocates say a digital regulator could referee disputes between competitors, set standards for privacy, make it easier to move one's data between networks, and make sure the biggest companies aren't squelching innovation or smothering potential rivals.</p><p>\"If the search engine discriminates against you vigorously enough, you're not alive for very long,\" said Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department. \"You need a regulator to be alerted to the problem on Monday and be able to have a hearing the next Monday, figure it out and keep the victim alive rather than taking two or three years to bring a case.\"</p><p>The European Union recently took a big step in this direction when the president-elect of the EU Commission enlarged the portfolio of Margrethe Vestager, one of the world's toughest antitrust regulators as the bloc's competition commissioner. As the head of digital affairs, she will oversee such matters as big data, innovation, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, along with antitrust.</p><p>In the U.S., efforts to establish such an agency would be met with many obstacles. Republicans, who opposed the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010, would likely fight another bureaucracy. Democrats may see it as diluting antitrust inquiries. The tech companies, too, would likely try to stop it. An agency with the power to require changes to their business practices could be even more threatening to their bottom lines than budding federal and state antitrust investigations.</p><p>Besides Scott Morton, who led a University of Chicago panel that produced a report on the digital economy in July, supporters include Jason Furman, President Barack Obama's former chief economic adviser who was the lead author of a similar study for the British government.</p><p>President Donald Trump might welcome a digital authority, which could also monitor social-media companies for alleged bias. He has been a persistent critic of Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. for what he says is suppression of conservative political opinions, a charge the companies have denied.</p><p>It's notable that a digital agency was a key proposal in the report by the University of Chicago's Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State. The so-called Chicago School's laissez-faire thinking on antitrust has dominated the approach of courts and enforcers since the 1970s. Many experts now think that stance went too far, clearing the way for industry overall to become more consolidated and for the tech giants to rise.</p><p>To foster more competition, a digital agency could, for example, mandate that companies can't discriminate against rivals that operate on their platforms. It might ban Amazon, on which many third-party merchants depend to sell their goods, from punishing a successful outside vendor by pushing it down in its search rankings. Or it might require that Apple lower its fee for app store purchases of third-party services, such as Spotify Technology SA's music-streaming service, which competes with Apple Music.</p><p>A digital authority was also the central recommendation in Furman's report. The U.K.'s competition authority in July said a new regulator might be needed to police the digital platforms, mirroring Furman's recommendations. A version is under consideration in Australia, whose competition commission also issued a similar report in July.</p><p>Some American lawmakers are warming to the idea, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who is a close ally of Trump's.</p><p>\"It seems that a regulatory body is the right way to go,\" Graham told reporters after a hearing on technology and competition in May.</p><p>Even Facebook's Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has called for global regulations on data ownership by consumers, policing harmful content, protecting the integrity of elections and guarding privacy rights. Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, last week outlined areas where a regulator or other outside group could help improve choice and promote innovation\u00a0- two goals of antitrust enforcement.</p><p>A regulator could oversee data portability, in which consumers move their data from one social-media site to another. It could establish standards to make sure Facebook users who want to move to an alternative network can easily take their lists of friends, photos and posts with them. Congress did something similar when it passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which forced carriers to let consumers keep their phone numbers when switching networks.</p><p>Quote</p><p>\"It seems that a regulatory body is the right way to go.\"\u00a0,Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9445444</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-YNM1-JCM7-R1XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>YALE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) unveiled a \"Do Not Track\" bill with tough penalties for companies who break its protections, reviving a debate over whether users should be allowed to opt out of the tracking and data collection that comprise the core of many top tech companies' business models.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Efforts to create a Do Not Track registry have hit roadblocks for more than a decade, but consumer advocates and tech industry critics say Hawley's bill could find better traction amid a larger backlash against tech behemoths including Google, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gabriel Weinberg, the CEO and founder of privacy-oriented browser DuckDuckGo, told The Hill Americans are more concerned about privacy issues than they were a decade ago, when the first conversations about a Do Not Track registry gained prominence.</p><p>He said those efforts occurred before privacy became \"mainstream,\" pointing to a spate of highly public surveillance- and privacy-related scandals over the past decade.</p><p>\"There's a pressure to pass something this year, I think, because there's a will from people to do something,\" Weinberg said.</p><p>DuckDuckGo earlier this month released a Do Not Track proposal of its own, calling for legislation that would legally require websites to stop collecting data on users who opt out of certain kinds of \"non-essential\" tracking.</p><p>The Do Not Track registry would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list, which allows people to say they no longer want to receive telemarketing calls.</p><p>Weinberg said he was approached by Hawley's office, as well as a few other lawmakers, shortly after putting out the proposal, and supports the freshman Missouri Republican's bill.</p><p>Hawley's bill breaks with DuckDuckGo's proposal on some points, but the basic idea is the same: It would allow Americans to opt out of companies collecting their data beyond what is \"necessary\" for those services to run. And companies would face steep penalties if they fail to respect that decision.</p><p>\"It's very simple: It just says that a consumer can make a one-time choice not to be tracked, not to have her data sent to these companies and to stop them from then selling that data to other companies,\" Hawley said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. \"I think we should make it compulsory and we should give it the force of law. ... This puts the ball in consumers' court, gives them ownership over their own data, gives them the right to control it.\"</p><p>Hawley's bill would put the force of law behind the list, threatening companies with fines of up to $1,000 per person for \"willful or reckless\" violations and $50 per day for \"negligence.\"</p><p>Advocates have long pushed for a Do Not Track database.</p><p>In 2010, the FTC endorsed a Do Not Track initiative, and lawmakers including Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) introduced legislation that would have empowered the FTC to create the list.</p><p>The efforts to create a federally enforced registry, though, never panned out amid enormous pressure from industry representatives, who could not come to an agreement over what \"tracking\" means in the first place. The working group tasked with coming to an agreement on how to implement the pro-privacy registry was ultimately unable to come to a consensus after years of wrangling.</p><p>Weinberg said that at the time, the tech industry was singing a different tune on privacy. For the most part, the top companies were resistant to any form of federal regulation.</p><p>But this year, Hawley is introducing the bill as companies like Google and industry trade groups are getting behind the calls for privacy legislation, seeking to get a seat at the table as efforts to craft a comprehensive privacy law ramp up on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), an ad business organization, was one of the most fervent opponents of previous Do Not Track efforts. The group, which represents advertising and marketing technology companies, sought to quash the effort entirely.</p><p>But IAB last week put out a blog post calling for \"Do-Not-Track Plus,\" meaning broader federal privacy legislation that imposes \"penalties, civil and criminal, for illicit uses of data.\" The group noted that they still believe a federal Do Not Track list would promote \"an incorrect, noxious notion that consumers are de facto victimized by the use of their data,\" but said broader regulations are needed to address the issue.</p><p>But there are still questions about the path ahead. Some expected allies to Hawley's push have not yet gotten on board.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), one of the leaders of the push to implement a registry in 2011, said they are still reviewing Hawley's bill and declined to comment on Tuesday.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), in an emailed statement to The Hill called the Do Not Track concept \"a straightforward approach to a real problem,\" but noted that implementation can be \"very tricky.\" EPIC helped pioneer the \"Do Not Call\" registry.</p><p>Joe Jerome, a policy counsel with the Privacy and Data Project at Georgetown University's Center for Democracy and Technology, told The Hill that he and other privacy activists think Do Not Track legislation would be a \"good step forward,\" but the conversation about privacy has expanded exponentially. He mentioned that advocates will want bills that deal with third-party data brokers, internet-connected devices and the larger \"non-browser\" tech environment.</p><p>Do Not Track proposals have typically revolved around internet browsers.</p><p>\"Do Not Track could be a really useful user control but it doesn't really solve the entire problem,\" Jerome, a leading voice on privacy, told The Hill. \"It's something we should've been doing 10 years ago. The fact we didn't means we have a whole lot of other problems.\"</p><p>\"I don't think a federal Do Not Track solution is comprehensive enough to deal with all of the other political issues at play in the national privacy debate right now,\" Jerome continued. \"I don't think it addresses some of the overarching data security, anti-discrimination, dark-pattern [concerns].\"</p><p>And it's unclear whether other lawmakers will get on board with Hawley's proposal.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a tech critic, and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told The Hill that Hawley had not yet approached them about the legislation. The Commerce Committee would likely have some jurisdiction over the bill, as the panel oversees the FTC.</p><p>A spokesman for Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who included Do Not Track provisions in his draft data privacy legislation released last year, said the office is still reviewing Hawley's bill.</p><p>Blumenthal said he would be open to collaborating with Hawley, noting that he's also supported Do Not Track efforts in the past, and Wicker said he is interested in it as well but hasn't heard about it.</p><p>Hawley's office said they would have updates in the future about co-sponsors.</p><p>Advocates, though, are hopeful for the effort, even as they caution that it is just one step in addressing privacy issues.</p><p>\"I do think, again, a Do Not Track proposal with some teeth could make a meaningful difference for consumers' privacy,\" Jerome said.</p><p>\"I don't think it's the end of the conversation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Today, more than 4 million moms blog. And as any child knows, we can learn a lot -- sometimes about the unexpected -- from our mothers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what might moms teach us about regulating their online activities? Internet regulation can affect mommy bloggers as much as it does big tech companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p> Think about the sometimes-poisonous reader comments found beneath blogs and other online articles. Comments are a useful way to interact with readers and create a sense of community in the digital age. That's part of what makes many blogs successful and the reason some bloggers start or continue writing.</p><p> Still, comments can get quite nasty. It's easy to understand why a mommy blogger might want to remove certain comments, particularly if related to information or photos about someone's children.</p><p> Existing tech laws protect this right. 1996's landmark \"Section 230\" provision made clear that the provider of an internet service -- whether big tech or a blogger offering a comment section -- is not liable for the actions of its users when it is serving as a curator rather than a creator. It also allows bloggers to remove or otherwise moderate third party comments without fear of legal action.</p><p> This is critical for small-content generators and helps illustrate why Section 230 helped make the internet a free space for all kinds of people. How many moms would be able to do some casual blogging if a tense battle over content moderation could land them in expensive, time-consuming legal trouble?</p><p> Mommy bloggers don't just teach us the importance of maintaining internet freedom laws. They also help illustrate the building tension that can emerge between speech and privacy.</p><p> One woman stirred controversy when, writing in the Washington Post, she described her daughter's request to stop blogging about motherhood. In publicly refusing, the author noted, \"my stories will be inextricably linked to her experiences.\" With the children of \"sharenting\" now coming online themselves, parents' speech and their children's rights to privacy will increasingly come into conflict.</p><p> For better or worse, stories or pictures rarely exist in isolation anymore. Requests for extreme privacy measures like a \"right to be forgotten,\" as already found in Europe, can quickly make a thorny question thornier.</p><p> Should legal, legitimate speech be regulated because it's online? Should the child of a mommy blogger be able to grow up, invoke a right to be forgotten, and have her mother's old blog delisted? Does free speech cover sharing embarrassing stories about a child, or should that change in the digital age, where it's no longer contained to a photo album or yearbook?</p><p> These are questions without easy answers. Ideally, families will work them out on their own. But in our haste to call for stringent new privacy rights, we should consider not just how compliance might affect large tech companies but also how it might impact more personal conversations.

Today, more than 4 million moms blog. And as any child knows, we can learn a lot \u2014 sometimes about the unexpected \u2014 from our mothers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what might moms teach us about regulating their online activities? Internet regulation can affect mommy bloggers as much as it does big tech companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p> Think about the sometimes-poisonous reader comments found beneath blogs and other online articles. Comments are a useful way to interact with readers and create a sense of community in the digital age. That's part of what makes many blogs successful and the reason some bloggers start or continue writing.</p><p> Still, comments can get quite nasty, which is why they are the target of plenty of jokes and more-serious criticism. It's easy to understand why a mommy blogger might want to remove certain comments, particularly if related to information or photos about someone's children.</p><p> Existing tech laws protect this right. 1996's landmark \"Section 230\" provision made clear the provider of an internet service \u2014 whether big tech or a blogger offering a comment section \u2014 is not liable for the actions of its users when it is serving as a curator rather than a creator. It also allows bloggers to remove or otherwise moderate third party comments without fear of legal action.</p><p> This is critical for small-content generators and helps illustrate why Section 230 helped make the internet a free space for all kinds of people. How many moms would be able to do some casual blogging if a tense battle over content moderation could land them in expensive, time-consuming legal trouble?</p><p> Mommy bloggers don't just teach us the importance of maintaining internet freedom laws. They also help illustrate the building tension that can emerge between speech and privacy.</p><p> One woman stirred controversy earlier this year when, writing in the Washington Post, she described her daughter's request that she stop blogging about motherhood. In publicly refusing, the author noted, \"my stories will be inextricably linked to her experiences.\" With the children of \"sharenting\" now coming online themselves, some parents' speech and their children's rights to privacy will increasingly come into conflict.</p><p> For better or worse, stories or pictures rarely exist in isolation anymore. Requests for extreme privacy measures like a \"right to be forgotten,\" as already found in Europe, can quickly make a thorny question thornier. Should legal, legitimate speech be regulated because it's online? Should the child of a mommy blogger be able to grow up, invoke a right to be forgotten, and have her mother's old blog delisted? Does free speech cover the longstanding tradition of sharing embarrassing stories about a child, or should that change in the digital age, where it's no longer contained to a photo album or yearbook?</p><p> These are questions without easy answers. Ideally, families will work them out on their own. But in our haste to call for stringent new privacy rights, we should consider not just how compliance might affect large tech companies but also how it might impact more personal conversations. If we don't, courts and lawmakers could settle too many dinner-table disputes.</p><p> As we argue over whether to regulate internet content, let's not forget that fundamentally, this debate is about some of the ways in which we share information with one another each day. Maybe some of those mommy bloggers can teach us how to work out our differences of opinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-9dedda49c9b748feaad6f9f7f1bcc46f460bb1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898A9ED958483 NWBKIA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W22-2BC1-DXVP-V0X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 wcfcourier.com, 501 Commercial St. Waterloo, IA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As Zika continues to spread throughout Central and South America, the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, the question on many people's minds is if--and when--the U.S. might also experience an outbreak. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, earlier in the week said Americans should prepare for local transmission of the mosquito-borne virus. Fauci and other public health officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suspect at least dozens of people will be infected. So far, local and state health authorities have only reported travel-related cases of Zika. </p><p>While the virus spreading on American soil is a frightening idea to many, Fauci doesn't believe the outbreak will become widespread. Fauci's warning comes just a few days after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed Zika can cause microcephaly and other birth defects in infants born to women affected by the virus in her first trimester of pregnancy. In Brazil, where the outbreak first began, more than 4,000 infants have been born with serious birth defects. It's also suspected that Zika may cause stillbirths and miscarriages, and some adults have developed Guillain-Barr\u00c3fnof;\u00c2\u00a9 syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, both autoimmune conditions that target the central nervous system. Fauci's comments also come less than a week after he and Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director for the CDC, held a press conference urging Congress to pass legislation that would set aside approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat Zika. \"Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought,\" Schuchat said. The CDC and other public health experts have forecasted the virus would migrate to the U.S. at some point as the weather heats up in parts of the country and mosquito season begins. A report, published in PLOS Currents: Outbreaks on March 16 by the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research (UCAR), suggested factors such as heat, humidity and heavy rains in the summertime will provide an ideal climate for the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to thrive in the States. They concluded that cities in southern Florida and Texas are at especially high risk for local transmission of the virus. Additionally, the virus is likely to be seen on the East Coast--as far up as New York--and cities in the southern region. Cities along the eastern seaboard, such as New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., will likely be affected, though the threat is much smaller there, the report said.* * * UnitedHealth to Pull Back From Insurance Exchanges, Citing Losses. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (Minnetonka MN), the nation's largest health insurer, told investors it continued to lose hundreds of millions of dollars selling individual policies under the federal healthcare law. The company said it planned to pull out of a majority of states where it offered coverage and would offer policies on the public exchanges in \"only a handful of states\" for 2017. UnitedHealth, which was a late and apparently reluctant participant in the public exchanges, surprised investors last year when it announced its sizable losses, now estimated at more than a combined $1 billion for 2015 and 2016, because of its poor performance in the public exchanges. Policy analysts have been watching UnitedHealth closely as an indicator of whether the new individual market developed under Obamacare is sustainable. Addressing investors, CEO Stephen J. Hemsley continued to offer a pessimistic view. \"The smaller overall market size and shorter-term, higher-risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustainable basis,\" he said. UnitedHealth estimated its losses from the exchanges would be $650 million this year. UnitedHealth reported overall earnings from operations of $3 billion on revenue of $44.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, versus earnings of $2.6 billion on revenue of $35.8 billion last year. The company would not specify which states it planned to exit. It appears to be staying in Virginia and Nevada next year, but it is not known what other states remain attractive. A small unit of UnitedHealth, which offers exchange plans that feature a primary care clinic, is being tested in some states, including Georgia, where United says it is pulling out. Despite the concerns over United's decision, just how much of its struggles are because of a lackluster embrace of the market and small presence is unclear. The company has 795,000 people in its Obamacare plans, a small fraction of the roughly 13 million people who have signed up for 2016. Without large numbers of customers, insurers are unable to demand low prices from hospitals and doctors. They also cannot balance the high cost of very sick patients with the low expense of more healthy customers. The number of insurance carriers for every state has increased every year, Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the exchanges, said. \"With millions of Americans insured through the marketplaces, it's clear that this is a growing business for insurers,\" he said. UnitedHealth closed the week up 5% at $134.13.* * * J... Drug Sales Help Health Giant Beat 1Q Earnings Estimates. Johnson ...hnson (New Brunswick NJ) posted a 0.6% slide in first-quarter profit, but still beat Wall Street's expectations as strong sales of prescription drugs nearly offset a big hit from the strong dollar. The world's biggest maker of healthcare products reported net income of $4.29 billion, or $1.54 per share. That was down from $4.32 billion, or $1.53 per share, in 2015's first quarter. The maker of baby shampoo, prescription medicines and medical devices reported adjusted profit, which excludes amortization costs and restructuring costs, of $1.68 per share. That easily beat the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, who anticipated earnings of $1.64 per share. The company had revenue of $17.48 billion in the period, up 0.6% from $17.37 billion in the year-ago quarter. That also topped Street forecasts for revenue of $17.42 billion. Johnson ...hnson said revenue was pulled down 3.3% by the strong dollar, which reduced the value of products bought in local currencies. Nearly half the company's sales are made overseas. J...aised its 2016 profit forecast by a dime, to a range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share, from its January forecast. It also hiked its revenue forecast to a range of $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, up from $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. \"We're off to a strong start to the year, supported by our first-quarter underlying sales growth,\" CEO Alex Gorsky said in a company release. \"Our Pharmaceuticals business continues to deliver impressive levels of growth, we have steady improvement in our consumer business, and we are seeing momentum in our medical devices businesses, all of which are fueling our optimism for the full-year ahead.\" Sales of prescription drugs, J... biggest unit, jumped 5.9% to $8.18 billion, driven by higher sales of immune disorder drugs Remicade, Simponi and Stelara, and Xarelto for preventing heart attacks and strokes, plus sales of new blood cancer drug Imbruvica. Sales of medical devices dipped 2.4%, to $6.11 billion, while sales of consumer health products such as pain reliever Tylenol fell 5.8% to $3.2 billion. J...losed the week up 3% at $113.34. Shares have risen 12% in the last 12 months.* * * Medical Stock Spotlight: Hansen Medical Inc. (Nasdaq) led advancing issues, soaring $1.08, or 35% over the week, to $4.15. The company and Auris Surgical Robotics, Inc. announced that they have signed a definite merger agreement under which Auris will acquire Hansen for $4.00 per share in cash, or a total equity value of approximately $80 million. The purchase price per share represents a premium of approximately 39.9% over the closing sale price of common stock of Mountain View, CA-based Hansen as reported on Nasdaq on April 19. \"Hansen Medical has developed a technology leadership position in the field of intravascular robotics,\" commented Dr. Fred Moll, CEO of Auris. \"There remains a significant opportunity in flexible robotics and I am excited to combine with Hansen Medical to advance this market.\" Cary Vance, President and CEO of Hansen Medical added: \"We are pleased with this outcome, which we believe maximizes value for our shareholders. The combined capabilities of Auris and Hansen Medical will accelerate the proliferation of medical robotics to advance patient care.\" Elsewhere, Concordia Healthcare Corp. (Nasdaq) leaped $8.50, or 35%, to $32.47 on rumors Blackstone Group LP is considering a takeover of the listed Canadian pharmaceutical company. The buyout firm is in talks with Concordia about a potential transaction, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. Talks are at an early stage and a deal may not happen, they said. Other bidders may also be interested in acquiring Concordia, they said. Toronto-based Concordia said in a statement that it has formed a special committee of the board to consider strategic alternatives. \"The company has had discussions, however, there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur,\" it said in the statement. Shares of other specialty pharmaceuticals companies also rose. Endo International PLC surged 29% for the week, Mallinckrodt PLC jumped 12% and Horizon Pharma PLC climbed 11%. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment. And DNA sequencing company Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (Nasdaq) spiked up $1.99, or 23%, to $10.72 after the company reported first-quarter earnings. Revenue rose 8% from a year ago to $19.1 million and the net loss fell from $20.2 million a year ago to $19.4 million, or $0.23 per share. The earnings figure beat expectations by a penny, but most investors were looking further ahead. Management said on its conference call that revenue will be at least $93 million this year and gross margin will be in the high 40% range. Both numbers were slightly better than expected, and with momentum just beginning for the Sequel System, there could be a bright future ahead. Menlo Park, CA-based Pacific Biosciences launched the Sequel System late last year, and it needs the product to be a success to get to breakeven financially. So far, 79 systems have been ordered in just two quarters--half the number of previous generation systems sold in the past five years. But Chiasma Inc. (Nasdaq) plunged $6.34, or 62%, to $3.83 following the rejection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the company's drug to treat acromegaly, a rare disease of the pituitary gland. The FDA's reasons for rejecting the Chiasma drug Mycapssa closely mirrored the bearish outlook detailed the prior week, ahead of the agency's decision. Mycapssa is a capsule containing octreotide, a somatostatin analog, combined with a \"penetration enhancer\" to allow for oral delivery. Essentially, Chiasma tried to turn a currently approved, injectable drug for acromegaly into one that patients can swallow. Turning shots into pills has long been a technological challenge, and Chiasma hasn't figured out the solution with Mycapssa, according to the FDA's complete response letter which turned down the company's request for approval. If Chiasma wants to resubmit Mycapssa to the FDA, the company will have to conduct another Phase 3 clinical trial, FDA said. And Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq) plummeted $6.15, or 29%, to $14.95 after Food and Drug Administration staff reviewers stuck by their negative assessment of the company's rare muscle disorder drug, further diminishing its chances of approval and wiping out nearly half of the company's value. The reviewers highlighted similar concerns on Jan. 15 ahead of a scheduled meeting of an independent panel of experts advising the FDA on the drug. However, the meeting was postponed due to a snow storm. FDA reviewers reiterated on Thursday their discomfort with the trial design, statistical analysis and overall effectiveness of the drug, eteplirsen. Sarepta is seeking accelerated approval for eteplirsen, which is designed to treat a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). There are no FDA-approved drugs for the disease and most patients die by the age of 30.* * * Theranos Under Investigation by SEC, US Attorneys Office. Theranos Inc. (Palo AltoCA) board member David Boies defended CEO Elizabeth Holmes last week, saying she has the management and scientific skills to lead the blood-testing startup despite criminal and civil investigations of the company by U.S. authorities. Boies, whose law firm Boies, Schiller ...exner LLP is providing legal advice to Theranos, said that the board hasn't felt pressure from investors even as the company comes under scrutiny by state and federal agencies. The company last Monday said that it's under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorneys Office in San Francisco. Boies expressed confidence in Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford University to found Theranos. She is \"clearly equipped to be CEO of the company, and I think she has demonstrated that not only through her scientific bones, but management skills,\" Boies said. Theranos is developing a technology that, according to the company, can run scores of diagnostic tests using only a few drops of blood. The startup has faced questions about whether the technology works after the Wall Street Journal cited former employees who said it did not perform as the company claimed. Theranos has since stopped using its tests while waiting for clearance from the Food and Drug Administration and is running tests on traditional analyzers. Along with the inquiries from the SEC and the U.S. Attorney, Theranos has been investigated by federal health regulators. Inspectors at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Theranos wasn't complying with lab standards, and has threatened the startup with sanctions, including banning Holmes from running a lab business. The company says it has responded to CMS's concerns and is awaiting a final ruling from the regulatory agency. \"The marketplace and the scientific community will determine the company's future, not what happens in the media,\" Boies said. The company's private investors are sticking by Holmes, he said. \"You have some investors who invested early and who have done very, very, very well with the company, where they could today sell their stock for 10 to 100 times what they bought it for,\" Boies said. More recent investors are \"very sophisticated\" and \"have faith in Elizabeth and the company's intellectual property.\" Boies didn't name the investors to whom he was referring. (Theranos is closely held.) While the SEC is known for policing fraud at public companies, the regulator has been increasingly focused on private markets, particularly fast-growing startups in Silicon Valley.* * * Tracking Washington: The Obama administration said Wednesday it would hold off publishing new hospital-quality ratings amid questions from health providers and members of Congress over the ratings' methodology. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was to have started rolling out data last week that could help people compare hospitals based on a star system. Instead, federal officials told members of Congress they are pushing the release date back to July and would continue to talk with hospitals about the way the ratings are compiled. \"CMS is committed to quality improvement and transparency for people with Medicare,\" the agency said in a notice to lawmakers Wednesday. Medicare is one of the biggest payers for health care in the U.S. and has long been seen by different presidential administrations as a way to influence the entire health system. CMS said it was releasing the new timeline \"in response to hospital and other stakeholder feedback.\" The ratings relate to patients' experience of care at almost 3,500 Medicare-certified acute care hospitals, and include measures ranging from patient experience and cleanliness that will be displayed in the form of ratings on the administration's \"Hospital Compare\" website. Consumer advocacy groups had praised the move but said they wanted more information on hospital performance. Elsewhere, a bipartisan group of senators will soon offer a proposal for more funding to fight a Zika outbreak spreading rapidly through the Americas, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran said on Thursday. Democrats and Obama administration officials have urged the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat Zika, a virus borne by mosquitoes that can cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect, among other illnesses. But many Republicans have said they need more information from the administration before approving the measure. In a temporary fix, the White House said earlier this month it would reprogram $589 million of allocated funds, but said this would be insufficient to deal with the threat. Cochran, speaking at an appropriations committee meeting, did not say how much funding would be in the proposal. The Republican said it would supplement the White House reallocation. MondayMorning/April 25, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 16 CORPORATE New AbbVie Hepatitis C Regimen Shows Strong Cure Rates. Although arriving a little late to the party, AbbVie Inc. (North Chicago) is touting impressive cure rates for its new daily hep C combo as it looks to find a bigger wedge in a market dominated by Gilead Sciences Inc. (Foster City CA). The study results, which were presented at the Liver Congress in Barcelona, Spain the previous weekend, show that its once-daily combo treatment of its experimental antivirals ABT-493 and ABT-530 saw cure rates of 97%-100% over either 8 or 12 weeks in Phase 2 testing. The drug was effective across the 6 genotypes of the disease. In patients without cirrhosis who were not helped by an older regimen, 97% of those with genotype 1 and 98% of those with genotype 2 had no detectable hep C virus in their blood 12 weeks after completing 8 weeks of therapy. Patients with the hard-to-treat genotype 3 and no cirrhosis receiving the combo treatment as a first-line therapy also saw an impressive 97% cure rate with eight weeks of therapy. Cure rates of 100% were achieved with 12 weeks of treatment in genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis, and in non-cirrhotic patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6. \"The recent evolution in hepatitis C treatment has resulted in high cure rates for many patients with specific genotypes, but there remain distinct areas of unmet need,\" said Paul Kwo, professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, in a statement released by AbbVie. AbbVie already has a combo treatment on the U.S. market in the form of its next-gen cocktail drug treatment Viekira Pak. The treatment is approved for genotype 1, the most common form of the liver-destroying disease in the U.S., and patients have to take four pills a day. AbbVie will hope that its new offering, should it gain approval, will be more attractive in a once-daily form for all hep C patients. But AbbVie currently has only about 5% of the hep C market--with first-to-market rival Gilead owning about 90% on the back of stellar sales and high cure rates from its two blockbusters Sovaldi and Harvoni. Both can be taken as a once daily regimen (although Sovaldi may need to be taken with other medicines) and collectively both drugs treat all 6 genotypes. These treatments have been on the market for several years and AbbVie is just trying to pull even let alone pass its rival. It will also have to contend with a new combo treatment from Merck .... (Kenilworth NJ), known as Zepatier, which was approved by the FDA for hep C genotypes 1 and 4 earlier this year. Data released last week showed the drug bested Sovaldi in a Phase 3 head-to-head trial in certain patients with gen 1 or 4. AbbVie closed the week up 3% at $61.44.* * * AstraZeneca Joins with Three Partners to Focus on Genomics. AstraZeneca PLC (London), working with genome pioneer J. Craig Venter, PhD, is launching a massive gene hunt in the most comprehensive bet yet by a pharmaceutical firm on the potential of genetic variations to unlock routes to new medicines. The recently announced initiative, involves sequencing up to 2 million human genomes--the complete set of genetic code that acts as the software of life--including 500,000 DNA samples collected by AstraZeneca in global clinical trials. Financial details of the 10-year project were not disclosed but Mene Pangalos, head of early drug development, said the company would be investing \"hundreds of millions of dollars.\" AstraZeneca plans to identify rare genetic mutations involved in every kind of disease by scanning DNA from volunteers who agreed to have their genomes sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records. The project is made possible by a dramatic fall in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. Today, it costs around $1,000 and takes just three days. AstraZeneca will work with Venter's U.S. company, Human Longevity Inc. (San DiegoCA), which will sequence the genomes, including 1 million from HLI's database, and use machine-learning software to find patterns in genetic variations. AstraZeneca, which is establishing an in-house Centre for Genomics Research in Cambridge, where it is relocating its global headquarters, has also partnered with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Finland's Institute for Molecular Medicine. AstraZeneca is not the first drugmaker to start amassing hoards of human DNA in this way but Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, said it was the biggest commitment to date by any pharmaceutical company. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Tarrytown NY) signed a deal with Pennsylvania's Geisinger Health System two years ago to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, while Roche Holding AG's (Basel CHE) Genentech unit signed a deal last year for HLI to sequence tens of thousands of genomes. \"The big thing here is the magnitude of what we are trying to do,\" Pangalos said. \"This takes it to a completely different level and I think it is going to be relevant of every therapeutic area.\" AstraZeneca's decision to embed genomics across its research and development follows a push last year by the company to expand gene testing into areas including heart disease and asthma. Astra's U.S.-listed shares closed the week up 1% at $30.10.* * * Novartis Earnings Drop in First Quarter. Novartis AG's (Basel CHE) earnings fell in the first quarter as it infused investment capital into drug launches to offset lower sales of Gleevec, after a cheaper version of the cancer drug was launched in February. Novartis is counting on new drugs to offset Gleevec's declining revenue, which fell 22% to $834 million. That decline, though less sharp than feared, weighed on total revenue, which slipped 3% to $11.6 billion from $11.9 billion a year earlier. The company said it increased spending on marketing by 1.1 percentage point to 23.6% of sales to promote its newer drugs. It said revenue from those so-called growth products increased 24% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. That extra investment contributed to a 13% fall in core net income, a measure which strips out one-time impairments and gains, to $2.8 billion. Stripping out the effect of the strong dollar, sales were up 1% and core net income fell 6%. Net income for the three months ended March 31 was $2 billion, a fraction of the $13 billion reported a year earlier, when profit was boosted by a $12.8 billion gain from the sale of businesses to GlaxoSmithKline PLC (London) and Eli Lilly .... (Indianapolis IN). Novartis's U.S.-listed shares closed the week up 1% at $76.48. Sales of one of Novartis's most important drug launches, Entresto for heart failure, were still \"modest\" in the first quarter, at $17 million. The drug has so far proven to be a disappointment as a result of doctors' hesitation to switch stable patients onto a new medicine and delays in securing reimbursement from health insurers in the U.S. But the company said it expected the drug to generate $200 million in revenue this year, now that it has broader insurance coverage in the U.S. and Novartis has deployed a larger sales force. CEO Joe Jimenez said Novartis had increased its U.S. sales force for Entresto by 50% to make more frequent visits to cardiologists, a strategy he said had already \"unlocked that resistance to prescribe.\" Another key drug, Cosentyx for psoriasis, has had a stronger start. Revenue from that drug was $176 million. Novartis said growth accelerated in the first quarter due to additional approvals in rheumatic conditions. Mr. Jimenez said he expected that drug, as well as Tafinlar and Mekinist, two drugs for advanced melanoma, to help offset sales lost from Gleevec this year. Novartis's earnings also took a hit from increased investment in its ailing eye-care unit Alcon.BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO. (New York City) said more than one-third of advanced melanoma patients treated in a study of its Opdivo have survived at least five years, providing fresh evidence of the durable benefit cancer immunotherapy agents have for some patients. The study followed 107 patients who were enrolled in an early trial of the drug, which was approved for melanoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Thirty-four percent of the participants, all of whom had failed on other drugs, were still alive five years after treatment. \"This is a new benchmark for melanoma,\" said F. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, and an investigator at Harvard Medical School's Ludwig Center. Dr. Hodi presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in New Orleans. The AACR said a National Cancer Institute database shows that the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma between 2005 and 2011 was 16.6%. Opdivo is one of three so-called checkpoint inhibitors currently on the market. Blocking the checkpoints releases molecular brakes, thus allowing immune system cells called T cells to attack cancer. Opdivo, and a rival called Keytruda from Merck .... target a brake called PD-1. (Both are approved for melanoma and for lung cancer.) The first checkpoint inhibitor to reach the market was Yervoy, also from Bristol-Myers. It targets a brake known as CTLA-4 and in a previous analysis was shown to result in long-term survival in about 22% of melanoma patients. The Yervoy results, and now the new findings for Opdivo, are especially significant, oncologists said, because they suggest, in each case, patients who survive a certain length of time--three years for Yervoy and about four years for Opdivo--are highly unlikely to relapse. That is essentially an unheard-of result in advanced cancer. The treatments appear to have enabled their immune systems to eradicate or take control of their tumors. \"People who have good responses really seem to be protected against their disease returning in many cases,\" said Louis M. Weiner, director of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, D.C., who wasn't involved in the studies. \"This is a mark of distinction in immunotherapy.\" Still, two-thirds of melanoma patients aren't as lucky. But the success that has been achieved has sparked a wave of interest in cancer immunotherapy treatments among drug companies. Hundreds of clinical trials involving such agents, either alone or in combination with other drugs, are under way.INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC. (SunnyvaleCA) reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit on expanded use of its da Vinci robots in U.S. general surgeries such as hernia repair, and it raised its full-year outlook for procedure growth. The company now expects procedures using da Vinci robots to increase 12% to 14% in 2016, helped also by a favorable outlook for prostate and gynecological surgeries, executives said. Intuitive previously forecast procedure growth of 9% to 12%. In the first quarter, procedures using da Vinci robots rose 17% worldwide from a year ago, driven by growth in U.S. general surgery and overseas urological surgeries. Growth in hernia repair was robust, and the robot saw continued adoption in colorectal surgery, executives said. The company is also focused on expanding use of the robot in thoracic procedures, particularly complex cancer cases. \"You are seeing both clinical and economic benefits with robotic surgery use in these procedures,\" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills. Excluding one-time items, Intuitive said it earned $4.42 a share. Analysts expected $4.33 a share. Net profit for the quarter rose to $136 million, or $3.54 a share, from $97 million, or $2.57 a share, a year ago. The company's net quarterly profit had been projected at $3.43 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 12% to $595 million. The company said it shipped 110 da Vinci systems in the first quarter, up from 99 units in the year-ago period. The company said it has made steady improvements in reducing product costs, including for surgical instruments, and expects to make additional progress this year and in 2017. Shares closed the week up 2% at $638.15.RECKITT BENCKISER GROUP PLC. (Slough GBR) reported first-quarter revenue growth that met analysts' estimates, boosted by Durex condoms and Strepsils throat lozenges, and maintained its full-year outlook on better-than-expected sales of consumer-health products. Like-for-like net sales rose 5%, the company said. The health unit, which includes Nurofen painkillers and Scholl foot products, boosted sales 10%, exceeding estimates. \"We had a good start to the year despite continued challenging market conditions,\" CEO Rakesh Kapoor said in the statement. The company continues to forecast growth of 4% to 5% in like-for-like sales for 2016 and \"moderate\" margin expansion over the mid-term. Reckitt Benckiser is seeking to expand in healthcare--its fastest-growing business--as sales of products such as Mucinex and Gaviscon medicines outpace demand for food and homecare brands. Kapoor has said he's keen to make acquisitions in that industry, which he views as fragmented and likely to consolidate. The stock slipped 35 pence to 6,700 pence in London.EXPRESS SCRIPTS HOLDING CO. (St. LouisMO) accused Anthem Inc. (Indianapolis IN) of negotiating their contract in bad faith and is seeking a court order that the health insurer has no right to demand lower drug prices. The allegations, made in a filing in federal court in Manhattan last week, are in response to a lawsuit Anthem brought against Express Scripts last month seeking $13 billion in price cuts over the remaining four years of the companies' contract. Pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts negotiate pharmaceutical benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies. Express Scripts said in its filing that the contract did not require it to offer any specific price cuts, but only to negotiate in good faith. Anthem spokeswoman Leslie Porras said that Anthem believes Express Scripts' positions are baseless. \"Anthem stands behind the merits of our lawsuit,\" Porras said in a statement. Express Scripts pointed to statements made to investors last September by Anthem's chief executive, Joseph Swedish, that he expected only $2 billion to $2.8 billion in price cuts. Express Scripts said it had proposed five price cuts \"within the range\" of Swedish's projections last June, but that all were rejected, suggesting that Anthem was acting in bad faith when it brought its $13 billion lawsuit. The company also said Anthem acted in bad faith by accepting a $4.675 billion up-front payment from Express Scripts at the beginning of the contract, which it said was supposed to let Express Scripts charge higher prices. Express Scripts said that if Anthem does win price cuts in its lawsuit, it should be ordered to repay that money. The case is Anthem Inc v. Express Scripts Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:16-cv-02048.FDA/EMA ROUNDUP: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday proposed a ban on electrical stimulation devices (ESDs) that are used to curb individuals from engaging in self-injurious or aggressive behavior, saying they pose an \"unreasonable and substantial\" risk to public health. ESDs administer electrical shocks through electrodes attached to the skin to attempt to condition individuals to stop harming themselves or being aggressive. Evidence indicates a number of significant psychological and physical risks are associated with the use of these devices, including depression, anxiety, pain, burns, tissue damage and errant shocks from a device malfunction, the agency noted. \"As these risks cannot be eliminated through new or updated labeling, banning the product is necessary to protect public health,\" the agency said on Friday. The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton, Massachusetts is the only facility currently manufacturing and using these devices in the United States, the FDA said. If passed, the ban would not apply to ESDs used to create aversions to other conditions or habits, such as smoking, the FDA said. Elsewhere, the FDA granted GW Pharmaceuticals PLC's (Salisbury GBR) experimental cannabis-derived epilepsy drug \"orphan\" status for a third group of patients affected by a rare form of the disease. GW said on Thursday that its drug, Epidiolex, had been granted the status for the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a rare genetic disorder that causes epilepsy in about 80% to 90% of the patients afflicted with it. TSC is the third orphan indication that GW is targeting within its Epidiolex clinical development program. Orphan status is granted to drugs aimed at treating rare diseases, giving the developer incentives such as a seven-year marketing exclusivity in the United States. There are about 50,000 people in the United States and nearly 1 million worldwide estimated to have TSC, according to the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance. GW Pharma's drug is being tested in four final-stage Phase 3 epilepsy trials, with results expected this year that the drugmaker hopes will confirm the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids, the active ingredients found in marijuana. The FDA cleared Venclexta (venetoclax) as a treatment for CLL patients who carry a mutation known as a 17p deletion and have been treated with at least one prior therapy after a review of just three months. AbbVie Inc. (North Chicago) and Roche Holding AG (Basel CHE) say they plan to start shipping the new product within the next week. CLL is a slow-progressing cancer of the bone marrow and blood and is the most common leukemia diagnosed in adults in western countries, with around 15,000 new cases a year in the U.S. The 17p deletion--which results in the loss of a tumor suppressor gene--is found in around 10% of early CLL cases but upwards of 20% among patients with more advanced disease. A companion diagnostic developed by Abbott Laboratories Inc. is already available to identify patients with the mutation. Analysts have suggested that Venclexta could become a blockbuster product for Roche and AbbVie with sales in excess of $1.5 billion a year. Other potential uses for it are in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma. In Europe, Britain's healthcare cost watchdog NICE said it had changed its mind and decided to recommend Sanofi SA's (Paris) prostate cancer drug Jevtana after the French company agreed to a further discount. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said the improved discount was \"an excellent example of how pharma companies can work with us to ensure that patients have access to all of their treatment options.\" NICE, which has taken a firm stance on the issue of the cost-effectiveness of pricy new medicines, did not give details of the latest price reduction. Synthon BV's (Nijmegen NLD) generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s Copaxone has gained approval in 29 European countries. Using an alternative route to marketing authorization, Synthon secured approval from all 28 EU member-states and the Netherlands, which is where the company is headquartered. Pfizer Inc. has exclusive rights to commercialize Synthon's product in the U.S. The as yet unnamed drug would enter a multibillion dollar market spearheaded by Teva's Copaxone, which earned $4 billion in revenue in 2015. Copaxone already faces generic competition in the U.S. from Sandoz AG, which launched Glatopa last June after a federal court invalidated Teva's patent. And the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs had a banner year in 2015, seeing more than 700 full and tentative approvals, the agency announced last week in its first-ever report on generics. According to OGD, December marked a high point in the history of the program, with 99 approvals and tentative approvals alone. The agency also is close to hitting its target for first actions on Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and clearing 90% of the application backlog by 2017.

Diets rich in fruits and vegetables and whole grains, low in red and processed meats, and low in refined grain were related to lower risk for gestational diabetes and also a lower risk for type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure later, said senior investigator Dr. Cuilin Zhang. Gestational diabetes, which often has no symptoms, affects about 200,000 U.S. women each year. From 1989 to 2011, the researchers tracked almost 4,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II with a history of gestational diabetes. Over an average of 18 years, 1,069 women developed high blood pressure. Women with the healthiest diets were about 25% less likely to develop high blood pressure than those with the least healthy diets, the researchers reported in the journal Hypertension. Fiber from whole grains and legumes could help improve the way the body processes sugar and handles inflammation, said Zhang, who works at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health in Rockville, MD. Fruits and vegetables contain high potassium and vitamin K, ascorbic acid and antioxidants, which could help the heart and blood vessels, she added. The new results are not surprising, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell of Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston Salem, NC, who was not part of the new study. \"The healthy diets in this study all emphasize nutrients (fruits and vegetables, fresh vs. non-processed food) that are high in potassium and low in sodium, both of which can help lower blood pressure,\" Bushnell said, according to Reuters. High blood pressure \"is the single-most modifiable risk factor for stroke, so avoiding (it) will help reduce the risk for stroke,\" she said. \"Other major conditions associated with (high blood pressure) include heart disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, all of which shorten the life expectancy.\" Women should discuss their history of gestational diabetes with their doctors, Bushnell said. And doctors should encourage women who had diabetes in pregnancy to adopt a healthy diet after giving birth, Zhang said.New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term \"mini-strokes\" offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half. The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris said, according to Reuters. That's because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days. \"You should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,\" Amarenco said. \"The study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,\" write Drs. Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, in an accompanying editorial. The ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for up to five years. The study didn't include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it \"helps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,\" said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association. Any kind of mini-stroke \"should lead you to be evaluated,\" said Arnett, who was not involved in the study. Research reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10% two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8% and 20% for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset. But in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5% at two days, 2.1% at seven days and 3.7% at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively. One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1%. \"Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50% lower than those reported in previous studies,\" Sacco and Rundek write.Although many experts believe Type 2 diabetes is an incurable disease that gets worse with time, new research raises the fascinating possibility that drastic changes in diet may reverse the disease in some people. Recently, a small clinical trial in England studied the effects of a strict liquid diet on 30 people who had lived with Type 2 diabetes for up to 23 years. Nearly half of those studied had a remission that lasted six months after the diet was over. While the study was small, the finding offers hope to millions who have been told they must live with the intractable disease. \"This is a radical change in our understanding of Type 2 diabetes,\" said Dr. Roy Taylor, a professor at Newcastle University in England and the study's senior author. \"If we can get across the message that \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2euro;\u00c2tilde;yes, this is a reversible disease--that you will have no more diabetes medications, no more sitting in doctors' rooms, no more excess health charges'--that is enormously motivating.\" It is not the first time that people have reversed type 2 diabetes by losing a lot of weight shortly after a diagnosis. Studies have also shown that obese individuals who have bariatric surgery frequently see the condition vanish even before they lose very much weight. The new study, however, published in Diabetes Care, proved the Type 2 diabetes reversal after diet can persist for at least half a year as long as patients keep weight off, and can occur in people who have had the disease for many years. The researchers followed the participants after they had completed an eight-week low-calorie-milkshake diet and returned to normal eating. Six months later, those who had gone into remission immediately after the diet were still diabetes-free. Though most of those who reversed the disease had had it for less than four years, some had been diabetic for more than eight years. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body cannot use insulin properly or make enough insulin, so the body cannot properly use or store glucose (a form of sugar) and sugar backs up into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels. In the United States, some 8.9% of adults 20 and older have been found to have diabetes, and health officials estimate that another 3.5% have undiagnosed diabetes. Although no one knows exactly why the diet appeared to reverse diabetes, Dr. Taylor said the explanation may be related to how the body stores fat.Commonly used drugs for problems like colds, allergies, depression, high blood pressure and heart disease have long been linked to cognitive impairment and dementia. Now researchers have some fresh evidence that may help explain the connection. The drugs, known as anticholinergics, stop a chemical called acetylcholine from working properly in the nervous system. By doing so, they can relieve unpleasant gastrointestinal, respiratory or urinary symptoms, for example. The list of such drugs is long. Among them: Benadryl for allergies, the antidepressant Paxil and the antipsychotic Zyprexa, Dimetapp for colds and the sleep aid Unisom. In the new analysis, researchers looked at brain scans and cognitive test results from 451 older adults--including 60 who had been taking anticholinergic drugs for at least a month. The study participants were about 73 years old on average. None of them had been diagnosed with cognitive problems like Alzheimer's disease or dementia. But brain scans of people who used anticholinergic drugs showed lower levels of glucose processing in the brain--an indicator of brain activity--in a region of the brain associated with memory that's also affected early in the course of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, patients who used these commonly prescribed medications had reduced brain volume and thickness in some regions linked to cognitive function, the researchers report in JAMA Neurology. People who used these drugs also scored lower on tests of immediate memory recall and executive function compared to people who weren't using these drugs, researchers found. \"There are definitely medical benefits to all of the anticholinergic medications we looked at, which could outweigh the cognitive risks,\" said lead study author Shannon Risacher of the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. \"But if alternative therapies are available that provide effective treatment of these conditions, patients and doctors might want to consider avoiding anticholinergic medications,\" Risacher added. The study can't prove the anticholinergics were the cause of participants' brain and memory differences. MondayMorning/April 25, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 16NEWS BRIEFS Life expectancy declined slightly for white Americans in 2014, according to new federal data, a troubling sign that distress among younger and middle-age whites who are dying at ever-higher rates from drug overdoses is lowering average life spans for the white population as a whole. The new federal data, drawn from all deaths recorded in the country in 2014, showed that life expectancy for whites dropped to 78.8 years in 2014 from 78.9 in 2013. Men and women had declines, but because of statistical rounding, the decline did not appear as sharp among men. Life expectancy for women fell to 81.1 in 2014 from 81.2 in 2013. The average life span for men also fell, but not enough to sink below 76.5 years, their life expectancy in 2013. \"The increase in death in this segment of the population was great enough to affect life expectancy at birth for the whole group,\" said Elizabeth Arias, the statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics who analyzed the data, referring to whites from their mid-20s to their mid-50s. \"That is very unusual.\" Dr. Arias, who is preparing a larger study of mortality trends over the past 15 years, said drug overdoses, liver disease and suicide were the main drivers of the gloomy trends among whites in recent years, a pattern also found by other researchers. Life expectancy for whites had been rising for decades, but it has stagnated in recent years. It inched up in 2010 and 2011, and was flat in 2012 and 2013. Recent research has documented surprising increases in death rates among less educated whites. Last November, a paper in the Proceedings of the National Institute of Sciences by Princeton's Anne Case and Angus Deaton documented rising death rates among middle-age white Americans, particularly those with no more than a high school education. Other research has found rising rates among younger whites. The pattern had puzzled demographers, but the recent analyses have pointed to suffering and anxiety among working-class whites. In contrast, life expectancy for blacks rose to 75.6 in 2014 from 75.5 in the previous year. Blacks have gained more than a year of life expectancy since 2008. Black men had the biggest increase of all the groups in 2014, rising to 72.2 from 71.8. For Hispanics, life expectancy jumped to 81.8 in 2014 from 81.6 in 2013. Hispanic women had even more pronounced gains, with life expectancy rising to 84 years from 83.8 in 2013. Overall, Hispanics, like blacks, have gained one year of life expectancy since 2008. The overall life expectancy for Americans, 78.8, remained unchanged.The first full year of the Affordable Care Act brought historic increases in coverage for low-wage workers and others who have long been left out of the healthcare system, a New York Times analysis has found. Immigrants of all backgrounds--including more than a million legal residents who are not citizens--had the sharpest rise in coverage rates. Hispanics, a coveted group of voters this election year, accounted for nearly a third of the increase in adults with insurance. That was the single largest share of any racial or ethnic group, far greater than their 17% share of the population. Low-wage workers, who did not have enough clout in the labor market to demand insurance, saw sharp increases. Coverage rates jumped for cooks, dishwashers, waiters, as well as for hairdressers and cashiers. Minorities, who disproportionately worked in low-wage jobs, had large gains. The healthcare law was one of the most bitterly contested pieces of legislation in the country's history. It remains controversial because of its costs to both taxpayers and insurance customers. The high premiums and high deductibles of many plans still make coverage a crushing financial burden for some families. Most troubling, however, is the law is not close to achieving the goal of universal coverage, in part because 19 states have declined to expand their Medicaid programs for the poor, an option the Supreme Court granted them in a landmark 2012 case. Nevertheless, the Times' analysis shows that by the end of that first full year, 2014, so many low-income people gained coverage that it halted the decades-long expansion of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the American health insurance system, a striking change at a time when disparities between rich and poor are growing in many areas. \"The law has clearly reduced broad measures of inequality,\" said David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, who served in the Clinton administration and advised the 2008 Obama campaign on health issues. \"These are people who blend into the background of the economy. They are cleaning your hotel room, making your sandwich. The law has helped this population enormously.\"Researchers, writing in the journal Heart, pooled data from 23 studies and found that social isolation or feelings of loneliness were tied to an increased risk for coronary heart disease and stroke. The studies included data from 181,006 men and women 18 and older. There were 4,628 coronary events and 3,002 strokes in follow-up periods ranging from three to 21 years. Three of the papers measured loneliness, 18 looked at social isolation and two included both. Social isolation and loneliness were determined with questionnaires; the researchers depended on medical records and death certificates for determining coronary events and stroke. The scientists found that loneliness and social isolation increased the relative risk of having a heart attack, angina or a death from heart disease by 29%, and the risk of stroke by 32%. There were no differences between men and women. \"People have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,\" said the lead author, Nicole K. Valtorta, a research fellow at the University of York in England. \"Our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place.\" Future studies are needed to investigate whether interventions targeting loneliness and social isolation can help to prevent two of the leading causes of death and disability in high-income countries, they said. The authors acknowledge that this was a review of observational studies and did not establish cause and effect.Suicide in the United States has surged to the highest levels in nearly 30 years, a federal data analysis has found, with increases in every age group except older adults. The rise was particularly steep for women. It was also substantial among middle-aged Americans, sending a signal of deep anguish from a group whose suicide rates had been stable or falling since the 1950s. The suicide rate for middle-aged women, ages 45 to 64, jumped by 63% over the period of the study, while it rose by 43% for men in that age range, the sharpest increase for males of any age. The overall suicide rate rose by 24% from 1999 to 2014, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which released the study on Friday. The increases were so widespread that they lifted the nation's suicide rate to 13 per 100,000 people, the highest since 1986. The rate rose by 2% a year starting in 2006, double the annual rise in the earlier period of the study. In all, 42,773 people died from suicide in 2014, compared with 29,199 in 1999. From 1999 to 2014, suicide rates in the United States rose among most age groups. Men and women from 45 to 64 had a sharp increase. Rates fell among those age 75 and older. \"It's really stunning to see such a large increase in suicide rates affecting virtually every age group,\" said Katherine Hempstead, senior adviser for health care at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who has identified a link between suicides in middle age and rising rates of distress about jobs and personal finances. Researchers also found an alarming increase among girls 10 to 14, whose suicide rate, while still very low, had tripled. The number of girls who killed themselves rose to 150 in 2014 from 50 in 1999. \"This one certainly jumped out,\" said Sally Curtin, a statistician at the center and an author of the report. American Indians had the sharpest rise of all racial and ethnic groups, with rates rising by 89% for women and 38% for men. White middle-aged women had an increase of 80%. The rate declined for just one racial group: black men. And it declined for only one age group: men and women over 75. The data analysis provided fresh evidence of suffering among white Americans. Recent research has highlighted the plight of less educated whites, showing surges in deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, liver disease and alcohol poisoning, particularly among those with a high school education or less. The new report did not break down suicide rates by education, but researchers who reviewed the analysis said the patterns in age and race were consistent with that recent research and painted a picture of desperation for many in American society. \"This is part of the larger emerging pattern of evidence of the links between poverty, hopelessness and health,\" said Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard and the author of \"Our Kids,\" an investigation of new class divisions in America.

The software giant already took its turn through the regulatory wringer starting two decades ago, a years-long confrontation that resulted in the finding that the Redmond, Wash., company had illegally maintained its monopoly for personal-computer operating-system software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The case dealt with the company's moves to kneecap the Netscape web browser by bundling its own product, Internet Explorer, into Windows, the dominant PC operating system. A federal judge ordered the company split in two in 2000, a fate Microsoft avoided when an appeals court reversed that part of the ruling and the company eventually settled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That 2002 settlement led to nine years of court supervision of the company's business practices and required Microsoft to give the top 20 computer makers identical contract terms for licensing Windows, and gave computer makers greater freedom to promote non-Microsoft products such as browsers and media-playing software.</p><p>Because observers and legal pundits almost uniformly agree the software giant did virtually everything wrong in the course of the investigation -- which had its start as early as 1990, followed by a 1998 Justice Department lawsuit -- in retrospect its story serves as a useful instruction manual of what not to do.</p><p>Though no formal inquiries have yet been opened, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department carved up the territory of big tech -- Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. -- as they prepare to dig in on antitrust issues.</p><p>The Justice Department will look at Google, which dominates the online search and advertising spaces, and Apple, whose pervasive App Store is likely to be under examination. The FTC drew Facebook, with its behemoth social networking and messaging apps and a slew of recent privacy missteps, and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has been pushing into areas such as grocery and health.</p><p>As these companies build their legal teams and prepare strategies for the fight ahead, here are several lessons that Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook can learn from Microsoft's battle with the feds.</p><p>1. Don't deny the obvious</p><p>Or don't even put up a fight about whether you have a monopoly. Microsoft, whose Windows software accounted for about 90% of the market for PC operating systems, opted to argue that the space was actually competitive. Parts of the argument included videos in which Microsoft employees offered a straight-faced marketing pitch for the benefits of rival Linux programs with a tiny share of the market.</p><p>The impulse is understandable -- monopoly sounds like a dirty word. But U.S. antitrust law doesn't expressly forbid having a monopoly; it outlaws doing certain things to establish, maintain or extend one. That led some legal scholars to argue that Microsoft would have been better served by copping to the Windows monopoly and establishing a legal beachhead against the idea that it did anything illegal to gain it or keep it. Arguing against something so self-evident via the company's first witness strained credibility and started off the case on a bad footing.</p><p>It's easy to imagine a similar issue applying to Google, which has more than 84% of the web-search market and controls 82% of mobile-phone operating systems. In the app-store business, Google and iPhone maker Apple together control more than 95% of all U.S. mobile app spending by consumers, according to Sensor Tower data.</p><p>Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook this month told CBS that his company doesn't have a dominant position in any market. But regulators may look at the power it wields through its App Store. It could be more effective for these companies not to start by denying that leadership position -- if you have 80% or 90% of a market, arguing that you don't really dominate isn't the hill you want your legal reasoning to die on.</p><p>2. Don't resort to spin</p><p>Microsoft's credibility with the media was no higher, hurt by constant counterfactual statements and spin. Each day, after a bruising in court as government lawyer David Boies poked holes in executive testimony and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson alternated between chuckling at the witnesses and chastising them, Microsoft deployed a hapless PR person to the steps of the courthouse to recite the words, \"Today was another good day for Microsoft.\" It never was.</p><p>3. Assume all will be made public</p><p>Among the list of horrifying moments for Microsoft in court was the public showing of parts of the 20 hours of depositions of co-founder and CEO Bill Gates. The tapes (yes, they were tapes -- this was the '90s) showed an ill-lighted, evasive and combative Gates engaging in Clintonian word-wrangling, such as asking about the definition of the word \"definition\" and arguing what \"market share\" meant.</p><p>Microsoft claimed it had been assured the tapes would never be shown in court, or the company would have taken greater care with Gates' appearance and manner.</p><p>During their playback in court, the judge laughed at several points -- not the impression the software giant wanted to make on either Jackson or the public. Jackson told New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta that Gates came off as arrogant in the depositions.</p><p>Just as bad for Microsoft, an array of internal emails were read aloud in court that contradicted the testimony of its executives, which further angered Jackson. The takeaway? Assume everything will be aired in the court of public opinion. If it was true 20 years ago, it's even more apparent in the current era of oversharing, thanks to the tech companies' own services.</p><p>4. Don't be condescending</p><p>Most lawyers, judges and regulators don't appreciate being told or having it implied that they lack the ability to apprehend certain tech concepts. Or that the reason they think there's been an antitrust violation is because they just don't \"get\" the technology. It was true that Jackson and Boies seldom used a computer at the time. But it didn't require a computer science doctorate to divine the legal merits of the case.</p><p>At the height of Microsoft's hubris (or carelessness, or both), the company sent Windows chief Jim Allchin to the stand with a doctored video that purported to show how computing performance would be degraded when the browser was removed from Windows on a single PC. It was actually done on several computers and was an illustration of what might happen rather than a factual test, as the company initially claimed -- a fact that came to light only after several days of the government picking through every inconsistency in the video. Microsoft remade the simulation several times in an effort to save the testimony.</p><p>The company seemed to think it could get away with baldly stating a technological claim and mocking up something that backed it up, perhaps reasoning that no one would know the difference, but it miscalculated badly.</p><p>5. Choose your lawyers wisely</p><p>Microsoft took on the U.S. government led by a combative Gates and an equally aggressive general counsel, Bill Neukom. Gates, the son of an attorney, was outraged, frustrated and convinced the company was being unfairly targeted. One of the company's outside lawyers, from the firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said the company could put a ham sandwich into Windows if it wanted to. And throughout, Neukom not only failed to tamp down his executives' worst impulses, he seemed to amp them up. His legal style led observers to point out that his last name -- pronounced \"nuke 'em\" -- was quite fitting.</p><p>The U.S. government's latest antitrust targets should take heed: If your top executive's style tends toward waving a red flag in front of a bull, you may be wise to consider a top lawyer with a more conciliatory style. Google's top executives have already raised the ire of lawmakers for refusing to appear before Congress, and no one has ever accused CEO Jeff Bezos of being afraid of a fight.</p><p>At Facebook, where co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg regards Gates as a mentor and observers see similarities in their styles and temperaments, this lesson might be particularly important.</p><p>6. There are many ways to lose</p><p>Right now, the companies are at risk of only an inquiry -- the agencies are deciding what, if any, action to take. But even at this stage, they should keep in mind that a loss doesn't only mean a full-scale breakup or forced divestiture. Companies can avoid that extreme fate and still find, as Microsoft did, that the years of distraction from the fight have hampered their business and sucked up executive time and mental energy.</p><p>In an interview last year at the Code Conference, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith lamented the distraction the case caused, and cited it as a reason the company missed out on the search market -- the business that fueled the runaway success of Google, now under the microscope itself. Others have pinned Microsoft's abysmal performance in mobile computing partially on constraints and distractions from the case. Some of the company's business missteps can fairly be attributed to poor execution and strategic errors that had nothing to do with the government dispute.</p><p>Still, the notion that merely fighting an antitrust battle may do almost as much harm as losing one brings us to our last point.</p><p>7. Consider settling early</p><p>It's hard to say with certainty what the late 1990s and early 2000s might have looked like for Microsoft had it found a way to settle with the government earlier than 2002. Still, for the government's current targets, it's worth weighing a settlement against the effect of several years of investigation, a possible loss in court and potentially harsher restrictions or remedies.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google probably have a pretty good idea of what regulators may object to, and it's worthwhile for them to consider ways to assuage those concerns while keeping the core of their businesses and future ambitions intact.</p><p>The alternative is years of investigations, possibly damaging evidence and testimony, and ample distraction, all leading up to what could be a devastating loss in court.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: THE JUSTICE Department recently took antitrust oversight of Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission will scrutinize Amazon and Facebook.

Pinto also touched on the potential impact of investing in environmental, social and governance initiatives.</p><p>* At a time when banks around the world are resorting to major job cuts to save costs, Morgan Stanley is the latest firm to make a year-end efficiency push, cutting about 1,500 jobs, Bloomberg News reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The combined total is the highest number of job cuts by banks since 2015, the news outlet noted, citing filings by companies and labor unions.</p><p>* Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf's intense review and scrutiny of the bank's operations since he took over in October has led to uncertainty among employees over potential changes, the American Banker reports, citing people who asked not to be identified. The prospective changes include improving the firm's relations with regulators and shuffling executives, among others.</p><p>* The transition from London interbank offered rate, or Libor, to secured overnight financing rate, or Sofr, is expected to pick up pace in 2020 with the regulators increasingly getting more insistent on the switch ahead of the 2021 year-end deadline, the American Banker reports.</p><p>* The Financial Times reports on Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan's adoption of ways to continue trading in the $1.2 trillion U.S. repo market while reducing regulatory burdens. This could potentially ease a year-end cash crunch at the banks. Citing people familiar with the banks' strategy, the publication reported that Goldman has started using derivatives known as total return swaps that carry lower capital requirements than regular repo trades, while JPMorgan has encouraged use of so-called \"sponsored repo\" deals, in which a clearing house sits in between trades. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment to FT.</p><p>* Japan Post Holdings CEO Masatsugu Nagato and Senior Vice President Yasuo Suzuki resigned Dec. 27 to take management responsibility for selling improper life insurance products, The Wall Street Journal reported. The company also confirmed the departures of the heads of units Japan Post Insurance and Japan Post, Mitsuhiko Uehira and Kunio Yokoyama, respectively.</p><p>* Voce Capital Management is pushing to replace five key directors of insurer Argo Group International Holdings ahead of their planned retirement. The announcement, made by Voce in a Dec. 26 proxy statement, is the latest installment of a long-running battle between the activist investor and the insurer.</p><p>The Daily Dose: Express Edition is updated as of 6:30 a.m. ET.

Spain on Friday confirmed that a pregnant woman has been diagnosed with the Zika virus--the first such case in Europe. The health ministry said the woman had recently returned from Colombia, where it is believed she was infected. Zika, which is spreading through the Americas, has been linked to babies being born with underdeveloped brains. </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the microcephaly condition, linked to the mosquito-borne virus, a global public health emergency. The WHO on Thursday also advised countries not to accept blood donations from people who had travelled to Zika-affected regions, the Paris-based AFP news agency reported. The link between Zika infection and microcephaly has not been confirmed and the risks at different stages of pregnancy are unknown.\" In a statement, the Spanish health ministry said the pregnant woman was diagnosed as having Zika in the north-eastern Catalonia region. It did not release the woman's name, saying she was one of seven confirmed cases in Spain. It said two more patients were in Catalonia, two in Castile and Leon, one in Murcia and one in the capital Madrid. \"All are in good health,\" the ministry added. It also stressed that \"the diagnosed cases of Zika virus in Spain don't risk spreading the virus in our country as they are imported cases.\" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday updated its Zika virus guidance for pregnant women, advising them to protect themselves if their male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area where Zika virus is circulating. \"Until we know more, if your male sexual partner has traveled to or lives in an area with active Zika virus transmission, you should abstain from sex or use condoms the right way every time you have vaginal, anal, and oral sex for the duration of the pregnancy,\" the updated guidance says. The update in recommendations comes one day after Dallas County, TX, health officials, announced a case of the virus involving a patient who had sex with someone who had recently returned from Venezuela infected with the mosquito-borne virus. The CDC confirmed this as first known case of the virus being locally acquired in the continental United States in the current outbreak. The agency stressed that there was no risk to a developing fetus in this instance. The CDC on Friday revised its guidelines for pregnant women to include a recommendation that even those without symptoms of the Zika infection be tested after returning from affected areas.* * * <person><nameText>Martin Shkreli </nameText></person>Invokes the Fifth Amendment in House Appearance; Calls Lawmaker \"Imbeciles. \" Former drug executive <person><nameText>Martin Shkreli </nameText></person>smirked and brushed off questions about drug prices then tweeted that lawmakers were imbeciles on Thursday, when he appeared at a U.S. congressional hearing against his will. Shkreli, 32, sparked outrage last year among patients, medical societies and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton after his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals AG (Zug CHE), raised the price of the drug Daraprim by more than 5,000% to $750 a pill. The lifesaving medicine, used to treat a parasitic infection, once sold for $1 a pill and has been on the market for more than 60 years. At a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Shkreli repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says no person shall be compelled in any criminal case \"to be a witness against himself.\" He responded to questions by laughing, twirling a pencil and yawning. Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, asked Shkreli what he would tell a single, pregnant woman with AIDS who needed Daraprim to survive, and whether he thought he had done anything wrong. Shkreli declined to answer. \"I intend to follow the advice of my counsel, not yours,\" said Shkreli after South Carolina Republican Representative Trey Gowdy suggested he could answer questions that were unrelated to pending fraud charges against him. After the hearing, Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, attributed his client's behavior to \"nervous energy.\" Later, though, Shkreli wrote on Twitter: \"Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government.\" U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, who learned about the tweet while Turing Chief Commercial Officer Nancy Retzlaff was testifying, pounded his fist on the dais. The Maryland Democrat then shouted about an internal Turing document in which a staffer joked about the price increase. \"You all spent all of your time strategizing about how to hide your price increase and coming up with stupid jokes while other people were sitting there trying to figure out how they were going to survive,\" Cummings said. Shkreli was arrested in December and charged with running his investment funds and companies almost like a Ponzi scheme. He has pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges, which are not related to the pricing of Daraprim. He also stepped down from Turing and was fired from KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc. (South San Francisco). Cummings pleaded with Shkreli to reconsider his views about drug pricing: \"You can go down as the poster boy for greedy drug company executives, or you can change the system.\" Also at the hearing, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Laval Quebec) interim CEO Howard Schiller put forward a conciliatory face, testifying that his company had changed its business and pricing tactics. \"Where we have made mistakes, we are listening and changing,\" Schiller said during opening remarks. \"In a number of cases, we have been too aggressive\" about price increases.* * * Pfizer Earnings Fall but Still Top Street's 4Q Forecasts. U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (New York City) reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, powered by strong sales of several of the company's key drugs. However, the company also issued a lower-than-expected financial forecast for 2016, based in part on adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Pfizer shares closed the week down 5% at $29.02. Pfizer reported fourth-quarter net income of $613 million, or 10 cents a share, compared to net income of $1.23 billion, or 19 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time charges, the drugmaker reported earnings per share of 53 cents, 1 cent higher than the consensus forecast of financial analysts surveyed by S...apital IQ. Revenue for the three-month period ending in December was $14 billion, up 7% from 2014 and above the nearly $13.6 consensus forecast of the Wall Street analysts. Operational revenue growth was driven by the inclusion of $1.1 billion in revenue from the legacy operations of Hospira, the rival pharmaceutical firm Pfizer acquired during 2015. The company also reported strong financial performance of several key drugs, including Prevnar 13, a vaccine used to prevent pneumonia, and Ibrance, a prescription medication for post-menopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. The foregoing sales help mitigate Pfizer's loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for drugs like Celebrex, a medication used to treat arthritis. The company said standalone revenue increased 3% during 2015, marking Pfizer's first year of operational growth since the company lost exclusivity rights to several drugs. Pfizer projected mid-to-high-single-digit operational growth in 2016, offset by anticipated negative impact of $2.3 billion due to generic competition for the company's medications. Adverse foreign exchange rates, particularly in relation to Venezuela, also are expected to temper 2016 revenues, the company said. In all, Pfizer forecast 2016 revenues of $49 billion to $51 billion, and earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.30. The projections fell below the $53.2 billion in revenue and $2.35 in earnings per share predicted in the S...apital IQ analyst survey. Predicting the company's key product sales would remain strong this year, Chairman and CEO Ian Read said Pfizer remains on track to complete its record $160 billion merger with Ireland-based rival Allergan during the second half of 2016. The pending deal, the largest in healthcare industry history, has been criticized because it is rooted in a tax-saving strategy in which Allergan's parent firm would become the parent of the combined new business.* * * Medical Stock Spotlight: Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq) led advancing issues, soaring $1.55, or 91% for the week, to $3.25 after equities researchers at Rodman ...nshaw initiated coverage on shares with a \"buy\" rating and issued a $10 price target. The brokerage's price target would suggest a potential upside of over 300% from the stock's current price. However, some investors are questioning whether a jump that huge is warranted and perhaps now is the perfect time to short shares. Waltham, MA-based Eyegate Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical firm focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. The company has a market cap of $20.13 million. EGP-437 is the first and only product in clinical trials and incorporates a reformulated topically active corticosteroid, dexamethasone phosphate, which is delivered into the ocular tissues though the company's proprietary drug delivery system--the EyeGate II Delivery System. Elsewhere, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (Nasdaq) rocketed $2.03, or 40%, to $7.05 after the company announced it received a non-binding proposal letter from a consortium of investors to acquire the company for $7.00 per share. A spokesman for one of the investors, Heng Ren Investments, said that Sinovac is a \"coveted stock\" because its EV-71 vaccine has a \"massive\" target market in China. He pointed out that the 1- to 5-year-old population in China is approximately 80 million and there are 17 million newborns per year. In addition, the company can expand its market to Southeast Asia where hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is endemic and can be fatal for children. The spokesman continued, \"The initial production is eventually 20 million doses. There are estimates by vaccine experts EV-71 pricing could be $10.00-$25.00 per dose, and in high-risk situations $50.00-$75.00.\" Sinovac was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Beijing. And Hansen Medical Inc. (Nasdaq) surged 36% to $2.93 after the company announced it received the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval for the Magellan Robotic Catheter eKit (MRC eKit). The eKit is its latest addition to a family of approved MRCs and this will help improve robotic capabilities and control in peripheral vasculature procedures according to some observers. This new kit will help physicians take robotic control of third party microcatheters via the current MRC 6Fr architecture, the company claims. The main goal of the kit is to help reduce radiation exposure time and overall procedure time. Mountain View, CA-based Hansen Medical describes itself as \"a global leader in intravascular robotics, born from the vision of creating a new generation of advanced medical robotics that would empower and protect physicians while providing enhanced care for patients.\" But Carbylan Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq) plunged 75% to $1.83 after being downgraded by equities research analysts at Leerink Swann from an \"outperform\" rating to a \"market perform\" rating in a research report issued to clients last week. They presently have a $1.80 price objective on the specialty pharmaceutical company's stock--down from their previous price objective of $15.00. In related news, CEO David Renzi sold 10,000 shares of Carbylan stock in a transaction dated Wednesday, December 30th. The stock was sold at an average price of $3.70, for a total transaction of $37,000.00. Palo Alto, CA-based Carbylan Therapeutics is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of Hydros-TA, an intra-articular (IA), injectable product candidate to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. And Axovant Sciences Ltd. (NYSE) skidded $4.70, or 30%, to $11.23 after Pfizer Inc. reportedly halted a phase II study related to one of the company's Alzheimer's drugs known as PF-05212377. \"The study was terminated October 23, 2015 as pre-specified, interim analysis futility criteria were met. The termination was not due to safety concerns,\" said Pfizer's website. Hamilton, Bermuda-based Axovant has its own Alzheimer's study for RVT-101 in Phase 3 trials, which utilizes the same mechanism as that of Pfizer's drug. The thinking among investors is that if Pfizer's drug isn't successful in trials, there is a good chance that Axovant's drug may also have issues meeting its goals.* * * Abbott to Buy Medical Test Provider Alere. Abbott Laboratories Inc. (Abbott Park IL) agreed to buy Alere Inc. (WalthamMA) for $56 a share, or about $5.8 billion, to become the leader in the market for rapid medical tests and adding another deal to a long list in the fast-consolidating medical devices and technology space. The acquisition will boost Abbott's diagnostics sales to about $7 billion, CEO Miles White told investors, and add tests for heart attacks, influenza and drug abuse to Abbott's suite of products for testing genetic mutations that can assess patients' reactions to pharmaceuticals or can help guide cancer therapy. \"The demand for point-of-care testing is accelerating as healthcare providers and consumers look for better ways to get fast, accurate and actionable information to guide decision making that improves patient care and reduces unnecessary healthcare\" spending, White said. The medical device sector has been consolidating in the face of pressure from hospitals and health systems to cut costs. Last year, there were 1,007 pending or completed deals in the industry, worth a total of $58.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two more deals were announced, as Stryker Corp. (Kalamazoo MI), a market leader in artificial hips and knees, agreed to buy Sage Products LLC (Cary IL) for $2.78 billion in cash from its private equity owner Madison Dearborn Partners LLC (Chicago). Medtronic Plc (Dublin IRL), the largest manufacturer of heart rhythm devices like pacemakers, agreed to acquire Bellco Srl (Mirandola ITA), a privately-held company that sells equipment for kidney dialysis. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Abbott's purchase of Alere will add 12 to 13 cents to Abbott's earnings per share in 2017 and will yield cost savings of $500 million by 2019, the companies said in a statement. Abbott will also take on $2.6 billion of debt from Alere, which posted sales of $2.59 billion in 2014. White said that the Alere deal won't restrict his interest in acquisitions in other areas. Alere shares closed the week up 43% at $53.20 in New York. Abbott fell 1% to $37.40.* * * Tracking Washington: About 12.7 million Americans signed up for 2016 health insurance coverage through the government insurance exchanges, surpassing its expectations, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Thursday. The government began offering subsidies for individual insurance in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act and charges a penalty to Americans who do not have health insurance. In 37 states, customers can buy these plans on HealthCare.gov, the federally run website, while the other states and Washington D.C. run their own online exchanges. Enrollment closed on Jan. 31 for 2016. Avalere Health LLC, a Washington, DC-based health consulting firm, said that based on these numbers, it expects 2016 year-end enrollment will be about 10.2 million, above the Obama administration's forecast of 10 million people being covered through the exchanges. Insurers have been struggling to make money on the exchanges, where low enrollment has contributed to high per-customer overhead and has made it a riskier business for them. Medical costs have also been an issue for insurers in 2015, with many reporting that they have booked unsustainable losses on these products. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (Minnetonka MN) in November said that it may exit the exchanges after 2016. On HealthCare.gov, about 4 million new customers signed up for plans and another 5.6 million consumers returned to buy insurance again, Burwell told reporters. In all, about 2.7 million people aged 18 to 34 signed up for the insurance, she said. Customers who are younger tend to have fewer medical costs and are considered an important factor in creating financial stability for the private health insurers like UnitedHealth, Aetna Inc. (Hartford CT) and Anthem Inc. (Indianapolis IN) that sell these plans. Andy Slavitt, who runs the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services division of the health department, said that the enrollment numbers had surpassed the mid-point of its projection to have between 11 million and 14.1 million people signed up for 2016 health coverage at this point in the year. MondayMorning/February 8, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 5 CORPORATE Aetna Tops 4Q Expectations, But 2016 Outlook Falls Short. Aetna Inc. (Hartford CT), the U.S.'s third-biggest health insurer by enrollment, posted operating profit that beat analysts' expectations after the company spent less on medical care than a year ago. In the fourth quarter, net income rose 38% to $321 million, or 91 cents a share, from $232 million, or 65 cents a share, a year before, the company said in a statement. Operating earnings were $1.37 a share, compared with the $1.21 average of analysts' estimates. One of Aetna's biggest lines of business is Medicare, where it runs private-sector plans to care for the elderly. The insurer is expanding its bet on the program with an agreement to buy Humana Inc. (Louisville KY) for about $37 billion in cash and stock, a deal which could close this year. Humana, with about 3.2 million Medicare Advantage clients, is No. 2 in that line of business behind UnitedHealth Group Inc. (Minnetonka MN) Aetna said it had 1.25 million people in the program at the end of last year. For the fourth quarter, Aetna said that its costs to care for patients dropped in both its commercial and government businesses, which includes Medicare Advantage as well as privately run Medicaid plans. It spent 81.9 cents of every premium dollar on care, compared with 83 cents the previous year, leaving more money for profits. Aetna also forecast 2016 results, which don't include the acquisition of Humana. Medical costs may rise slightly, to 81.6 cents of every premium dollar in 2016, from 80.8 cents for all of 2015. Operating margins may narrow, to at least 8% from 8.3% last year. Operating earnings will be at least $7.75 a share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.03 a share. Membership will decline to 22.7 million to 22.8 million people at the end of the first quarter, from 23.5 million people at the end of 2015. Aetna closed the week down 3% at $99.22.* * * GlaxoSmithKline Posts Loss as It Integrates New Businesses. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (London) posted a loss of 428 million pounds ($616 million) for the fourth quarter of 2015--compared with a profit of over 1 billion pounds for the same period a year earlier--as the company moved to integrate new businesses. However, Glaxo's revenue and profit were in-line with analyst expectations and reinforced guidance that earnings would grow strongly in 2016, sending its shares higher. Glaxo said revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 climbed to 6.3 billion pounds ($9.1 billion), thanks to a strong performance from its vaccine and consumer healthcare divisions. Core operating profit fell 23% to 1.4 billion pounds, largely due to Glaxo's shift to a higher-volume, lower-margin business following its $20 billion three-part transaction with Novartis AG (Basel CHE). The Novartis deal, which closed in the first quarter of 2015, involved Glaxo trading its high-margin cancer drugs for the Swiss company's lower-margin vaccines business and the pair pooling their consumer healthcare arms into a joint venture controlled by the company. Glaxo's pharmaceuticals division has come under heavy pressure in the U.S., where increasingly powerful insurers have forced the company to cut the price of its blockbuster inhaler Advair to win a favored place on their formularies. CEO Andrew Witty is placing a long-term bet that the expanded vaccines and consumer healthcare businesses will provide a buffer for the riskier pharmaceuticals business, which he has said is exposed to political shifts on issues such as drug pricing. Restructuring costs from the transaction meant that Glaxo swung to a net loss of 354 million pounds in the fourth quarter, compared with a 1 billion-pound profit a year earlier, while revenue climbed from 6.2 billion pounds to 6.3 billion. Glaxo expects earnings to return to growth in 2016, when the year-earlier comparisons will no longer include the company's old cancer-medicines business. It reiterated guidance that core earnings per share will grow by a double-digit percentage this coming year, while confirming it will pay investors an ordinary dividend of 80 pence and a special dividend of 20 pence. One bright spot for the pharmaceuticals business was Glaxo's majority-owned HIV business, ViiV Healthcare. Sales of HIV drugs increased 51% to 695 million pounds in the fourth-quarter, mainly due to the growth of two recently-launched drugs, Triumeq and Tivicay. Company shares closed the week down 3% at 1,401 pence in London.* * * Merck Gives Cautious 2016 View as Sales of Top Meds Fall Short. Merck .... (Kenilworth NJ) posted an 87% drop in fourth-quarter profit compared with last year, when the drugmaker had a huge gain from the sale of its consumer health business. It beat Wall Street profit forecasts, but came up short on revenue. The strong dollar and increasing pricing pressure and competition for some of its older medicines cut sales of some of Merck's top sellers. That was partly offset by climbing sales of Merck's newest medicines and its top vaccines. Revenue, however, dipped 3%. The company is rebuilding its decimated hepatitis C business and building up its cancer and hospital-drug franchises as it transitions to a new product cycle after its latest restructuring program. That cut more than $2.5 billion in annual spending. Amid growing public and political anger over soaring prices, drugmakers are under pressure to limit price hikes or even lower prices for existing drugs, ending a decade as safe, steady investments. \"This is not business as usual, not in the U.S. and not globally,\" said analyst Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities, adding, \"Merck gets it.\" A number of drugmakers now are trying to boost profits through big acquisitions or tax inversions, in which they buy a foreign drugmaker to relocate their corporate address to a lower-tax country, but not their actual headquarters. Merck is focusing on future cancer treatments and on drugs that can cure infectious diseases at a maintainable cost, Brozak said. The maker of diabetes pill Januvia and groundbreaking cancer drug Keytruda said net income was $976 million, or 35 cents per share. A year earlier, net income was $7.32 billion, or $2.54 per share, boosted by a gain from selling Merck's consumer business to Bayer AG (Leverkusen DEU) for $11.2 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, fourth-quarter income was $2.61 billion, or 93 cents per share, a penny better than analysts expected. Revenue totaled $10.2 billion, below the $10.45 billion analysts expected. Merck said the strong dollar reduced revenue by 7%. Sales of Merck's top franchise, Januvia and Janumet for Type 2 diabetes, fell 12% to $1.45 billion. Sales hit $322 million for Merck's new antibiotic, Cubicin, and quadrupled to $214 million for Keytruda, a new drug that fights advanced skin and lung cancer by boosting the immune system. Merck is testing it against many tumor types and sees cancer as a key growth area. CEO Kenneth C. Frazier told analysts that Merck's acquisition strategy is now focused on finding experimental drugs in early stages of testing, where it can apply its expertise to improve them. Shares closed the week down 2% at $49.38.GILEAD SCIENCES INC. (Foster City CA) expects U.S. use of its blockbuster hepatitis C treatment to be flat or stable this year as the franchise faces new competition from other drugmakers. The biotechnology firm is on the lookout for acquisition opportunities to sustain growth, executives said. Fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts' estimates after the company's hepatitis C pills, Sovaldi and Harvoni, sold $4.89 billion, Gilead said in a statement. While the drugs have been among the fastest-selling medications of all time, they face competition from AbbVie Inc. (North Chicago) and a therapy from Merck .... (Kenilworth NJ) that was approved last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The flow of new hepatitis C patients will be \"fairly flat, stable\" in the U.S., said Paul Carter, the company's executive vice president of commercial operations. European use should continue to grow, he said. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $4.68 billion, or $3.18 a share, from $3.49 billion, or $2.18, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $3.32 a share, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.99. John Milligan, who will become CEO in March, said the company is \"very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships or potentially acquisitions that can help us grow\" in treatment areas outside of viral diseases. He named oncology, inflammatory diseases and liver diseases as areas of interest. While Milligan, who currently serves as COO, keeps a mental shopping list, he said \"whether or not those things ever come to fruition depends on a lot of factors,\" including price. Product sales this year will be $30 billion to $31 billion, Gilead said. Analysts have estimated revenue of $31.5 billion, though those estimates may not be comparable because some analysts include revenue from royalties and other sources, while Gilead only projects drug sales. The company also said it will add $12 billion to its share buyback program, after a current $15 billion buyback announced last year is completed. The shares closed the week down 3% at $85.14.BAYER AG (Leverkusen DEU) on Friday disclosed that Europe's drug regulator said the defective blood clotting test device used in a key trial for the approval of the company's top-selling anti-clotting drug Xarelto did not distort the study's main findings. \"Xarelto can continue to be used as before, in line with the current prescribing information,\" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on its website. The study known as \"ROCKET\" compared Xarelto with older drug warfarin for preventing strokes in patients with a type of irregular heartbeat common among the elderly. That is by far the biggest market for the drug, which Bayer jointly developed with Johnson ...hnson (New Brunswick NJ), and which competes with Bristol Myers-Squibb Co. (New York) and Pfizer Inc.'s (New York) Eliquis. A so-called INR device by Alere Inc. (WalthamMA), which measures how quickly blood starts clotting and which was used in the trial, was recalled in December 2014 after giving falsely low test results. \"A defect with the international normalized ratio (INR) device used in the ROCKET study does not change its conclusions on the overall safety or benefit-risk balance of Xarelto,\" EMA said in the statement. Bayer said at the end of October that Xarelto has a 34% market share globally. Bayer chalked up 1.68 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in revenue from Xarelto in 2014 and 1.60 billion in the first nine months of 2015, up 38% from a year earlier, making it Bayer's best-selling drug. Company shares closed the week down 7% at 96.01 euros in Frankfurt.SANOFI SA (Paris) told its labor unions that it plans to cut 600 jobs in its home country over three years, as France's biggest company by market value seeks to trim costs. The departures will be voluntary, and mostly through early retirement, according to a statement from Sanofi. The drugmaker, which employs a quarter of its staff, or 27,000 people, in France, said the cuts won't have any impact on research and development operations. The proposed reductions also don't apply to the Merial animal-health unit, which is being given to Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Ingelheim DEU) in exchange for consumer-health operations. A total of 296 research and development positions that were to be filled in France will be eliminated, Thierry Bodin, a Sanofi union representative, said following meetings with executives from Sanofi. That's in addition to the 600 planned reductions. Of the 600 job cuts, more than 100 are corporate jobs, affecting central and support functions, and 155 positions are in the company's commercial operations division, Bodin said. CEO Olivier Brandicourt, who took over in April, is slimming down a company that is the product of dozens of acquisitions. Sanofi's diabetes business, its largest, is facing pricing pressures in the U.S. and generic competition to its best-seller, the Lantus insulin. The CEO pledged in November to slash costs by 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to help sustain earnings growth through 2020. The drugmaker also is reviewing options for its European generic business. Sanofi has more than 110,000 employees in 100 countries, according to its website. Job cuts also will take place outside France, the company has said. Sanofi is likely to provide more details on the planned cuts on Feb. 9, when it presents 2015 earnings. Shares closed the week down 4% at 71.70 euros in Paris.INDEX VENTURES (Geneva CHE), best known for funding startups like Skype and the creator of the Candy Crush Saga online game, is spinning off its biotechnology investments into a new venture-capital firm. Medicxi Ventures will be one of the largest firms of its kind in Europe with $750 million under management, including a new 210 million-euro ($230 million) fund formed with London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Johnson ...hnson (New Brunswick NNJ). The two pharmaceutical giants will each put in 25% of the total amount, and Medicxi will make the final investment decisions, the firm said in a statement. The separation highlights the success of Index's approach to the biotechnology industry: investing in early-stage companies focused on one product. That has cut in half the time needed to reach a return on the investment, as it quickly becomes apparent whether the product will succeed or fail. \"This is the moment to double down and invest in early-stage life sciences,\" said Francesco De Rubertis, one of four general partners managing the new firm. He joined Index in 1997 to start investments in healthcare and biotechnology companies. As many as 40% of the medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are discovered in Europe but commercialized by U.S. companies, De Rubertis said. He and his partners--Index veterans Michele Ollier, Kevin Johnson and David Grainger--want to give researchers from Cambridge, England, to Geneva the opportunity to develop their ideas close to their own labs. \"We can create the companies in Europe,\" De Rubertis said. \"Europe is a place that can be sustainable for investors.\" About 80% of the new fund will be invested in European companies, with the remaining 20% available for opportunities outside the region, he said. \"Going into a second fund with the same team at Medicxi is testament to the fact that it is and continues to be a successful collaboration,\" said Richard Mason, head of J...nnovation in London. \"We really see Europe as an absolute hotbed of biomedical innovation.\"FDA/EMA ROUNDUP: U. S. Food and Drug Administration staff members on Friday said Celltrion Inc.'s (Incheon, South Korea) biosimilar form of Johnson ...hnson's Remicade arthritis drug appeared \"highly similar\" to the widely used branded product. The news sent shares of J...whose annual Remicade (infliximab) sales of $6.5 billion are mostly in the United States, down 4% for the week to $100.50. It also hit AbbVie Inc. and Amgen Inc., which make arthritis treatments that work in the same way. Pfizer Inc. has teamed up with Celltrion in marketing the Remsima biosimilar. FDA scientists released their favorable report ahead of a scheduled meeting tomorrow of an independent medical advisory panel to the agency. The panel will decide whether to recommend approval of Remsima to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease. Celltrion and Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, want to sell Remsima in the U.S. as a cut-price copy of Remicade. Elsewhere, Denmark's Lundbeck A/S (Valby) said on Thursday an FDA committee had recommended that its anti-depression drug Brintellix can add improved cognitive functions to its information leaflet, a first of its kind. Though not bound to follow the committee's recommendation, the FDA is likely to follow it, analysts said. \"Lundbeck will be the only product on the market with a leaflet on cognitive effects. FDA is increasing its focus on this area, which means doctors also will,\" Danish brokerage Alm. Brand wrote in a note to clients. Brintellix, developed with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., was approved to treat adult depression by U.S. regulators in 2013, and has since been approved in 64 countries. Chief Executive Kaare Schultz said last year he expected Brintellix to become a blockbuster drug that would help the company swing to a profit in 2016. The FDA has denied the expanded use of Vertex Pharmaceutical Inc.'s (San DiegoCA) bestseller, Kalydeco, in certain cystic fibrosis patients, the company said on Friday. The regulator rejected the company's application for using the drug in cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 or older, who have one of 23 residual function mutations. Vertex's shares closed the week down 5% at $86.61. Analysts, however, said the news reflected a minor setback for Vertex, considering the company is recruiting the same patient population into one of its late-stage trials. These trials should have results by mid-2017, which would suggest that the population could be included in the labeled indication 18-24 months from now if not immediately, Leerink Partners analysts said. Kalydeco, which brought in revenue of $632 million in 2015, is already approved to treat CF patients aged 2 and older with 10 different mutations in the CFTR gene. The FDA has revised the instructions for labeling Medtronic Plc's (Dublin IRL) CoreValve System to include patients with end-stage renal disease and low flow, low gradient aortic stenosis, the company has announced. Previously, physicians were advised not to treat this patient population with transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to severe comorbidities. The decision was based on positive CoreValve data on stroke rates and survival in these patients at one year. The FDA has granted approval to Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (Aliso Viejo CA) Onzetra Xsail for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. A combination product, Onzetra Xsail delivers sumatriptan powder through the Xsail breath-powered delivery device. Sumatriptan previously has been approved by the FDA in tablet and injectable forms. The FDA approved Eisai Co. Ltd.'s (Tokyo) Halaven chemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma. Halaven is the first drug approved to treat liposarcoma that has shown improvement in survival time, according to Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in CDER (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research). A 143-patient trial of the drug demonstrated a median overall survival of 15.6 months compared with 8.4 months for those who received dacarbazine. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (New York City) scored a win in Europe with Daklinza, with regulators approving expanded use of the hepatitis C drug in three new patient populations. As a result of the decision, Daklinza can be used in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc.'s Sovaldi in patients with chronic HCV who also have decompensated cirrhosis, HIV-1 co-infection or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV. Separately, the company reported that it had stopped a Phase 3 study of Opdivo in head and neck cancer early because it met the primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in patients on the study drug. Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to be approved globally. The CheckMate -141 trial evaluated Opdivo in patients with recurrent or metastatic platinum-refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck against standard of care therapy. The FDA has approved Merck ....'s (Kenilworth NJ) Zepatier, a combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 and 4. An oral treatment, Zepatier was evaluated in 1,373 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 or 4 infections with and without cirrhosis for 12 or 16 weeks. Zepatier was granted \"breakthrough therapy\" designation for the HCV genotype 1 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease and for chronic HCV genotype 4 infection. And the U.K.'s reimbursement watchdog has given its blessing to five treatments--four for cancer and one for a lung disease--recommending they be funded by the National Health Service, while rejecting Eli Lilly ....'s (Indianapolis IN) stomach-cancer drug. Most notably, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reversed its preliminary decision not to reimburse Novartis AG's (Basel CHE) multiple myeloma treatment Farydak. The agency changed course after Novartis submitted a revised economic analysis, and NICE recommended reimbursing the drug as long as it is provided with the agreed-upon discount in the patient access scheme. NICE turned down Lilly's stomach-cancer drug Cyramza, contending that its benefit doesn't justify its high cost, and that it also did not qualify for end-of-life consideration. MondayMorning/February 8, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 5 Weekly Stock Performance (as of February 5, 2016)MondayMorning/February 8, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 5WALL ST./FINANCE Markets: The willingness of U.S. stock investors to abide price-earnings ratios stretching into three and four digits came under pressure Friday as the Nasdaq Composite Index fell to its lowest level since October 2014. The tumble in American equities turned into a full-blown selloff in stocks with the highest valuations. The Nasdaq Internet Index sank 5.2%, as Facebook Inc. lost 5.8%. The Nasdaq 100 Index lost 3.4% to 4,024.47--the lowest since August. The Standard ...or's 500 Index fell 1.9% to 1,880.05, capping the second-worst week this year, down 3.1%. It was the gauge's worst performance on the day of a U.S. jobs report since June 2012, when it plunged 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 211.75 points, or 1.3%, to 16,204.97. Stocks declined in inverse proportion to valuation, with a group of about 100 companies with the highest price-earnings ratios in the Russell 1000 Index declining more than 4.5% while the lowest gained 1.9%. \"Investors are selling the big tech and large-cap names to stem any further losses--that's what's leading us down today,\" said Stephen Carl, principal and head equity trader at Williams Capital Group LP (New York). \"Economic numbers were mixed, and the market started off modestly down before moving to make new lows as it went along. You've seen profit-taking going into the weekend as well.\" A report Friday showed job growth settled into a more sustainable pace in January and the unemployment rate dropped to an almost eight-year low of 4.9%, signs of a resilient labor market that's causing wage growth to stir. While the increase in payrolls was less than forecast, it largely reflected payback for a seasonal hiring pickup in the final two months of 2015. Hourly earnings rose more than estimated after climbing in the year to December by the most since July 2009. The S...00 Technology Index fell 3.4%, its third decline in four days. Salesforce.com dropped 13%, while Adobe Systems Inc. and Red Hat Inc. lost at least 7.9%. LinkedIn reported a loss for the year ended Dec. 31. The company said income before items was $373 million for the 12 months, meaning its market value at Thursday's close was almost 70 times earnings by that measure. Shares in Alphabet failed to sustain gains sparked by better-than-expected earnings and dropped 7.6% for the week, while the iPhone maker limited losses to 3.4% in the five days. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index climbed 7.1% Friday to 23.38. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX rose 11% in January, its third straight monthly increase. For the week, the S...kidded 60.19, or 3.10%, to 1,880.05. The Dow fell 261.33, or 1.59%, to 16,204.97. The Nasdaq plummeted 250.80, or 5.44%, to 4,363.15.* * *  IPO Sector: The biotech sector could power the IPO market through the rest of the first quarter according to some observers. Of the 17 new IPO filings in January, there were 13 healthcare companies, including 11 biotechs. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 23% this year. A numbing 81% of 2015 biotech IPOs now trade below their issue price. Against that backdrop, large biotechs Editas Medicine Inc. and BeiGene Co. Ltd. delivered solid first returns as the first two IPOs of 2016. Both companies plan to use proceeds from their initial offerings to fund clinical trials. There were 84 biotech companies that went public in the United States in 2014, the largest number on record, while last year 50 such companies floated IPOs, according to Dealogic. Editas Medicine (Cambridge MA), which is producing a technology that corrects disease-causing genes, gained in its market debut. Its shares closed the week up 10% at $17.60. The company raised $94.4 million, pricing shares at the low end of the range it had marketed to investors. Editas makes a gene-editing technology that is aimed at treating diseases for which the genetic causes are well understood. The company's most advanced product would be used to treat a progressive form of blindness. Editas is also conducting research on preventing cancer, and it is teaming up with an immunotherapy company, Juno Therapeutics Inc., to do so. Editas Medicine plans lists on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"EDIT.\" Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan acted as lead managers on the deal. Chinese immunotherapy biotech BeiGene (Beijing) priced an upsized IPO of 6.6 million shares at $24--the high end of the range ($158 million)--and closed the week up 41% at $33.91. It was the first biotech IPO to price above the midpoint since September's REGENXBIO. However, the deal was supported by its largest shareholders, who committed to buying up 50% of the offering. BeiGene lists on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"BGNE.\" Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Cowen ...mpany acted as lead managers on the deal.

The British experiment would not contravene the moratorium because there is no intention to implant the altered embryos in a womb. But it brings one step closer the fateful decision of whether to alter the human germ line for medical or other purposes. The new genetic editing technique, known as Crispr or Crispr-Cas9, lets researchers perform cut-and-paste operations on DNA, the hereditary material, with unprecedented ease and precision. Unlike most types of gene therapy, a longstanding approach that aims to alter only adult human tissues that die with the patient, the Crispr technique could be used to change human eggs, sperm and early embryos, and such alterations would be inherited by the patient's children. Because changing the human germ line is perceived to hold far-reaching consequences, the leading scientific academies of the United States, Britain and China issued a joint statement in December asking researchers around the world to hold off on altering human inheritance. A British regulatory agency that oversees reproductive biology--the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority--approved an application by Kathy Niakan, of the Francis Crick Institute in London, to alter human embryos with the Crispr technique. Dr. Niakan, a developmental biologist, has no intention of implanting the altered embryos in a womb. According to a report in Nature, she will let the embryos expire when they are seven days old and have reached the blastocyst, or implantation, stage. The usual source of such embryos is fertility clinics that have generated more than their clients need. Dr. Niakan's goal is to understand the cascade of genetic switches that are thrown as the fertilized egg progresses through its first few divisions. Her experiment will lead to no specific medical treatment, only to better knowledge of the basic biology of development. This may prove useful in treating certain cases of infertility, given that many fertilized eggs fail before they reach the blastocyst stage. The cascade of switches, beginning with the activation of a gene known as Oct4, has been well worked out in mice, but researchers would like to know how similar the process is in humans. Practical treatments developed from this knowledge would not necessarily require Crispr. British researchers may now be able to seize the lead in exploring the early stages of human embryology. In the United States, Congress has forbidden the government to support research in which a human embryo is destroyed, although the ban does not apply to privately funded researchers.Taking a daily low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk for heart attack and stroke, and possibly the risk for certain cancers. Now researchers have found another possible benefit: protection against dying from a Staphylococcus aureus blood infection. Swiss scientists followed 838 cases of S. aureus infection from 2001 through 2013. From the group, they selected 157 who were taking aspirin and matched them with 157 controls, similar in age, severity of infection, treatments undergone and various other health and behavioral characteristics, but who were not taking low-dose aspirin. The study is in Critical Care Medicine. At the end of 30 days, 27.4% of the controls had died, but only 12.1% of those on aspirin had died. After controlling for other factors, taking low-dose aspirin was associated with a 42% lower risk of death. The authors did a similar analysis with 134 aspirin users with E. coli infection and 134 controls, but found no effect of aspirin on infection with that germ. \"This is a retrospective study that finds an association, not causality,\" said the lead author, Dr. Michael Osthoff, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Basel. \"There may still be factors we haven't controlled for. It's too early to tell everyone with S. aureus infection to take aspirin. There are downsides to taking aspirin, too.\"An experimental \"artificial pancreas\" that pairs with a smartphone to monitor blood sugar and automatically deliver insulin may work better for teens with type 1 diabetes than using separate products already on the market, a small study suggests. Researchers tested the artificial pancreas, formally known as a closed-loop insulin delivery system, in a group of 12 young diabetics around the clock for a week and then compared how well it worked relative to another week when they used separate devices to monitor glucose and pump insulin. With the artificial pancreas, the teens had significantly lower average blood sugar levels of 8.7 mmol/liter (about 157 mg/deciliter), compared to 10.1 mmol/L (182 mg/dl) with the separate devices. In the U.S., diabetes is diagnosed when fasting blood sugar is 126 mg/dl or higher. For this experiment, the safe target range was 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dl) to 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dl). The teens' glucose was within that safe target range 72% of the time when using the artificial pancreas versus 53% of the time with the separate devices. Time spent with dangerously low blood sugar was minimal and about equal with both systems, the researchers found. \"The present study adds knowledge about performance in teenagers who are particularly vulnerable to poor glucose control,\" said lead author Dr. Roman Hovorka, director of research at the University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories in the U.K. \"Home testing in very young children and elderly will follow,\" Hovorka added. \"The application of the artificial pancreas is not limited by age but by the ability to use the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor.\" Poorly controlled, type 1 diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney complications and death. People typically have to test their own blood sugar levels throughout the day and inject insulin to manage it. Nights are often a problem because dangerous blood sugar changes can happen while the person is sleeping, and automatic blood sugar monitoring and delivery of insulin is one solution. Beyond the better disease control found with the artificial pancreas, the experiment also turned up no serious side effects with this approach. Importantly, the occurrence of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, was rarer than seen in previous experiments, the authors note in the journal Diabetes Care. The experiment is small and brief, and more studies involving more people over much longer periods of time will be needed before an artificial pancreas can be approved for widespread use, the authors caution. Still, this is the first trial investigating round-the-clock home use of the artificial pancreas in teens with type 1 diabetes, and the findings suggest that patients this age may be capable of using the option, the authors note.Increasing physical activity to burn more calories works up to a point, but then the body adjusts to keep energy use stable, according to a new study. As a result, people who are extremely active burn a similar number of calories as only moderately active people, researchers say. And for people trying to modify their weight, increasing exercise will not translate to endless increases in calories expended. In a previous study, lead author Herman Pontzer of Hunter College at the City University of New York found that people in subsistence farming or hunter-gatherer societies, who are moving around and walking great distances for much of the day, have similar daily calorie burn to people in developed countries who are more sedentary. \"When I first got into this area with hunter gatherers in Tanzania, we measured daily energy expenditures and they were very physically active every day,\" but weren't burning more calories than adults in the U.S. or Europe, Pontzer said. For the new study, Pontzer and colleagues studied energy expenditure in 332 adults, aged 25 to 45 years. They measured total energy expenditure using specially \"labeled\" water, and measuring how the water molecules are eliminated over time in saliva, urine or blood samples. The researchers also tested exhaled carbon dioxide to measure resting metabolic rate and had the subjects wear accelerometers to record daily activity levels. The researchers found that for less active people, energy expenditure increased alongside increases in physical activity. But at higher levels of activity, calorie burn plateaued. Resting metabolic rate tended to be constant at 1,540 calories per day, and activity increased calorie burn up to 2,600 calories per day, at which point additional activity didn't appear to burn any more calories, according to the results published in Current Biology. \"The body works pretty hard to keep energy expenditure in check,\" Pontzer said. Although the \"calories in\" side of the equation--how much you eat--can change, the \"calories out\" side of the equation doesn't want to budge, he said. For weight loss, he said, \"it makes more sense to focus on calorie intake.\" Though this study compared calorie burn in different populations, metabolism from person to person can vary a lot, he noted. MondayMorning/February 8, 2016/Vol. 24/No. 5NEWS BRIEFS  Drug companies are beginning early-stage research to develop a new vaccine against the rapidly spreading Zika virus, joining the race to control an outbreak that the World Health Organization said constitutes a global, public-health emergency. It might be years, however, before any vaccine reaches the market, meaning the new wave of research is unlikely to help curb the current outbreak. Though Zika generally makes people only mildly ill for a few days, it has been linked to a serious birth defect in which babies are born with undersized skulls and brains. To attack Zika, French drugmaker Sanofi SA (Paris) said it would take advantage of the research it did for its newly approved vaccine for dengue fever--the world's first against the mosquito-borne illness. The Zika and dengue viruses are in the same family. \"Theoretically, there could be some cross immunity,\" said Nicholas Jackson, global head of research at the company's Sanofi Pasteur vaccines unit, who will be running the new project. \"We will need to investigate this clinically.\" U.S. biotech company NewLink Genetics Corp. (Ames IA) said it too was working on developing treatment options for the disease. NewLink's infectious-disease team felt that searching for a Zika vaccine \"was a project they could really sink their teeth into,\" said Charles Link, the company's CEO. NewLink hasn't begun human testing of any potential Zika vaccine candidates. \"This is going to take some time and effort,\" said Dr. Link. \"This is not going to be an overnight deal.\" Epidemic diseases generally draw little investment from pharmaceutical companies because demand for those products is sporadic and unpredictable. The WHO, the U.S. government, the pharmaceutical industry and others are working on ways to improve research and development for epidemic diseases, in the wake of the Ebola crisis in West Africa and as new epidemics such as Zika emerge. At least a dozen Ebola vaccine and drug candidates were under development when the virus began to spread in West Africa. Even so, there is still no licensed treatment or vaccine.Some 1,000 Americans a day suffer sudden cardiac arrest, a catastrophic event that seems to come on without warning and almost always results in death unless help is nearby. When these jolts happen outside the hospital, just over 10% of people survive. Now researchers say the events may not always be so sudden. A recent study that analyzed 839 sudden cardiac arrests found that in 430 cases, or 51%, patients exhibited warning signs in the four weeks before the arrest. The victims either failed to recognize the symptoms or ignored them--in most cases until it was too late. The missed symptoms included chest pain, shortness of breath, light-headedness and heart palpitations--classic signs of an impending or actual heart attack. Researchers found evidence of them in medical records, interviews with family and witnesses to the arrest and in the recollection of those who survived. The findings reveal a \"window of opportunity we didn't know existed\" for potentially preventing sudden cardiac arrests, says Sumeet S. Chugh, associate director of the Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and senior author of the study. While previous, smaller studies have shown that people have symptoms very shortly before an event, the idea that patients might experience precursor signs as much as a month in advance hadn't previously been documented, he says. Millions of patients experience chest pain and other symptoms that end up having nothing to do with heart ailments. Even when cardiac problems are confirmed, tests to predict which patients are likely to end up in cardiac arrest aren't available. \"The hours before sudden cardiac arrest are a large black box,\" says Benjamin Abella, clinical research director of the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania, who wasn't involved with the new research. \"This is one of the first studies to peer inside that black box.\" But the results don't address a fundamental dilemma concerning heart symptoms: when should people call 911. \"Should that person have called 911, or sought assistance from his or her physician?\" asks Roger White, an anesthesiologist and cardiac arrest expert at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. \"That sort of question is left completely unanswered.\" Among the 430 patients in the study who had experienced symptoms, 911 was called in just 81, or 19%, or cases; 32% of those patients survived to be discharged from the hospital, compared with just 6% where no call was made. As part of what is known as the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, Dr. Chugh and his colleagues are also gathering genetic data, autopsy findings and information from medical records. They aim to develop a clinical profile that describes who are most likely to benefit from making a 911 call. One hope is that such information might lead to personal technology that people could use to help gauge how to respond to symptoms. For instance, a smartphone app that records electrocardiograms could advise whether a patient is at immediate risk. Another idea, researchers say, is a home test to measure troponins, which are proteins that, when detected in elevated levels in the blood, can indicate heart damage. (Source: Annals of Internal Medicine)Wearable monitors measure heart rate, body temperature and other health indicators. For the first time, a flexible, wearable sensor can collect data about multiple chemicals in body sweat. The device could help people monitor conditions like dehydration and fatigue in real time, said Ali Javey, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the inventors. The sensor could provide an alarm, for instance, that alerts a patient to drink a glass of water or take some medication. Dr. Javey and his colleagues described their system in the journal Nature. \"Lots of studies have shown how and why sweat composition changes, but it was very difficult before to measure this on patients,\" he said. \"The beauty of this is that it is a comfortable and easy-to-wear system.\" Other researchers have been developing sensors for sweat, but this is the first one that breaks down and analyzes multiple chemicals in sweat at a molecular level and transmits measurements in real time, Dr. Javey added. Janey and his colleagues, using flexible plastic substrates, made the prototype from a flexible electronics board and managed to collect information about glucose, lactate, sodium and potassium levels as well as body temperature from test subjects. The sensor transmits the data to a smartphone in real time. The researchers have filed a patent application for the technology. \"We only looked at four different chemicals, but sweat contains much more useful information that tells about what's happening to the body,\" Dr. Javey said.Some U. S. state medical boards are not doing enough to protect the public from doctors who have engaged in sexual misconduct, consumer watchdog Public Citizen said. Between 2003 and 2013, reports of 1,039 physicians having engaged in one or more cases of sexual misconduct were filed in the United States, of which 786 doctors were disciplined by a state medical board, according to a study by Public Citizen. However, 177 of the remaining 253 entirely escaped sanctions from a state medical board, such as revocation or restriction of medical license. The study was based on data from the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB), a nation-wide database set up under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. It covered reports received between Jan. 1, 2003 and Sept. 30, 2013 on disciplinary action taken by state medical boards, review committees at hospitals and other healthcare organizations as well as malpractice payments made by insurers on behalf of physicians. The state medical boards, which have access to the NPDB, need to focus their attention on sexual misconduct that led to disciplinary action by healthcare organizations or to lawsuits, Azza AbuDagga, the lead author of the study, said. Reports related to sexual misconduct accounted for just 1% of all reports in the NPDB, suggesting that such cases were underreported. This could be because victims are unwilling to lodge complaints, given that a majority of the reported cases usually do not result in punishment for the accused. The study authors noted that different state medical boards had different track records when it came to taking serious disciplinary action. \"Some boards are better than others,\" AbuDagga said, adding that states including Nevada, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Tennessee seemed to have the worst track records, according to a previous study. Most of the doctors with sexual misconduct reports were aged 40 or older, the study showed.

Activist investor <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>just announced his latest target: Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., reports the Wall Street Journal. Bristol-Myers has been the focus of several activist investors in recent months and recently the company shook up its board to satisfy other activist investors. Now, the pharmaceutical giant has to deal with a new formidable force, <person><nameText>Carl Icahn. </nameText></person></p><p>Since he announced his position, speculation has spread that the company may be split up and/or sold. For decades, <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>has mastered the skill of shaking up companies and extracting value for him and other shareholders, Forbes points out. Arguably, <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>is the best activist investor in history based on his track record. Bristol-Myers executives are on notice and clearly this will be the topic of conversation in the company for weeks to come. Jana Partners LLC, and other large investors, is also involved in the company. Bristol Myers has been working hard to develop the next big cancer treatment. Due to pressure from Jana and other investors, Bristol-Myers also just announced it would add three directors to its board and repurchase $2 billion in stock. The company is working tirelessly to develop new treatments to combat cancer. Icahn may help breakup the company or try to sell it. Either way, if he does anything big, it could reshape the landscape among a group of companies racing to attack, and ultimately cure, cancer. If the company does sell out, it would probably fetch over $100 billion. Bristol-Myers currently has a market value of about $92 billion. After Bristol-Myers' immunotherapy Opdivo fell short in a key lung cancer study last fall, the company's shares plummeted, analysts cut their sales forecasts by billions, and buyout rumors started surfacing. A sale wouldn't be surprising to some investors and analysts, who've been abuzz about a potential megamerger pairing Bristol-Myers with one of its Big Pharma peers. Last week, unnamed sources told Street Insider that Pfizer, Roche and Novartis were all weighing offers. Given the fact that those pharmas are among the very few that could afford a Bristol-Myers purchase, they are the obvious names that would surface on Wall Street. Pfizer, with its proven appetite for megamergers, easily lends itself to big-deal chatter, says FiercePharma. Plus, Pfizerin particular could soon have a much bigger war chest for acquisitions if President Donald Trump's proposals for a repatriation tax holiday come to fruition. Talk, however, is cheap. With the activist in the mix, the prospect of a sale--or pressure for a sale--suddenly seems more real. Investors certainly thought so; when the WSJ reported Icahn's stake just before last Tuesday's market close, shares shot up to $55.35 at close Wednesday. That puts Bristol-Myers' current market cap at about $92 billion, according to Yahoo Finance, and despite the price tag that number would put on a deal, Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote last month that the company's assets could be worth the cost. \"[W]e believe Opdivo, Yervoy, and the burgeoning immuno-oncology pipeline at BMS is a high-value industry asset that cannot be ignored,\" Fernandez wrote at the time. Shares closed the week up 1% at $41.56.* * * Healthcare IPOs sputter as uncertainty clouds--everything. After a perfectly miserable 2016, IPO issuers have been praying for a New England Patriots-style comeback. CNN says there are reasons to be optimistic. Leading the list are: 1) Historic highs in the stock market, which is the main determinant of IPO activity, and 2) A business-friendly administration with the stated goal of less regulation and lower taxes. IPOs are mostly small-cap companies, and those small-cap companies pay a larger share of taxes and suffer from higher levels of regulation because they lack the lawyers and infrastructure to deal with all the regulations. Any reduction in taxes and regulation would be a major plus for IPOs because it would likely increase the public valuation of the company. For IPOs in 2016, it was the best of times and the worst of times, according to Kathleen Smith at Renaissance Capital. It was the worst of times because there were roughly 105 IPOs, more than 35% below the 170 IPOs in 2015. But CNN contends it also was a pretty good time if you were an investor in the minuscule number that did go public. Buyers were skeptical, so IPO issuers had to cut the prices. The average price relative to the midpoint of the expected price range was minus 7%. In other words, if an IPO was expected to price between $19 and $21, the midpoint was $20. The actual average price was 7% below that, or $18.60. As of mid December, the average return on a 2016 IPO was 26.9%, according to Renaissance Capital. And it wasn't all on the first day of trading. The average first-day pop was 11.9%, so there were also substantial returns after that first day. Why did the IPO market dry up in 2016? Smith says it's not a mystery: \"There was a huge hit in returns in the beginning of the year, and valuations were reset downward. The market didn't gear up again until the middle of the year, then Brexit hit. Then the election hit.\" In early February, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals pulled the plug on an initial public offering that it hoped would bring in $150 million to boost the development of a drug to treat opioid addiction. It had just announced the IPO two weeks earlier, about the time that Donald Trump was sworn in as president. But after a series of moves by the President-elect that included blasting Big Pharma CEOs for high drug prices and meeting with controversial candidates to head up the FDA, Braeburn's executives abruptly decided the market environment \"does not represent an appropriate financing opportunity,\" the company said in a statement. Braeburn is far from the only biopharma company to decide to stay away from Wall Street, at least in the short term. Visterra, which is developing antibody-based treatments for Zika and other infectious diseases, announced plans to raise about $50 million in an IPO on January 17 but postponed on February 9, citing market conditions, according to Renaissance Capital. The delays came after a jittery fourth quarter, which turned out to be the slowest quarter for biotech IPOs since 2012, Bloomberg reported. When it comes to drug prices, Trump sent a chill through the pharma industry before he even took office with the charge that drug companies are \"getting away with murder.\" On January 31, he hosted a group of Big Pharma CEOs at the White House, during which he implored them to lower prices and move jobs back to the US. But biotech companies--which typically remain unprofitable for years as they spend heavily on R...euro;\"rely on the ability to charge high prices so they can recoup their investment, Drone points out. Despite the controversies in D.C., some biopharma companies have pulled off successful IPOs this year. They include AnaptysBio, which raised $75 million to develop treatments for inflammatory disease, and cancer drug developer Jounce Therapeutics, which pulled in $120 million. Their shares are up 54% and 35% respectively. Other recent biotech premieres on the Street haven't done quite as well. ObsEva, which is focused on women's health, has fallen from its $15 offering price to $12.55.* * * Trumpcare slowly imploding; perhaps morphing into Obamacare 2. 0? Six years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act has demonstrated it's far from perfect. But replacing such an immense, complicated law on an accelerated schedule is presenting enormous political, let alone practical, problems for the GOP. Republican promises to dismantle President Obama's signature healthcare overhaul are the backbone of their curveball to voters since the law's 2010 passage. With full control of Washington now at hand, however, the GOP must deliver. And the White House, in particular, is learning that replacing the elaborate, complex structure for one-sixth of the economy doesn't just happen uttering more words to the effect that someday, it will happen. President Trump is getting ready to unveil a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a clear goal: \"Insurance for everybody.\" Trump told the Washington Post that his plan will also not involve cuts for Medicare and will target pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. \"We're going to have insurance for everybody,\" Trump said. \"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.\" There's no reason to be worried because those who will be covered under the new law \"can expect to have great health care\" that will be \"much less expensive and much better.\" How does the President plan to do all this? He still won't say. Trump hasn't offered details on the plan itself or what it could cost. He also won't say how he plans to persuade Congressional Republicans to get behind his plan, if one penned by HHS Secretary Tom Price ever gets to Congress. But he did say he would be unveiling the plan--that is \"very much formulated to the final strokes\"--with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, suggesting he's got support from key GOP leaders. Still, Trump's words would appear to fly in the face of what many Republicans have been advocating while using the term \"universal access\" to describe their goals rather than \"universal coverage,\" says Daniel Politi for Slate. Even as Trump suggests he's in a rush to repeal and replace Obamacare, lawmakers appear increasingly skittish. Although Congress did take the first step to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the harder part of putting together a plan is still to come. The reason for the concern is obvious: Some 20 million people now are covered, and many aspects of the law are quite popular.* * * Medical Stock Spotlight: EyeGate Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq) led advancing issues, soaring 74% over the week to $2.85 after an announcement of the company's $4 million licensing agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. The deal is for exclusive, global commercial and manufacturing rights for EyeGate's EyeGate II Delivery System, which is an alternative to eye drops and ocular injections, and EGP-437 combination product, which is being developed for post-operative pain and inflammation in patients who've had ocular surgery. The deal consists of cash upfront for Waltham, MA-based EyeGate, and up to $99 million in potential milestone payments and royalties on Valeant's net sales of the product, according to an EyeGate Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Valeant had previously licensed the same product, EGP-437, from EyeGate for uveitis in 2015. EyeGate reported positive results from an early/mid-stage trial in December. Elsewhere, Community Health Systems Inc. (NYSE) rocketed 34% to $9.22 following a positive earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2016. The hospital operator reported revenue of $4.47 billion for the fourth quarter of the year. This is a decrease from the $4.80 billion that reported during the same period last year. However, it came in above Wall Street's revenue estimate of $4.39 billion for the quarter. In the latest quarter, Franklin, TN-based Community reported earnings per share of 46 cents. This beat its losses per share of 28 cents reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. It also came in well above analysts' earnings per share estimate of 13 cents for the fourth quarter of the year. Community Health also released its guidance for 2017. The company is expecting revenue for the year to be between $15.8 and 16.2 billion. Wall Street is expecting the company to report revenue of $17.07 billion. And Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq) shares surged 26% to $3.27 after the company said a district judge had ruled in its favor in a patent infringement case against Actavis Laboratories, which is part of Allergan. The judge said Actavis could not make or sell a generic of Pernix's Zohydro ER, an opioid pain medication, until two patents expire in 2019 and 2034. Pernix shares have risen 17.2% over the last three months, compared with a 7.4% rise in the S...00. \"We are pleased with the Court's decision as it confirms the strength and longevity of the Zohydro ER patent portfolio,\" said John Sedor, Chairman and CEO of Pernix. \"Zohydro ER is a core component of our product portfolio and we look forward to driving continued growth of the franchise.\" But Argos Therapeutics Inc. plunged 74% to $1.23 after saying an independent data monitoring committee recommended the Phase 3 trial of its treatment for renal cell carcinoma be \"discontinued for futility,\" based on an interim data analysis. The committee said the study is unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, which is the study's primary endpoint. \"We are extremely disappointed with these results, which included 75% of the targeted events needed to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival in the study,\" said Argos Chief Executive Jeff Abbey. Durham, NC-based Argos said it will determine the next steps for the treatment after it discusses the data with the Food and Drug Administration. And Trevena Inc. (Nasdaq) plummeted 44% to $3.99 after announcing top-line results from two phase 3 trials evaluating its lead drug, oliceridine, in treating moderate-to-severe acute pain after the removal of bunions (bunionectomy) or a \"tummy tuck\" operation (abdominoplasty). The move may be confusing considering that the drug met its primary endpoints in all dosing regimens compared to morphine. The King of Prussia, PA-based company even plans to file a New Drug Application with the Food and Drug Administration based on the top-line data. But investors are concerned that the drug's performance against secondary endpoints may limit the drug's market potential once approved by regulators. The intravenously administered drug received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, which demonstrated early potential to at least match morphine in efficacy and beat it in reducing side effects.* * * Eyeing big $$$, tech titans Microsoft, IBM plunge into health care with snazzy startups; but will the docs buy in? Last week, Microsoft Inc. (Redmond WA) joined other tech giants IBM, Apple, and Alphabet heralding a new initiative called Healthcare NExT which will combine work from existing industry players and its Research and AI units. The ambitious launch aims to help doctors reduce&gt; The company's success will depend upon healthcare providers. Hospitals, for example, are fundamentally operated through a mostly benign relationship between two core constituencies: the administration and the medical staff. Both have their distinct roles in running a successful endeavor to care for patients. But when the rubber meets the road, the doctors usually win the day. It's crucial for hospital administration to keep the medical staff \"happy,\" or defections can lead to major reductions in the patient's they may take with them and the associated billings that can wind up with arch rivals. Pharma companies learned this lesson decades ago when trying to sell their products. Unless you've got a stranglehold on the market via an FDA monopoly, if there's competition among several drugs to treat a particular illness, it's all about persuading doctors to write the prescription for your offering and not a competitor's, says Steve Walker at MondayMorning.com. Jo Best at ZDNet reports on a real-life situation typifying IBMWatson's system for helping doctors diagnose the most rare and elusive illnesses faster by scanning through mountains of medical records to pull out only the relevant data. Germany's Marburgs Centre for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases has begun evaluating whether Watson has a role to play in helping identify conditions that doctors may only come across once in their careers. Typically, the patients arriving at the centre may turn up with inch-thick medical records stuffed with unstructured&gt; \"Once patients show up [at the centre], they are highly complex to get a handle on and we are busy for a couple of days just reviewing the paperwork,\" Marburg's Dr. Jurgen Sch\u0192fer said. \"It is clear to us that either we keep that old way of huge amounts of information on paper and work through it for days and days or weeks, or we set up a new system, where IT support screens the findings and gets out the information.\" The objective in the future is to feed all that information into Watson, and let the system crunch the data before arriving at a differential diagnosis--a list of potential illnesses that all fit the patient's symptoms--which will be handed to human medical staff to work out which of those conditions the patient has. And, if Watson spots a seemingly anomalous result amidst all the data, it can highlight it so that doctors can follow it up (or disregard it and carry out the test again). While Watson could theoretically aid further in the diagnosis by weighting each of the illnesses that make up the differential diagnosis according to their likelihood, Sch\u0192fer says there may be pitfalls to such an approach. \"We need to be sure that if Watson would supply the [likely condition], there is a concern that at the end the physician gives up thinking. \u20actilde;It's 90% that it's a myocardial infarction, that's good enough,\" but if it's a one% chance that it's an aortic dissection, which is also a deadly disease, you take the risk that no one thinks about this. We are discussing currently if we want to use this feature.\"* * * Tracking Washington: The House GOP and the Trump administration said they need another three months to come to a resolution regarding the payments that reduce the deductibles and co-pays for more than half of enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges, according to a motion filed in the US Court of Appeals on Tuesday. These subsidies were at the center of a court battle between House Republicans and the Obama administration. Seeking to bring down Obamacare, the House filed suit against then-Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell in 2014, arguing the payments to insurers were illegal because Congress never appropriated the money, CNN reports. A district court judge last year ruled in favor of the House, finding the subsidies were illegal and must stop. However, she stayed her decision, and the Obama administration filed an appeal. The subsidies continue to be paid during the appeal, according to a senior GOP source. Now that the White House has changed hands, House GOP lawmakers are in the uncomfortable situation of suing Health Secretary Tom Price, who took over after Burwell and is one of their own. It's widely expected that Republicans will agree to pay the subsidies, which are expected to cost $9 billion this year and $11 billion next year. Killing them would wreak havoc in the individual market. Many insurers depend on these payments--without them, they might abandon Obamacare, which could lead to fewer choices and higher premiums for consumers. Such a move would be at odds with the \"orderly transition\" that Republicans have promised. Already, Humana has said it will not participate in the individual market in 2018. Other insurers have said they are reviewing their plans for next year. MondayMorning/February 27, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 8 CORPORATE Bayer reports 7% jump in Q4 sales, led by Eylea, Xarelto. Bayer AG (Leverkusen DEU) announced Wednesday that fourth-quarter sales of prescription drugs rose 7.3% year-over-year to 4.3 billion euros ($4.5 billion), with revenue from key growth products including Eylea and Xarelto increasing \"robustly.\" The company noted that sales of key growth products, which also include Adempas, Stivarga and Xofigo, reached 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in the three-month period, up 24.3% on a constant currency basis. Shares closed the week off 2% at 106.40 euros in Frankfurt. \"Sales at pharmaceuticals advanced by a gratifying amount,\" remarked CEO Werner Baumann, adding \"we expanded business markedly in all regions.\" In the quarter, sales of Xarelto climbed 28.6% versus the prior-year period to 836 million euros ($879 million), while revenue from Eylea jumped 20.3% to 426 million euros ($448 million). Bayer's overall sales in quarter lifted 4.7% to 11.8 billion euros ($12.4 billion), while net income plunged 26.1% to 453 million euros ($476 million), missing analysts' expectations of 712 million euros ($748 million). Meanwhile, three-monthly sales in the company's consumer health division rose 2.2% to 1.5 billion euros. For 2016, sales of prescription drugs also climbed 7.3% to 16.4 billion euros ($17.2 billion), with revenue from key growth products jumping 28% to 5.4 billion euros ($5.7 billion), up from 4.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in the prior year. Bayer noted that overall sales increased 1.5% in 2016 to 46.8 billion euros ($49.2 billion), while net income lifted 10.2% to 4.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion). For the current year, the company expects sales of pharmaceuticals of more than 17 billion euros ($17.9 billion), representing mid-single-digit percentage growth, with combined revenue from Adempas, Eylea, Stivarga, Xarelto and Xofigo above 6 billion euros ($6.3 billion). Bayer's overall sales are predicted to be above 49 billion euros ($51.5 billion), corresponding to a low- to mid-single-digit percentage increase, with earnings rising by a mid-single-digit percentage.* * * Stada receives binding takeover offer from Advent. Stada Arzneimittel AG (Bad Vilbel DEU) confirmed Thursday that it has received a binding offer from private equity firm Advent International Corp. (Boston) valued at 58 euros ($61.32) per share, or 3.6 billion euros ($3.8 billion). Advent noted that the offer represents about a 66% premium to Stada's share price on March 31, 2016 before share purchases by activist investors became public. The companies noted that the offer is limited until February 27, and subject to the endorsement from Stada's management board. Shares closed the week up off 26 cents to 57.75 euros in Frankfurt. Stada announced earlier this month that it had received two non-binding takeover offers, including an offer from private equity group Cinven valued at 56 euros ($59.21) per share. The drugmaker later said that it had entered into negotiations with Advent and Cinven, while the company also disclosed the receipt of a third non-binding offer worth 58 euros per share. According to three sources, information on Stada's business provided to Advent prompted the buyout firm to proceed with the offer, noting that the limited information available to the two other bidders has precluded them from making binding offers. The people added that the move could pressure Stada to provide more access to its financial records. Advent stressed that its offer was fully financed, adding that it has no plans to break up the drugmaker's businesses. \"Advent would support Stada as a strong and experienced partner to expand its leading market position, to maintain its independence, and to push international expansion,\" Advent stated. Meanwhile, Stada said its \"executive board will review the offer in the best interest of the company and will continue the open-minded talks with all interested parties.\"* * * Merck records big write-down for experimental hep C drug as market tanks. Merck .... (Kenilworth NJ) disclosed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will record a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.9 billion related to its research program for uprifosbuvir, a nucleotide prodrug in clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C. The drug, also known as MK-3682, was obtained via the $3.9-billion purchase of Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014. Shares closed the week up 1% at $66.16. According to Merck, \"recent changes to the product profile, as well as changes to its expectations for pricing and the market opportunity, taken together constituted a triggering event that required the company to evaluate the uprifosbuvir intangible asset for impairment.\" The company concluded that its \"best estimate of the current fair value\" of uprifosbuvir is $240 million. Commenting on the news, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Asthika Goonewardene said \"they are either seeing that the value of the hepatitis C market, when they are able to launch their product, isn't worth the further investment, or they are seeing safety or efficacy signals that doesn't make this as compelling.\" However, Merck noted that uprifosbuvir's safety and efficacy didn't play a role in its decision, which was made on February 17. The drugmaker indicated that the charge, which is $1.9 billion after taxes, will be reflected in its 2016 results. Merck added that as a result, earnings for the fourth quarter will be reduced from $0.42 to a loss of $0.22. The company said that it \"continues to evaluate options with respect to the uprifosbuvir clinical development program.\" Merck's decision also comes after Gilead Sciences Inc. (Foster City CA) announced earlier this month that full-year revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $27.9 billion. Gilead noted at the time that sales of its hepatitis C therapies are estimated to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $9 billion, down from $14.8 billion in 2016, as a result of competition from other therapies, shorter treatment duration and fewer new patients starting on the drugs.ROCHE HOLDINGS AG. 's (Basel CHE) Genentech unit has sued Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks CA) for not giving up the info Genentech experts need to mount a patent infringement attack on Amgen's biosimilar for Avastin, its $6.8 billion blockbuster. In the latest legal battle, Genentech argues if it doesn't get that data ASAP, the \"consequences are potentially disastrous.\" A complaint filed last Wednesday in US District Court in Delaware, says Roche wants the court to force Amgen to cough up all the data it says it needs, allow Roche to have experts evaluate it and then reset the deadlines for resolving any patent disputes. It asks the court to block Amgen from selling its biosimilar to Avastin until this legal fight has played out, according to FiercePharma. Roche says the so-called \"patent dance\" requirements that Amgen must follow are laid out in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). The law was established to hasten cheaper biosimilars to market by allowing developers to rely on much of the development work done by the original drug developer but also provide drug originators ways to assert their patent rights. The law says in one pathway to approval, once the FDA accepts an Abbreviated Biologic License Application for the biosimilar, the applicant has 20 days to provide the drug's originator the aBLA and \"such other information that describes the process or processes used to manufacture the biological product.\" Then the originator, Genentech in this case, has 60 days to review it with experts and say what patents it believes might be infringed and how. The clock started to tick Jan. 4 when the FDA accepted Amgen's application. But Roche says Amgen has provided only its aBLA, claiming that satisfied its obligation and should be all Roche needs to do its evaluation. It also blasts Amgen in the filing for an \"about-face.\" It points out that Amgen had a different attitude when one of its own drugs was under attack by a biosimilar. When \"Hospira, produced only its aBLA after applying for FDA approval for a biosimilar of Amgen's blockbuster Epogen--exactly the same conduct Amgen has engaged in here--Amgen sued Hospira in this district for noncompliance with the BPCIA...,\" the filing says. In that case, Amgen argued \"a patent owner cannot fully protect itself as Congress intended if the applicant only produces its aBLA, because many important details about the product are normally omitted,\" Roche declares in its filing. Roche is hoping to get a hearing and a ruling ASAP, since time is running short for it to fight Amgen's application.AETNA INC. (Hartford CT) will spend $3.3 billion to buy back more than 20 million shares of its stock after the health insurer's board authorized more repurchases last week. The nation's third largest insurer said last Wednesday that it entered into accelerated buyback agreements with two dealers for about 10.4 million shares from each. Aetna will pay each dealer $1.65 billion and is using available cash to fund the deals, according to the Associated Press. Aetna had said on Friday that its board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $4 billion worth of the company's stock. The company also said it was doubling the quarterly dividend it pays stock owners to 50 cents per share. That announcement came a few days after Aetna called off its roughly $34 billion acquisition of Medicare Advantage provider Humana Inc. That deal had already been rejected by a judge after federal regulators sued last summer to stop both it and a similar combination of the insurers Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. Shares of Aetna Inc. have climbed more than 3% since the insurer announced the end of the Humana deal. They closed the week 1% to $3.70.BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP. (Marlborough MA) said on Thursday it was recalling its Lotus range of heart devices, citing reports of problems with the locking mechanism, sending its shares down 2% for the week to $24.78. The company also delayed the submission of its US marketing application for its keenly anticipated Lotus Edge device, giving its rivals an edge in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, according to Reuters. Boston Scientific's Lotus technology is used in TAVR, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a narrowed aortic valve that fails to open properly. The TAVR market--in which Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (Irvine CA) is considered the leader--could potentially exceed $5 billion by 2021, and grow 10% to 15% for the foreseeable future, Leerink analysts said in a note. The interventional cardiology market can be unforgiving for multiple product missteps and this is perhaps the company's last chance to maintain brand equity and clinician interest, Stifel analysts said. Boston Scientific's Lotus devices are expected to return to the European market and other regions in the fourth quarter, it said, noting the issue was caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism that was introduced during manufacturing. The company had suspended implants of its next-generation Lotus Edge device in Europe last October over similar concerns, but said last month it had found a fix for the issue. Boston Scientific on Thursday also pushed the submission of its marketing application for the device in the United States to the fourth quarter, and said it now expects to launch it in mid-2018. It had previously expected to submit the application in May and get an approval by the end of 2017. Analysts had previously forecast $100 million to $125 million in global sales for its Lotus devices in 2017. Boston Scientific said it is not updating its full-year forecast, but has lowered its structural heart revenue expectations by $50 million, which translates into a 2 cent impact on its earnings per share, Evercore ISI's Vijay Kumar said. Shares closed the week off 2% at $24.78.PFIZERINC. (New York City) has scored new Crohn's disease data that could give its Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra, a new boost to its market-share fight, one of the first head-to-head US matchups between a top biologic drug and a biosimilar alternative. Launched late last year, Inflectra came out of the gate approved for several uses, including moderate-to-severe Crohn's, says FiercePharma. But until now, Pfizerhasn't had Crohn's-specific data, and Johnson ...hnson has used that fact to argue against uptake of the biosim, an analyst said. That argument could now be moot. In the new head-to-head study against the J...rug, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) met its primary goal: Demonstrating that its results and side effects were comparable to Remicade's in Crohn's patients. The measurements were taken at the six-week mark. The 214-patient trial is intended to run for 54 weeks, with patients in each arm randomized to switch (or not) to the other drug at week 30. Pharma-watchers are keeping a close eye on Inflectra, the first biosimilar alternative to Remicade launched in the US It made its stateside debut at a list price 15% lower than the brand, Pfizersaid; negotiations with payers may have yielded further discounts. J...aintains that biosims \"are not generics,\" and execs say that they're not expecting a stampede to Remicade knockoffs in the US Plus, J...as some discount programs of its own. When Inflectra launched, the company said Remicade's market is already \"extremely competitive\" on price and that J...as working up \"innovative contracts\" to \"utilize the full breadth\" of its portfolio. \"We feel well prepared to face the biosimilar,\" Joaquin Duato, pharma group chairman, said on the company's Q3 earnings call.FDA/EMA ROUNDUP: The US Food and Drug Administration granted priority review to Novartis AG's (Basel CHE) application seeking expanded approval of Zykadia (ceritinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are ALK-positive, the company reported Thursday. The drugmaker added that the agency also granted breakthrough therapy designation to the oral drug for the first-line treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC with metastases to the brain. According to Novartis, the submission is based on data from the Phase 3 ASCEND-4 study, which the company said last year met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus standard chemotherapy. Elsewhere, Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (Boston) disclosed that it entered an agreement to sell its rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, which was obtained last year when the FDA approved Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) for certain patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, to Gilead Sciences Inc. (Foster City CA) for $125 million. Sarepta CEO Edward Kaye noted that the transaction \"provides an important source of non-dilutive capital to support the rapid advancement of our follow on exon skipping candidates and next generation RNA targeted antisense platform.\" Commenting on the news, Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz indicated that the price tag for Sarepta's priority review voucher was short of his projection of $200 million. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Rancho CucamongaCA) announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding the company's filing seeking approval of intranasal naloxone for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose. According to Amphastar, the agency identified issues including user human factors study, device evaluation and other items that need to be addressed before the drug can be cleared. CEO Jack Zhang said, \"while we are disappointed to have not received approval at this time, we intend to continue to work with the FDA to address their concerns.\" Amphastar indicated that it will continue to offer naloxone in pre-filled syringes while it seeks approval of the nasal spray version. And in Europe, Novartis's (Basel CHE) drugs Tafinlar and Mekinist edged closer to approval to be used together against a type of lung cancer after a key committee on Friday published a recommendation to expand the combination's indications. The European Medicine Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist for adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a mutation. The EMA still must issue a final decision. Novartis, whose combination competes with Roche's Cotellic and Zelboraf, said in a statement that its drugs will be the first targeted therapy for BRAF V600-mutated NSCLC patients if the EMA follows the recommendation, as is likely. MondayMorning/February 27, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 8 Weekly Stock Performance (as of February 24, 2017)MondayMorning/February 27, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 8WALL ST./FINANCE Equities rallied in the last half-hour of trading Friday to recover losses from earlier in the session, as investors set their sights on US President Donald Trump's speech before Congress next week. Gold extended its strong run as the dollar turned lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 0.05%, has now hit daily highs for 11 consecutive sessions, its longest streak of records since 1987. The S...00 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index also finished higher, while the Russell 2000 Index lost ground. \"Markets are pricing in the Trump agenda and they're pricing in lot of high expectations,\" Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investments in New York, said. The firm oversees more than $258 billion. \"The likelihood that there are going to be some legislative and political bumps on the road is certainly very high. A rally predicated on political policy can expect some volatility within it.\" Gold rose for a fourth week after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that he expects low borrowing costs to persist, sparking a drop in the dollar. Oil pared a weekly advance, while silver headed for the longest run of weekly gains since 2006. The rally in global equities that helped push their value above $70 trillion is losing momentum as money managers grapple with political uncertainty and the Federal Reserve's schedule for lifting borrowing costs. In Trump's address before a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28, the president is expected to lay out his plans for tax and healthcare reform and infrastructure spending. With all the uncertainty surrounding the administration's programs, the equities markets are taking a wary stance heading into the weekend before the speech. \"There have been some hints about the type of corporate income tax reform that the administration might deliver--a broadening of the base and cuts to the tax rates--markets are still waiting for the 2017 key draft fiscal budget,\" researchers at Barclays PLC including chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note Friday. \"We think that the presentation to Congress will be a good opportunity for the president to more clearly flesh out his policy priorities and goals, especially on trade, taxes, and public investment.\" Apropos of such address, the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's \"fear\" gauge known as the VIX, slipped 0.2% on the week to 11.47. For the week, the S...00 leaped 16.18, or 0.69%, to 2,367.34. The Dow shot up 119.71, or 0.96%, to 20,821.76. The Nasdaq tacked on 6.73, or 0.12%, to 5,845.31.* * * 02/27: IPO Sector: Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is commercializing a long-acting implant for treatment of opioid addiction, withdrew its plans for an initial public offering on Wednesday, citing the current market environment. It had filed in late December to raise $150 million by offering 7.7 million shares at a price range of $18 to $21. The Princeton, NJ-based company was founded in 2012. It had planned to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"BBRX.\" J.P. Morgan, BofAMerrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank were set to be the joint bookrunners on the deal, according to Renaissance Capital. This decision does not preclude Braeburn and its sole shareholder Apple Tree Partners from considering an IPO or an alternative financing in the future, the company said in a statement.MondayMorning/February 27, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 8Weekly Key Rates Prev.

Patients who started with low fitness levels but were able to improve to intermediate or high fitness levels reduced their risk of death during the study by roughly 40%, say the authors. Exercise capacity is measured during an exercise stress test, which is typically performed on a treadmill or stationary bike. Someone with a higher maximal exercise capacity is able to achieve a faster walking pace or climb more stairs before getting tired, lead author Clinton Brawner told Reuters Health in an email interview. \"Maximal exercise capacity is our ability to do work. It is dependent on the health of the heart, lungs, blood, and muscles,\" said Brawner, who is a researcher at the Edith and Benson Ford Heart and Vascular Institute at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. \"More importantly, higher exercise capacity means an individual is able to complete activities of daily living, like working around the house, more easily and with less fatigue than someone with a lower exercise capacity,\" Brawner said. While there is a wealth of data to support the relationship between fitness and outcomes, like premature death, there are only a few studies that have evaluated whether changes in fitness are related to outcomes and none included women, said Brawner. To address that knowledge gap, Brawner and colleagues analyzed data from the Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT) project, which involved adults from Detroit, Michigan who underwent physician-ordered exercise stress tests on treadmills between 1991 and 2009. As reported in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the study team looked at more than 10,000 patients who performed two exercise stress tests at least one year apart. After an average follow up of 8.6 years, 9.5% of the men and 7.4% of the women had died. Compared to women who maintained low fitness levels at both tests, the women who improved from low fitness levels on the first test to intermediate or high fitness levels on the second test were 37% less likely to have died. Men who improved from low fitness levels at baseline to intermediate or high fitness levels were about 44% less likely to have died compared to men who hadn't moved out of the low fitness category.Older adults who started sleeping more than nine hours a night--but had not previously slept so much--were at more than double the risk of developing dementia a decade later than those who slept nine hours or less, researchers report. The increased risk was not seen in people who had always slept more than nine hours. \"We're not suggesting you go wake up Grandpa. We think this might be a marker for the risk of dementia, not a cause\" of the illness, said Dr. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine and the senior author of the study, in Neurology. Using data from 2,457 people, average age 72, who were part of a study in Framingham, MA, the researchers found that those with a new habit of excessive slumber were at a greater risk of all forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's, which is characterized by a buildup of beta amyloid, a toxic protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain. \"My suspicion is that this is a compensatory mechanism: that at a time when amyloid is building up in the brain, people may be sleeping longer as the body is reacting and trying to remove it from the brain,\" Dr. Seshadri added, cautioning that is only a hypothesis.A preliminary study using the Apple Watch app, EpiWatch, which is built using Apple Inc's (Cupertino CA) ResearchKit to track seizures in people with epilepsy found that triggers are often stress and missed sleep, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) reported. The data will be presented at the AAN's annual meeting next month. In the 10-month study, 598 people tracked their seizures with the EpiWatch app, which recorded participants' heart rate and movements for 10 minutes when they felt a seizure aura starting. \"The app asked them to perform tasks to test responsiveness. After the seizure ended, participants were given a brief survey about seizure type, aura, loss of awareness and possible seizure triggers,\" the AAN said. The study found that 40% of the participants tracked a total of 1485 seizures, with 177 participants reporting what triggered their seizures. While stress was linked to 37% of seizures, lack of sleep was identified as a trigger for 18% of the seizures, with menstruation identified for 12% of seizures and overexertion for 11% of the seizures. \"Other reported triggers included diet, missed medications and fever or infection,\" the AAN said. Study author Gregory Krauss said \"the data collected will help researchers better understand epilepsy, while helping people with epilepsy keep a more complete history of their seizures.\" He added that \"the app also provides helpful tracking of seizures, prescription medication use and drug side effects.\" Krauss remarked \"our eventual goal is to be able to use wearable technology to predict an oncoming seizure,\" adding that \"the data collected in this study help us take a step in that direction.\" In October 2015, Apple announced that its open source ResearchKit software framework was being used in new studies on autism, epilepsy and melanoma. At the time, the company said the epilepsy study conducted by Johns Hopkins University using the EpiWatch app, which was launched that same month, was the \"first study of its kind to be conducted with Apple Watch using ResearchKit.\"IBM Research announced that researchers have trained a research version of Watson to recognize abnormalities in retina images. The company noted that the advancement could \"offer doctors greater insights and speed in their early identification of patients who may be at risk of eye diseases, such as glaucoma.\" Joanna Batstone, lab director at IBMResearch Australia, remarked that \"medical image analysis with cognitive technology has the capacity to fundamentally change the delivery of healthcare services,\" adding that \"cognitive technology holds immense promise for confirming the accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency of clinicians' analyses during the diagnostic workflow.\" The company noted that while the research began in 2015, the latest work focused on streamlining some of the physicians' manual processes, such as evaluating the quality of retina scans and ranking possible indicators of glaucoma. Specifically, the researchers applied deep learning techniques and image analytics technology to 88 000 de-identified retina images, showing Watson's ability to measure the \"ratio of the optic cup to disc, which is a key sign of glaucoma, with statistical performance as high as 95%,\" IBM said. Further, the technology was trained to distinguish between left and right eye images with up to 94-percent confidence. IBM added that the technology is expected to expand \"to detect features of other eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.\" Last June, IBM Research announced plans to undertake research with Melanoma Institute Australia to help further advance the identification of melanoma using cognitive technology. IBM also has a research agreement with Molemap, which uses advanced visual analytics to examine more than 40 000 data sets including images and text. MondayMorning/February 27, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 8NEWS BRIEFS  Doctors who feel burned out or overwhelmed by the demands of work are less likely to view their work with patients as a \"calling\" that has meaning, according to a recent study. Burnout--characterized by emotional exhaustion, a loss of a sense of self-identity and a reduced sense of accomplishment--can happen in any occupation, the researchers write in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Burnout among doctors has been linked to lower patient satisfaction, more medical errors and higher healthcare costs, the researchers write. \"If physicians only view their occupation as a job, that has implications over time in terms of their commitment to their patients,\" said senior author Dr. Audiey Kao, vice president of ethics at the American Medical Association (AMA). \"That's why we were interested in looking at work identity or physician's sense of calling and what may undermine or support that notion,\" Kao told Reuters Health. To determine how burnout may be linked to doctors' view of medicine as a meaningful calling, the study team surveyed over 2,000 US doctors across all specialties. The doctors, recruited from an AMA database, completed mail-in surveys between October 2014 and May 2015. Participants rated their level of burnout on a scale of 1 to 5, with scores of 1 and 2 indicating no symptoms of burnout. The doctors also answered true/false questions assessing whether they viewed medicine as a calling, for example, whether they had a strong desire to commit their lives to doing this work. The responses to the questions about medicine as a calling varied widely. Over 93% of doctors found their work rewarding, while only 44% said they would continue their work without pay if they didn't need the money. Doctors who were more burned out were more likely to answer \"false\" to questions about whether they viewed their work as a calling. For example, among doctors with no burnout symptoms who enjoyed their work, 93% said they would choose their work life again, while less than a third of doctors in the most burned-out category said the same. Doctors with the highest degree of burnout had much lower odds of calling their work rewarding, one of the most important things in their lives and agreeing that it was making the world a better place. Burned out doctors were also less likely to enjoy talking about their work with others and to say they would choose the same work life again or continue with their current work even if they were not paid. \"Some researchers in the field have described burnout as an experience of dislocation between what people are doing versus what they aspired to do,\" Dr. John Yoon, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, said. Yoon's own research suggests that burned out doctors are more likely to work in environments that they feel are driven by profits. \"The healthcare workplace is changing quite dramatically, for better and for worse, and so the changes affect how doctors view their work every day and therefore their work identity,\" Kao noted. One common change is that doctors are increasingly overwhelmed with paperwork, which may affect their perception of their work, Kao said.\"Everyone, including doctors, wants to be doing work that contributes to some greater good beyond themselves==work that feels authentic to who they are without compromising their integrity,\" said Yoon, who was not involved in the study. \"Having physicians who view their work as a sense of calling is not only important for physicians but as important if not more important for the patients they care for,\" Kao said.Boston Scientific Corp (Marlborough MA) said on Thursday it was recalling its Lotus range of heart devices, citing reports of problems with the locking mechanism. The news sent its shares down 2% for the week to $24.78. The company also delayed the submission of its US marketing application for its keenly anticipated Lotus Edge device, giving its rivals an edge in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, according to Reuters. Boston Scientific's Lotus technology is used in TAVR, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a narrowed aortic valve that fails to open properly. The TAVR market--in which Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (Irvine CA) is considered the leader--could potentially exceed $5 billion by 2021, and grow 10% to 15% for the foreseeable future, Leerink analysts said in a note. The interventional cardiology market can be unforgiving for multiple product missteps and this is perhaps the company's last chance to maintain brand equity and clinician interest, Stifel analysts said. Boston Scientific's Lotus devices are expected to return to the European market and other regions in the fourth quarter, it said, noting the issue was caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism that was introduced during manufacturing.

Shares closed the week off 2% at $24.78.Celgene Inc (Summit NJ) reported Friday that the experimental drug ozanimod met the primary endpoint of a Phase 3 study in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The company's oral, selective S1P 1 and 5 receptor modulator demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements versus Biogen Inc.'s (Cambridge MA) Avonex (interferon beta-1a) in reducing annualized relapse rates. Scott Smith, president of inflammation and immunology at Celgene, said \"we look forward to data from the confirmatory Phase 3 RADIANCE trial in the second quarter as we advance toward planned regulatory submissions by year-end.\" In the SUNBEAM study, 1346 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomized to treatment with ozanimod, at one of two doses, or weekly treatment with Avonex for at least 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study was the annualized relapse rate, while secondary goals were the number of new or enlarging hyper-intense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and the number of gadolinium-enhancing brain MRI lesions at month 12. Top-line results from the study illustrated that ozanimod at both doses was associated with significant improvements regarding the primary endpoint and both secondary endpoints versus Avonex. Celgene said that based on its special protocol assessment with the FDA, a pre-specified analysis of the time to onset of disability progression will be performed using pooled results from the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE trials. The drugmaker added that the safety and tolerability prolife of ozanimod in the study was consistent with previous findings. Celgene acquired rights to ozanimod as part of its $7.2-billion purchase of Receptos in 2015. The company is also developing the drug for other immune-inflammatory indications including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.Following a diet that mimics fasting may reduce risk factors for disease in generally healthy people, according to a small study. Dr. Min Wei of UCLA's Longevity Institute and colleagues tested the effects of the fasting-mimicking diet on various risk factors for diabetes, heart disease, cancer or other conditions. The diet (FMD; brand name ProLon) is low in calories, sugars and protein but high in unsaturated fats. Forty-eight study participants ate normally for three months while 52 ate FMD for five days each month and ate normally the rest of the time. After three months, the groups switched regimens. Although all participants were considered healthy, some had high blood pressure, low levels of \"good\" cholesterol, and other risk factors. A total of 71 people completed the study, which was published in Science Translational Medicine. Body mass index, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol improved with FMD, but mainly for those who were already at risk. Side effects were mild, including fatigue, weakness and headaches. Wei and Dr. Valter Longo of the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview published in the journal that while \"the great majority\" of participants had one or more risk factors for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease or cancer, \"FDA trials will be necessary to demonstrate whether periodic FMD is effective in disease prevention and treatment.\" Dr. Joseph Antoun, CEO of L-Nutra Inc., which produces FMD, told Reuters Health that FMD \"is intended for use by individuals who want to optimize their health and wellbeing, by overweight or obese individuals who want to manage their weight in an easy and healthy way, and by people who have abnormal levels of biomarkers for aging and age-related conditions.\" That said, Antoun acknowledged that if you have common conditions associated with overweight and obesity such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, you should not use FMD without a doctor's approval. The product also should not be used by children under 18 or pregnant or nursing women. And it's not for you if you have certain metabolic diseases, liver or kidney disorders that may be affected by the very low glucose and protein content of the diet, or if you have nut or soy allergies. What's more, it \"should never be combined with glucose-lowering drugs, such as metformin or insulin,\" according to Antoun.

Swiss pharmaceuticals titan Novartis AG(Basel) will get a new chief executive in 2018--Dr. Vasant Narasimhan--after Joseph Jimenez announced his upcoming retirement effective in February. Jimenez has been CEO since 2010, although he has been with the company for a decade. He will step down at the end of January and remain available for advice until his official retirement at the end of August 2018. He will then return home to Silicon Valley, according to Fortune. Narasimhan, who is currently Novartis's global head of drug development and chief medical officer, has been with the company since 2005 and is already on its executive committee. </p><p>Unlike Jimenez, who started his career in consumer goods, Narasimhan is a physician. \"During his tenure, Joe focused Novartison leading global businesses, while divesting non-core divisions,\" Novartischairman Joerg Reinhardt said in a statement, referring to Jimenez's decision to offload the company's animal health business to Eli Lilly .... (Indianapolis IN) and its vaccines and over-the-counter drugs businesses (the latter through the formation of a joint venture) to GlaxoSmithKline PLC(London). The news comes days after Novartisscored approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Kymriah, a form of gene therapy that treats leukemia by training the patient's immune cells to target the blood cancer. A course of the treatment costs $475,000, although Novartisdoesn't get reimbursed unless the patient responds to the treatment within a month. Along with the introduction of other new drugs such as psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, Novartisis hoping that Kymriah will help turn things around after the patent protections expired for its Gleevec cancer drug and Gilenya multiple sclerosis treatment, opening the door to cheaper generics. Op-Ed: Novartis's Sept. 4 announcement of the impending retirement of CEO Joe Jimenez struck many of us as timed to the best news the company had received in his eight-year tenure, viz., the surprise early approval the week prior of Kymriah, its groundbreaking CAR-T treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Jimenez said during a conference call with reporters after the announcement that the FDA go-ahead didn't come into play in his decision to leave--but it does give his successor, Vas Narasimhan, the opportunity to turn CAR-T into a \"big and important business for the company,\" he said. During the call, Narasimhan, who currently serves as Novartis's head of drug development, said it's too early to make any firm predictions about what the next phase of the Swiss company's evolution will look like, saying only that his goal is to \"continue to drive that innovation agenda.\" Perhaps, but FiercePharma says Narasimhan's efforts to advance that agenda will be accompanied by the need to deal with the many challenges he's inheriting from Jimenez. Narasimhan's ascent will likely bring about a completely new management style. Jimenez was a new arrival, joining Novartisfrom HJ Heinz. Narasimhan, by contrast, is both a doctor and a specialist in public health who worked at the Rockefeller Foundation bringing advanced medical treatments to developing countries. Appointing him to the CEO post \"suggests the company is going to really focus on the drug and innovation part of the business,\" said Bartjan van Hulten, founder of London-based health investment firm Medex Capital, in an interview with Bloomberg. Topping the list of Narasimhan's hurdles is Novartis's eye unit Alcon, which has struggled ever since the company shelled out over $39 billion to acquire it in 2010. Novartisis also facing pricing opposition in both its generics and branded businesses. The big question now is how Narasimhan will change things in R...ow that he's behind the wheel. It all adds up to a big leadership task for Narasimhan, whose background as a Harvard-trained physician is entirely different from that of Jimenez, a consumer-products veteran. As a specialist, innovator and trusted, proven insider, he's got all the right stuff for this challenging post.* * * Germany's Merck puts consumer drugs business up for sale; does this signal a last-ditch shot at M...r just shoring up existing pipeline? Merck KGaA (Darmstadt DEU) put its consumer-health unit on the block last week in a move that will focus its healthcare activities on the riskier business of developing prescription medicines, the company said. A final decision hasn't been made. The move is a bet on Merck's growing pipeline of prescription drugs for diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis. Merck has struggled to launch lucrative new drugs in recent years, though it has confidence in its current development pipeline, forecasting new drugs could generate more than EUR2 billion ($2.38 billion) in yearly revenue by 2022, according to MorningStar. \"We have continued to transform Merck...over the last years into a leading science and technology company,\" CEO Stefan Oschmann said in a statement. Merck's consumer-health unit manufactures over-the-counter drugs and generated sales of EUR 860 million in 2016 from a portfolio of 10 core brands that serve more than 40 markets. Citi analyst Peter Verdult estimated it could fetch a price of EUR 1.8 billion to EUR 2.7 billion from a full sale. Drugmakers face pressure to scale up consumer-health businesses amid a wave of consolidation in the segment. In 2015, GlaxoSmithKline PLC(London) and Novartis AG(Basel CHE) combined their consumer-health businesses into a Glaxo-controlled joint venture. France's Sanofi SA gobbled up Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH's consumer-health unit last year. Bel\u0192n Garijo, who heads GR-Merck's healthcare business, said in the statement that the company lacked the financial firepower to build its growing consumer health unit to the \"required scale.\" For companies like Glaxo and Sanofi, reliable revenues from big consumer-health businesses help smooth out the more unpredictable sales of prescription drugs, which succeed or fail on the outcomes of costly and risky clinical trials and whose sales drop sharply after patent expiration. A sale of the consumer-health unit would focus Merck's healthcare arm purely on prescription meds. Earlier this year, Merck sold its biosimilars business--which developed generic versions of biologically made drugs--to Fresenius SE (Bad Homburg) in a deal worth up to EUR670 million. \"We view this as a sensible capital-allocation decision, reflecting both increasing confidence in the pharma pipeline and prioritization of investment elsewhere across group,\" said Citi's Verdult in a note to clients. Merck said proceeds from any transaction would be used to help meet its financial targets. It's the right move, says Max Nisen for Bloomberg. The company is already playing an expensive brand of catch-up in one of the hottest cancer-drug markets out there and in pharma generally. It can't afford to play the same game with its relatively tiny consumer health business. Raising cash and beginning to de-conglomerate is the way to go, Nisen adds. Merck shares closed the week up 4% at 95.47 euros in Frankfurt. The company isn't affiliated with US-based Merck .... (Kenilworth NJ).* * * Lilly to cut 3,500 jobs, take a $12-billion hit to reap $500 million in savings. Eli Lilly .... (Indianapolis IN)) said Thursday it would lay off about 8% of its employees as the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks over the past year in the development of two potential blockbuster drugs, works to cut costs. Lilly will cut about 3,500 positions around the world, resulting in yearly savings of about $500 million, beginning in 2018. The company expects most of the cuts to come from a voluntary early-retirement program it is offering in the US. It is also closing a plant in Iowa and research and development offices in New Jersey and China. Lilly's operating margins have lagged those of the company's rivals, according to Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. \"Lilly's R...s a percentage of sales has trended a bit high over the last couple of years,\" Conover said. \"Part of this is to try to get its operating margins more in alignment with the overall group.\" Lilly expects charges of about $1.2 billion before tax, or $0.80 per share after tax. Lilly outlined in July a likely multi-year delay for its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, after the US Food and Drug Administration declined to approve the drug, calling for an additional clinical study, according to Reuters. That delay followed the failure of a trial in November of Lilly's experimental Alzheimer's treatment solanezumab, which the company had hoped would be the first medicine approved to slow progression of the disease. The company said it has the potential to launch two new medicines by the end of 2018--a breast-cancer drug and a treatment for migraines. The FDA is currently reviewing abemaciclib to treat advanced breast cancer. Lilly shares closed the week up 4% at $82.92.* * * Medical Stock Spotlight: Insmed Inc. (Nasdaq:INSM) led advancing issues, more than doubling (+144%) over the week, to $30.04 after the company announced that its new drug, an inhaled antibiotic known as Alis, successfully treated patients with a rare lung disease. Alis met the main goal in a late-stage study involving 336 adult patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infections. According to Bridgewater, NJ-based Insmed, the addition of the drug showed statistically significant reduction in bacterial density by month six in 29% of patients, compared to just 9% in patients receiving the standard treatment. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infections are caused by a specific type of bacteria found in soil and water, which causes cough, fever and blood in the mucus. As of right now, there is no approved treatment for these types of infections. Based on the latest data, Insmed now plans to apply for accelerated approval for Alis. Elsewhere, NewLink Genetics Corp. (Nasdaq:NLNK) also more than doubled (+127%) after updating data from its ongoing phase 2 trial of IDO inhibitor indoximod in advanced melanoma. Ames, IA-based NewLink Genetics' rally made up all the ground shares had lost earlier this summer when indoximod failed in a mid-stage breast cancer trial and former collaborator Roche Holding AG jumped ship on GDC-0919, a second-generation IDO inhibitor that put up lackluster efficacy data in trials. The trial was evaluating indoximod plus the popular PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in patients with advanced melanoma. The new data shows an improvement in the percentage of patients receiving the two-drug combination who had a complete response versus what was reported in April. Specifically, the complete response rate increased to 20% from 12% previously. The overall response rate also improved to 61% from 59%. Kura Oncology Inc. (Nasdaq:KURA) soared 66% to $11.80 after the biopharmaceutical company announced positive results from a Phase 2 study of its cancer treatment. The company said late Thursday that its lead product candidate, tipifarnib, for the treatment of HRAS mutant relapsed or refractory squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) achieved its primary endpoint. \"We have observed rapid and, in some cases, dramatic responses in patients with relapsed and/or refractory HNSCC who do not appear to benefit from other therapies,\" said Chief Medical Officer Antonio Gualberto. \"Based on these very encouraging results, we are exploring available options to advance the development of tipifarnib in this patient population as quickly as possible.\" La Jolla, CA-based Kura's stock had tumbled 18% over the past three months, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotech had soared 14%. And clinical-stage biopharma Voyager Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:VYGR) shot up 46% to $14.59 after the company announced positive results for a Phase 1b trial investigating the potential of its lead drug candidate to treat advanced Parkinson's disease. The early-stage gene therapy, VY-AADC01, demonstrated dose-dependent responses for several metrics including measures of daily activities, Parkinson's disease rating scales, and patient diaries. Management of Cambridge, MA-based Voyager noted that the results will allow the company to initiate a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial later this year and to dose the first patient in the first half of 2018. Investors should be cautioned that neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease are notoriously complex and difficult to treat. But French cell-therapy specialist Cellectis SA (Nasdaq:CLLS) tumbled 16% to $27.07. The company, which is developing a gene-modified cancer treatment like Novartis AG's recently approved Kymriah, has been forced by the US Food and Drug Administration to suspend testing following a patient death. Cellectis said last Tuesday it was working closely with the FDA to resume trials with a lower dose of the medicine UCART123. The hold was on two early-stage trials of the medicine in blood cancers. Novartismade history the week prior when it won approval for its $475,000 drug Kymriah, the first in a new class of treatments called CAR-T immunotherapies that use modified disease-fighting T cells to attack cancer. UCART19 has already rescued two babies treated at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital from previously incurable cancer.* * * Merck piles up the buoyant Keytruda/chemo findings in lung cancer. Giving Merck ....'s (Kenilworth NJ) immunotherapy drug Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer appears to provide durable benefits, according to an update of a closely watched clinical trial. US regulators approved the drug cocktail in May but the limited clinical trial data to date means that questions remain as to whether it will retain its effectiveness over time. On the other hand, the significant improvements first reported a year ago have been maintained for more than 18 months, with the risk of disease progression or death reduced by nearly half, researchers at the European Society for Medical OncologyCongress reported on Friday. People in the 123-patient trial who got Keytruda plus chemotherapy survived 19 months on average before their disease worsened, against 8.9 months for those on chemo alone, data from a scientific abstract at the meeting showed. The overall survival rate was 70% for the combination compared with 56% for chemo on its own, according to Reuters. Merck senior vice president Roger Dansey said the latest data confirmed the combination had \"the potential to have a meaningful impact in the lives of many of these patients.\" Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market and rival drugmakers are racing to find new combinations based on immunotherapy drugs, which boost the immune system's ability to fight tumors. Chemotherapy, despite its toxic side effects, has for many years been the standard treatment for the disease. Merck's small trial was the first proof of the advantages of using chemotherapy and immunotherapy together in lung cancer and the US drugmaker is now awaiting more conclusive data from a bigger study. Its Swiss rival Roche Holding AG (Basel) is also investigating a different immunotherapy and chemotherapy mix. Competing companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYC) and AstraZeneca PLC (London) have focused on combining two immunotherapies. However, AstraZeneca's endeavors suffered a huge setback in July when a large combination drug trial failed to help lung-cancer patients as hoped. Drugs like Keytruda and rival products from other companies work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors. Tens of billions of dollars of these drugs are expected to sell in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, the largest potential market.* * * Tracking Washington: Almost eight months after President Donald Trump took office and promised to immediately repeal Obamacare, Republican senators are instead developing a small package of changes to help the health law rather than scrap it. Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican taking the lead on some of the efforts, said he wants an Obamacare package to include money for insurers to defray low-income Americans' health costs, as well as flexibility for states to decide how they cover their citizens under the law. \"This hearing is about taking one small step, a small step on a big issue which has been locked in partisan stalemate for seven years,\" Alexander said last Wednesday at a hearing by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which he is chairman. The new, more modest plan is a sharp change of direction after Republicans' efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed earlier this summer, according to Bloomberg. In another shift, GOP and Democratic lawmakers have pledged to work together on the changes and appeared during the hearing to be prepared to iron out any differences. Alexander said that members of both parties will have to agree to proposals they might not be comfortable with. \"Democrats will have to agree to something--more flexibility for states--that some are reluctant to support. And Republicans will have to agree to something--additional funding through the Affordable Care Act--that some are reluctant to support,\" he said. The Senate just returned from its summer break and is convening a series of hearings on the ACA, and Alexander said his hope is to pass a bill by the end of the month. Separately, a last-ditch GOP effort to move an ACA replacement bill forward gained a major boost Wednesday when Sen. John McCain, one of three Republican votes against repealing Obamacare in July, told reporters he supports the measure proposed by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. The repeal proposal, which focuses on doling out Obamacare funding to states to use as they see fit, faces a deadline on Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. MondayMorning/September 11, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 33 CORPORATE Bristol-Myers halts kidney-cancer drug tests after early success. The outlook brightened last week for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s (NYC) Opdivo as a combo med with the drugmaker releasing more results from a test of its Opdivo-plus-Yervoy combination as a first-line treatment in kidney cancer. The overall survival results were promising enough that Bristol-Myers ended the trial early. The report, according to FiercePharma, led one analyst to predict \"a very high likelihood of approval\" as a first-line treatment in renal cell carcinoma. It is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults and an area in which some forecasters think that Opdivo could eventually derive $2 billion in annual sales. The data were from a trial of Opdivo along with Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Bristol-Myers said the combo met the co-primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy with Pfizer Inc.'s (NYC) Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The combination also met a secondary endpoint of improved OS versus Sutent in all randomized patients. The presentation followed an early glimpse at data last month that had raised questions about the viability of the combo approach in kidney cancer. The mixed results from that report showed that the combo hit its response-rate endpoint at 41.6%, compared with 26.5% for Pfizer's Sutent, but narrowly missed its goal of showing the pair could fend off cancer growth better than Sutent. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez told clients he saw today's report as a positive rebound from the mixed initial progression-free survival (PFS) numbers. Leerink researchers believe the overall survival results likely confirm \"the durability of the signal seen on PFS,\" which is why Fernandez thinks the combo will get an FDA approval, one that he says is \"critically important\" for growth in Bristol-Myers' shares. Opdivo is already approved to treat kidney cancer in patients who've failed after one round of treatment, and that population accounted for 15% to 20% of the drug's $768 million in second-quarter sales. BMS shares closed the week up 5% at $62.62.* * * Senator's report verifies fraud by former employees of embattled Insys. Insys Therapeutics Inc. (ChandlerAZ) sought to manipulate insurance payment approval for an opioid cancer pain drug called Subsys even if for inappropriate uses, according to a US Senate report on the opioid crisis released last Wednesday. The report, released by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, said those efforts led to an Insys employee making misleading statements to get insurance to cover a prescription for a woman who according to a lawsuit died after taking Subsys. The report was the first by McCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to flow out of her investigation into drugmakers' roles in the national opioid addiction epidemic. The report came amid a series of federal and state investigations centered on the marketing of Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl. Fentanyl is a man-made opioid that is 100 times more powerful than morphine. In December, federal prosecutors in Boston charged six former Insys executives and managers, including former CEO Michael Babich, with engaging in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys. They have pleaded not guilty. McCaskill's report said that Insys lacked measures to prevent employees from manipulating the process insurers and pharmacy benefit managers use to deter over-prescription by requiring pre-approval of medicines. The report noted that in June, Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Insys, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud insurers into paying for Subsys. Insys shares closed the week off 11 cents at $9.11.* * * Health stocks soar going into fall season; well, not everyone. Here's my take on three big movers: Abeona, UroGen and Otonomy. Since mid-August, Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:ABEO) has skyrocketed 87% to $13.85 at close Friday. That huge gain resulted primarily from the US Food and Drug Administration granting \"breakthrough therapy\" designation for the biotech's EB-101 gene-therapy program for treating patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. This rare genetic disease causes the skin to blister easily and can lead to serious medical problems. Breakthrough therapy designation is certainly good news, since it can speed up the drug development and approval process. The designation is especially helpful to Dallas, TX-based Abeona right now, as the company is working with the FDA to finalize the design of a Phase 3 study of EB-101. Abeona hopes to begin that study in early 2018. The 5 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Abeona have a median target of $20.00, with a high estimate of $21.00 and a low estimate of $17.00. The median estimate represents a 44% increase from the last price of $13.85. Despite its massive gains last week, Abeona has a relatively low market cap of $556 million. The company isn't tightly linked to a larger biopharma company yet, either. That could definitely make it more appealing to the big boys that don't have a strong gene-therapy focus yet. Elsewhere, UroGen Pharma Ltd. (Nasdaq:URGN) has rocketed 51% since mid-August to $27.85. The Israeli clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology, announced that the FDA has granted \"fast track\" designation for the company's lead product candidate. MitoGel is being developed and tested for the treatment of patients with low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) not amendable to endoscopic resection or with contraindication to nephroureterectomy (removal of kidney and upper tract), including impaired renal function. UTUC refers to cancer of the upper tract, which connects the bladder to the kidney, and the renal pelvis. No drugs are currently FDA-approved for the treatment of UTUC and analysts remain bullish. As of Sept. 1, 2017, the consensus forecast among 4 polled analysts covering UroGen advises investors to Buy equity in the company. The analysts offering 12-month price targets for UroGen have a median target of $29.50, with a high estimate of $32.00 and a low estimate of $27.00. The median estimate represents a 6% increase from the last price of $27.85. There's no question that UroGen's MitoGel has serious upside potential. But there are so many instances of a med's unexpected failure in Phase 3 testing, some positive clinical data would help support a Buy argument. But hitting the skids, Otonomy Inc. (Nasdaq:OTIC) has plunged 81% to $3.60 after saying it suspended developing its drug for Meniere's disease, a chronic disorder of the inner ear, after it failed a late-stage trial. Meniere's typically affects one ear, causing vertigo, a persistent ringing in the ear, and ultimately, permanent loss of hearing. The disease affects about 600,000 Americans. The FDA has so far not approved any specific drug for Meniere's. San Diego-based Otonomy's drug, Otividex, is a formulation of an existing steroid designed to become a viscous gel upon injection, allowing for a quicker, five-minute procedure. Otividex missed the trial's main goal of significantly reducing the number and severity of vertigo episodes over a three-month period when compared with a placebo. As of Sept. 1, 2017, the consensus forecast among 6 polled analysts covering Otonomy advises that the company will Outperform the market. This has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment improved on Aug. 10, 2015. The previous consensus forecast advised investors to Hold their position in Otonomy. The 4 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Otonomy have a median target of $12.00, with a high estimate of $28.00 and a low estimate of $8.00. The median estimate represents a 333% increase from the last price of $3.60. Investment in experimental drugs for hearing loss, long an untapped field in the pharmaceutical industry, may be picking up, but drugs that actually help with these disorders remain elusive. Due to the massive upside forecast by analysts, once the company unveils its next strategic steps, buying this flogged name could make sense.MERCK .... (Kenilworth NJ) has agreed to acquire Rigontec GmbH (Munich) for up to 464 million (about $554 million), in a deal that will expand the cancer immunotherapy franchise of the Keytruda (pembrolizumab) developer with a three-year-old Bonn University spinout whose technology targets the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway. According to Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News, Rigontec says its proprietary agonists are designed to activate RIG-I in order to induce both immediate and long-term antitumor immunity. The technology, Rigontec says, can be used for developing bifunctional RNA molecules for the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer. The German company's lead candidate, RGT100, is now in Phase 1 development evaluating treatment in patients with various tumors. In May, the company dosed its first patient in a Phase 1/2 study in which RGT100 will be administered intra-tumorally and intra-lesionally in solid tumors and lymphoma, according to GEN News. The development of RGT100 is being overseen by CMO Eugen Leo, MD, PhD, MBA, who was appointed in May. \"Rigontec's immuno-oncology approach of engaging the innate immune system to safely eliminate cancer cells complements our strategy and our current pipeline,\" Eric Rubin, MD, VP of clinical oncology at Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement. \"We are eager to build upon Rigontec's science as we continue our efforts in bringing forward meaningful advances for patients with cancer.\" Merck has agreed to pay 115 million ($137 million) in up-front cash and up to 349 million ($416 million) in payments tied to achieving clinical, development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. The deal is subject to closing conditions, Merck said.ALNYLAM PHARMACEUTICALS INC. (Cambridge MA) has been thumped by another round of safety fears, forced to suspend all treatment with fitusiran after a patient died from a blood clot in a Phase 2 hemophilia A study. Company personnel plan to resume dosing as soon as possible, but have been staggered by deaths that recently crushed a top program at the RNAi group. New safety questions about a key late-stage drug like this is the last thing that Alnylam wants to wrestle with now, according to John Carroll for Endpoints. Alnylam will now put plans to start the Phase 3 ATLAS study on hold until this is resolved, with the ongoing Phase 2 OLE study sidelined for now. Shares of the biotech closed the week down 17% at $73.69. It's unclear how much damage this development will cause. As Paul Matteis at Leerink noted, \"blood clotting has been a concern for some time among the thought leaders in the field. And even if Alnylam gets past this hurdle, an incident like this could cripple market expectations. While we look to more color regarding ALNY's preliminary plans on the company's call this morning, our initial reaction is that even if the dosing and late-stage programs are resumed for fitusiran, the commercial opportunity may now be limited given the risk-averse nature of the hemophilia patient population (especially patients without inhibitors).\" The incident began when a patient complained of exercise-induced hip pain followed by a severe headache. He was diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basis of CT imaging and treated with factor VIII concentrate administered two to three times daily. Fourteen days after he was admitted to the hospital, he died from cerebral edema. And the cause of death was determined to be cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, hitting a sinus which drains blood from the brain, not a subarachnoid hemorrhage--triggering the fear that the clot was triggered by the therapy. The setback occurs just 10 months after Sanofi agreed to pay $100 million to opt in on the Phase 3 fitusiran study after partnering with Alnylam in a $700 million buy-in back in 2014. Two months ago, the partners reported encouraging data from the Phase 2 trial.GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC. (London) said it has licensed the rights to Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC's pioneering T-cell therapy program to boost its pipeline in oncology, one of four areas it has prioritized for research and development. T-cell therapy is part of a new approach to treating cancer that harnesses the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. Glaxo's new CEO Emma Walmsley said in July she would in the future allocate 80% of the company's R...udget to respiratory, HIV/infectious disease, immuno-inflammation and oncology. The company said it would pay Adaptimmune up to 48 million pounds ($63 million) for the global license for the T-cell receptor therapy targeting the NY-ESO peptide, which is present across many cancer types. It is being used in studies to treat six types of cancer, including a rare form of soft tissue cancer, as well as in a combination study in multiple myeloma. GSK's head of oncology Axel Hoos said the company had seen compelling data for the NY-ESO investigational cell therapy in synovial sarcoma, which usually develops in cells around joints and tendons, and it will capitalize on its in-house cell and gene therapy capabilities to support its development. \"We will continue to explore the potential for this novel cell therapy in multiple tumor types, and in combination with other cancer therapies,\" he said. Shares in Adaptimmune, which is based in Oxfordshire, southern England but listed in New York, closed the week up 36% at $8.93. Glaxo slipped 3% to 1,494 pence in London.ROCHE HOLDING AG. (Basel CHE) said patients taking its targeted lung cancer drug Alecensa have a far lower risk of their disease spreading in the brain than those on Pfizer Inc.'s (NYC) Xalkori, according to new clinical trial data. The results, presented at the Sept. 8-12 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in Madrid, reinforce Alecensa's position in an increasingly competitive market, according to Reuters. Alecensa is designed to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, which is found in about 4% of all people with NSCLC. Clinical results in June had already shown Alecensa worked better than Xalkori. The new data add to evidence of its benefits, with Roche's drug shown to control existing brain metastases and inhibit the formation of new ones. Among patients who had existing metastases in the central nervous system (CNS), Alecensa reduced the risk of disease progression in the CNS by 60% compared with Xalkori, according to a new clinical trial subgroup analysis. In patients without CNS disease at the start of testing, Alecensa reduced the risk of disease progression in the CNS by 49%. A second study showed an 85% reduction in risk of disease worsening or death versus chemotherapy in patients who had previously seen their disease worsen on chemotherapy and Xalkori. \"There are other drugs out there but so far it looks really good for Alecensa,\" said Thomas Buechele, Roche's head of global medical affairs for oncology. Doctors may now decide it makes sense to use the latest generation of drugs as first-line treatment rather than starting with older therapies.FDA/EMA ROUNDUP: The US Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer Inc. 's (NYC) Mylotarg (gemtuzumab apogamic) for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia expressing the CD33 antigen. The agency also approved Mylotarg for the treatment of patients age 2 and older with CD33-positive AML who have experienced a relapse or not responded to initial treatment. After receiving accelerated approval in 2000, Pfizer withdrew Mylotarg from the market in 2010, after trials failed to verify clinical benefit and demonstrated safety concerns, including deaths. The new approval includes a lower dose and different schedule, both in combination with chemotherapy and alone, as well as a new patient population. Elsewhere, endoscopic cryo-ablation company CSA Medical Inc. (Lexington MA) won expanded 510(k) clearance for its TruFreeze spray cryotherapy system. (A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval.) The system is now cleared for use on patients with Barrett's esophagus with low grade dysplasia. The device was previously approved for high grade dysplasia as well as malignancies, the Boston-based company said. The TruFreeze system is designed for use in dermatology, gynecology, general surgery, and to ablate benign and malignant lesions. Sanofi SA (Paris) won tentative FDA approval for a biosimilar to Eli Lilly ....'s Humalog, putting billions in insulin sales at risk for the Indiana-based drugmaker. Sanofi won provisional approval for its biosim Admelog on Sept. 1, according to an FDA letter. Also, a top player in diabetes, the French drugmaker now has 45 days to notify Lilly of the news, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson wrote in a note to clients. Humalog was Eli Lilly's top seller last year, bringing in $2.76 billion around the world. Humalog itself is out of patent protections, but Lilly could win up to 2.5 years of additional exclusivity if it chooses to sue for infringement on its remaining patent covering the KwikPen injection device, the analyst noted. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Tarrytown NY) and partner Sanofi SA (Paris) won breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for their newly named cemiplimab (REGN2810). Regulators handed out the label in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and adults with locally advanced and unresectable CSCC, the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. In an early-stage cohort with only 26 patients, the experimental PD-1 drug was associated with a 46% overall response rate and a 69% disease control rate. The FDA stopped five blood-cancer trials testing AstraZeneca PLC's (London) immunotherapy Imfinzi in combination with Celgene Corp. (Summit NJ) medicines from accepting new patients and halted another study entirely, the companies said on Thursday. The agency's decisions stem from safety concerns uncovered in similar blood cancer trials of Merck ....'s (Kenilworth NJ) rival Keytruda medicine in combination with widely used multiple myeloma drugs that Celgene sells. The news follows Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s (NYC) announcement on Wednesday that the FDA had placed similar partial clinical holds on three trials of the company's Opdivo immunotherapy in combination with multiple myeloma treatments. The FDA placed a hold on three Merck multiple myeloma combination trials in July after safety monitors reported more deaths among patients who received Keytruda than those in the control group. The FDA accused the Pfizer Inc. (NYC) of failing to properly investigate reports of malfunctioning EpiPens, including incidents when patients died or became severely ill after the device failed to work. Pfizer manufactures the EpiPen, which treats allergic reactions, for the drugmaker Mylan NV (Amsterdam). In a warning letter issued last Tuesday, the agency said Meridian Medical Technologies, which is a unit of Pfizer, did not adequately look into problems with a crucial component of the EpiPen--the mechanism on the device that insures that it fires and delivers the proper dose of epinephrine, which stops an allergic reaction. The FDA said the company failed to conduct a proper investigation even though it received numerous complaints about problems with activating the device. And the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has stuck to its decision not to recommend Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.'s (Osaka) multiple myeloma therapy Ninlaro for routine use in the NHS in England and Wales after a consultation process. The agency reiterated its position that Ninlaro (ixazomib) is not cost-effective as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and that Takeda had not been able to persuade it that the drug extended life in these patients compared to current treatments. NICE initially rejected the drug in draft guidance published in April, and has issued a second negative appraisal consultation document (ACD) for the drug that also says Ninlaro doesn't meet the criteria for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), the fallback option for drugs not available on the NHS. MondayMorning/September 11, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 33 Weekly Stock Performance (as of September 8, 2017)MondayMorning/September 11, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 33WALL ST./FINANCE The S...00 ended slightly lower on Friday as investors braced for potential damage from Hurricane Irma as it drove toward Florida, while a decline in big tech names like Apple and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq down more sharply. The Dow eked out a gain, helped by a 4.0% rise in shares of insurer Travelers. Insurer shares rose broadly, with the Dow Jones US Insurance Index up 2.1%, recouping some losses after being under pressure recently as the southern US braced for another powerful storm closely on the heels of Hurricane Harvey. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, lashed Cuba and the Bahamas as it drove toward Florida, while US officials were preparing a massive response to the storm. \"Investors are really in a wait-and-see mode given their concern about the impact of Hurricane Irma on Florida and wherever else it ends up going,\" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Energy shares fell 1.1% as oil prices dropped on worries that commerce and energy demand in Florida and the Southeast would be hit hard due to Irma. Geopolitical concerns kept investors on edge as South Korea prepared for a possible further missile test by North Korea on Saturday, days after its sixth and largest nuclear test. \"It's a confluence of concerns that have been hovering over the market, everything from North Korea...and obviously the hurricane and the damage that will ensue,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, NJ. Despite those macro concerns, the benchmark S...00 still is within about 1% of its all-time closing high as investors point to strong corporate earnings and solid economic data as supporting stocks. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, which tracks implied volatility and is considered the Street's fear gauge known as the VIX, was up a whopping 20% over the week to 12.12. For the week, the S...00 slipped 15.12, or 0.61%, to 2,461.43. The Dow tumbled 189.77, or 0.86%, to 21,797.79.

Researchers examined data on more than 61,000 women in the California Teachers Study who reported their exercise habits at two points in time, once from 1995 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. The women were current and retired teachers when the study began. Overall, 987 women had a stroke by the end of the study period. But the women who got at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise at both points in time were 30% less likely to have what's known as an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, which occurs when a clot blocks an artery carrying blood to the brain. \"How people exercise changes over time and some individuals exercise when they are a young adult but do not keep it up when they are older,\" said lead study author Dr. Joshua Willey of Columbia University Medical Center in New York. \"In our study, we found that maintaining exercise levels was protective against stroke, and that taking up exercise when not being active while younger was also protective,\" Willey said. \"Similarly, those who no longer exercised on the follow up assessment did not have a lower risk of stroke.\" The American Heart Association recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous physical activity. (SOURCE: Stroke, online August 9, 2017.)Some stroke patients may have undiagnosed cancer that is contributing to their risk for cerebrovascular events by inducing a state of hypercoagulability, the results of a Spanish observational study suggest. The incidence of cancer among stroke survivors was almost twice the rate that would be expected in the general population and was associated with increased serum fibrinogen levels. \"When cancer was diagnosed, it was usually at an advanced stage, and the diagnosis was made within 6 months after a stroke,\" lead researcher, Jacobo Rogado, MD, medical oncology fellow, Hospital de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain, said in a statement. \"This indicates that the cancer was already present when the stroke occurred but there were no symptoms,\" he added. \"Stroke survivors should be followed clinically for the development of cancer in the 18 months after the diagnosis of stroke. This applies particularly to older patients who had cancer previously, or who have high fibrinogen or low levels of hemoglobin,\" he said. The study was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2017 Congress on September 10. Commenting for ESMO, Fausto Roila, MD, director of medical oncology, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, Perugia, Italy, sounded a note of caution over interpreting the results. While the potential association between stroke and cancer \"is an interesting issue,\" he said, the current results are hampered by the lack of a matched control group. \"A case-control study would have been more suitable,\" he said in a statement. Dr. Roila also pointed out that the difference in absolute numbers between incident cancer cases and that expected in the general population is only 12, \"and this could be due to differences in age between the two groups.\" He said, \"The general population includes people of all ages, while the case population (patients with stroke) is primarily older patients. Therefore, further studies are needed before a firm association can be established between stroke and cancer.\"A new blood test from Roche Holding AG (Basel CHE) and Foundation Medicine Inc (Cambridge MA) has shown it can accurately measure the number of mutations within a tumor, potentially helping to predict which patients may respond best to some immunotherapies. Initial data on Roche's test aimed at determining tumor mutational burden, or TMB, were released on Friday at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Madrid, according to Reuters. Immunotherapies such as Roche's Tecentriq, Merck ....'s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Opdivo have offered fresh hope to people with deadly cancers, but they only work in a fraction of patients. And given immunotherapies' high costs and possible serious side effects, with British regulators having dubbed Tecentriq too expensive, doctors want better ways to identify which patients would benefit the most from such treatments. Evidence shows that tumors with more mutations are more likely to respond to immunotherapy, Roche said, adding that it hopes the new test will improve measuring TMB, particularly when invasive biopsies are not feasible. There are no such blood tests on the market now, it said. \"Biomarkers will not only improve our understanding of immune biology but will ultimately help match our therapies and combinations to the people most likely to benefit,\" said Sandra Horning, MD, the Swiss drugmaker's chief medical officer. Roche's trials for Tecentriq showed that lung and bladder cancer patients responded best in instances where their tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1, a protein that helps tumors evade immune attack. Roche, which owns 58% of Foundation, is developing 20 cancer immunotherapy medicines across nine types of cancer, including in combination with other drugs.Eating a small bar of dark chocolate containing olive oil every day may improve endothelial function, a small, randomized crossover study suggests. Results showed that when 26 middle-aged adults with at least three cardiovascular risk factors ate a 40-g bar of dark chocolate enriched with extra virgin olive oil every day for a month, their levels of endothelial progenitor cells--important for vascular repair and reduced in people with cardiovascular risk factors--improved. \"These results, in our opinion, can motivate people to be more indulgent in a small piece of dark chocolate daily, which has at least 70% cocoa, and which may help longevity,\" Dr. Rossella Di Stefano (University of Pisa, Italy) told a press conference here at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2017 Congress. The same beneficial effects were not seen when the study participants ate dark chocolate that had been enriched with red apple, although the authors speculate this may have been because the concentration of added apple was insufficient. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown that endothelial progenitor cells \"can repair endothelium and are lowered by cardiovascular risk factors,\" Di Stefano told Medscape Cardiology. \"We can improve this with statins, for example, but we can also improve this with chocolate.\" The study participants found that the olive-oil\u20ac\"enriched chocolate tasted good, and there are some versions that are commercially available. \"The idea is very interesting,\" but this is a preliminary study, session co\u20ac\"chair Dr. Joep Perk (Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden), who was not involved with this research, said. \"This is the first step,\" he cautioned. \"We'll need a much longer observation period and much larger groups of patients\" before widely recommending this. \"But it is a door opener, and I hope people will go through that door.\" MondayMorning/September 11, 2017/Vol. 25/No. 33NEWS BRIEFS  One of the nation's most prestigious prizes in medicine will go to Planned Parenthood and two scientists who played a crucial role in developing the vaccine to combat HPV, a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cervical cancer. A third honor will go to a Swiss molecular biologist, who made a groundbreaking discovery about cell growth. The Lasker Awards, sometimes called the \"American Nobels\" because 85 of the awardees have gone on to win the international honor, were announced by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation last Wednesday. Each prize comes with $250,000, according to The New York Times. The citation for the Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award credits Planned Parenthood \"for providing essential health services and reproductive care to millions of women for more than a century\" and for helping \"men as well.\" The award takes the Laskers, usually known for honoring groundbreaking scientific advances and humanitarian efforts, into more political territory. Planned Parenthood is facing escalating threats from President Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress to bar the organization from receiving federal funds, a move that could force the closure of clinics across the country. \"We are thrilled to be honored,\" Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Foundation of America, said in a statement. \"Planned Parenthood has substantially improved health outcomes for women--and we will keep fighting for our patients, no matter what.\" Dr. Douglas R. Lowy and Dr. John T. Schiller received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for technological advances that enabled the development of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, such as Gardasil, which are typically given to adolescents before they are sexually active. The award is a high-profile endorsement of the vaccine, which has been adopted at lower rates in the US than other childhood vaccines. The possibility for impact, many believe, is highest in the developing world where cervical cancer continues to be a primary killer and the possibility of catching HPV early through a Pap smear--as often happens countries with more advanced healthcare systems--is unlikely. Dr. Michael N. Hall received the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for figuring out that cell growth is controlled by the nutrient-activated TOR protein. This growth regulator plays a role in life span and diseases, including diabetes and cancer, and the breakthrough has been praised for its far-reaching medical implications. \"Cells are the unit of life, but I think they define life,\" said Dr. Hall. The awards will be presented in Manhattan on Friday September 15.A deadline for insurers to file 2018 prices for health insurance sold through Affordable Care Act exchanges arrived last Tuesday, but state regulators are still struggling to make decisions about pricing and coverage amid uncertainty in federal health policy. The upshot is confusion in what is typically an orderly, regimented regulatory process for reviewing insurance offerings that will go on sale to consumers on Nov. 1, says the Wall Street Journal. States are taking different approaches, based on their best guesses about what Congress and President Donald Trump's administration might do regarding the health-law marketplaces, though several state regulators said in interviews that they are leaning toward approving hefty rate increases. According to actuarial firm Milliman Inc., at least 32 states have requested that insurers prepare alternate premiums for different scenarios. Most of those states are still holding off on a final decision on which rates to choose. \"The uncertainty makes it very difficult to navigate, and it's not going away,\" said Eric A. Cioppa, superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance. Insurer Anthem Inc. (Indianapolis IN) has said it would stop offering exchange plans under Obamacare in Maine next year if the federal government stops payments known as cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Those payments, which Mr. Trump, a Republican, has threatened to halt, reimburse insurers for money they advance to reduce healthcare costs for low-income ACA enrollees. A White House spokesman said the president \"is working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by\" these payments. State regulators have until Sept. 20 to complete their reviews and approve rates. Insurers are due to sign final federal contracts to offer plans by Sept. 27. Some insurers said they are moving forward with plans to participate in the 2018 marketplaces but holding off on final decisions until the late-September cutoff.For at least the past 50 years, the rate at which Americans died from stroke has declined. But that remarkable progress has stalled of late, according to a new federal report, and may even be reversing, according to Bloomberg. While stroke has dropped from the third-leading cause of death a decade ago to the fifth in 2013, that good-news story obscures a grimmer prospect: Years of deteriorating health among Americans may be manifesting in more people falling victim to stroke. \"The risk profile in the US has changed, and changed significantly,\" says Quanhe Yang, senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and lead author of the new report. \"This is a wake-up call.\" Strokes are the result of blood clots or hemorrhages that lead to brain damage within minutes. Almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year, and about one-sixth of stroke victims die. Many survive only with serious disability. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. While the rate of high blood pressure, also called hypertension, has recently stabilized, more than half of Americans with hypertension don't have it under control. Obesity and diabetes have increased significantly since the 1980s, with more than one-third of US adults classified as obese. As people develop these conditions at younger ages and live with them for longer periods, the risk that they will have strokes increases. A big portion of the southeastern US has long been considered the \"stroke belt,\" with rates of stroke deaths far higher than the rest of the country. The CDC's latest analysis shows that troubling trends are spreading through a far wider area, to the west and northeastern US. In 16 states, stroke mortality improvement has slowed down--meaning improvements haven't kept up with historical trends. In another 21 states and the District of Columbia, the improvements have stalled entirely or reversed in some cases.High carbohydrate intake is associated with a higher risk of mortality, and high fat intake with a lower risk, researchers report. An international team of scientists studied diet and mortality in 135,335 people between 35 and 70 years old in 18 countries, following them for an average of more than seven years. Diet information depended on self-reports, and the scientists controlled for factors including age, sex, smoking, physical activity and body mass index. The study is in The Lancet. Compared with people who ate the lowest 20% of carbohydrates, those who ate the highest 20% had a 28% increased risk of death. But high carbohydrate intake was not associated with cardiovascular death, The New York Times reports. People with the highest 20% in total fat intake--an average of 35.3% of calories from fat--had about a 23% reduced risk of death compared with the lowest 20% (an average of 10.6% of calories from fat). Consuming higher saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat were all associated with lower mortality. Higher fat diets were also associated with a lower risk of stroke. \"Guidelines recommend low saturated fat, and some recommend really low amounts,\" said a co-author, Andrew Mente, an epidemiologist at McMaster University in Ontario. \"Our study, which captures intake at the lowest levels, shows that this may be harmful.\" Current federal guidelines recommend a diet that provides no more than 35% of calories from fat.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>SECTION 13 Snapshot of 11 Norwegian

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>SECTION 13 Snapshot of 10 Norwegian

In many ways, they're sounding the alarm on their own creations. One former Facebook executive, Tim Kendall, who was asked what worried him most, said: \"In the shortest time horizon, I'm most worried about civil war.\"<br/>Somewhat ironically, social media is awash with people saying they plan to delete their social media accounts after watching the show, with Facebook and Instagram appearing to be called out most frequently.<br/>\"Everyone should watch The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix and then make the necessary changes,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Tonight I deleted Facebook and turned off notifications from Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. It's time to take back control of our minds.\"<br/>Another Twitter user said: \"Just watched this and immediately deleted #Facebook and #Instagram. A must watch to understand the manipulation.\"<br/>Ranked as the 5th most watched show on Netflix in the U.K. on Friday and hailed as \"the most important documentary of our times\" by The Independent newspaper, \"The Social Dilemma\" shines a light on how tech companies influence national elections, \"follow\" billions of people around the internet in order to deliver targeted ads to them and come up with features that drive addiction.<br/>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment when asked whether it was concerned about a potential user backlash.<br/>Instead the California-headquartered firm pointed to several announcements and resources on safety and mental health.</p><p>September 17: Facebook issues new rules on internal employee communication<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday outlined to employees a new set of principles to guide debates and conversations within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Zuckerberg outlined the changes to address \"a lot of very tense conversations happening out in the world,\" according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The new principles follow a set of similar changes at Google, which is increasing the moderation of its internal message boards, CNBC reported earlier this week.<br/>\"We deeply value expression and open discussion. What we've heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,\" Osborne said in a statement. \"We're updating our employee policies and work tools to ensure our culture remains respectful and inclusive.\"<br/>The changes follow a set of recent leaks from Workplace and the company's weekly Q&amp;As showing that employees have increased their criticism of the company's policies.<br/>Under the new set of principles, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will ensure all employees feel supported at work, especially the company's Black community, by strengthening the company's harassment policy with more protections for underrepresented employees.<br/>The company will also be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. This change will be so that employees do not have to confront social issues during their day-to-day work.<br/>Facebook's new principles also ask that employees communicate with professionalism and continue to debate about the company's work but do so in a respectful manner.<br/>BuzzFeed last month reported employees criticized Zuckerberg's explanation of why the company failed to remove a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to plan an event where two protesters were shot and killed.</p><p>September 17: Facebook is cracking down on groups that give health advice and promote violence<br/>Facebook on Thursday announced new policies that will limit the spread of groups on its social network that focus on giving users health advice, as well as groups with ties to violence.<br/>The company will no longer show health groups in its recommendations, saying a blog post that \"it's crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources.\" In the past, closed groups have been used by Facebook users to spread misinformation about vaccines and Covid-19.<br/>Similarly, the company said it will limit the spread of groups tied to violence by removing them from recommendations, restricting them from search and reducing how often their content shows up on people's News Feeds. This move comes as Facebook has struggled to moderate groups, including a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to organize an event where two people were killed in real life.<br/>Facebook said it removed the pages tied to that event after it happened, blaming an \"operational error\" for allowing the event to stay up despite the fact it violated the company's policies. But BuzzFeed later discovered that Facebook did not remove the pages; one of the group's admins did. It was only then that Facebook admitted it never took the event down.<br/>Additionally, Facebook will now archive groups that do not have admins, which are key to moderating groups. If an admin steps down from their role, they can invite other groups members to replace them. Facebook will also suggest this role to active members, but if no one steps up, the company will archive those groups. If Facebook removes a group for policy reasons, administrators and moderators of that group will be unable to create any new groups for a period of time.<br/>Facebook also said that it will prevent the admins and moderators of any groups that it removes for policy violations from creating any new groups \"for a period of time,\" although the company did not specify how long that window lasts.</p><p>September 17: As Main Street crisis worsens, Facebook launches new small business platform<br/>Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.<br/>\"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.<br/>The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.<br/>Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.<br/>This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a Covid hub in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a voter information center.<br/>Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.<br/>At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S.</p><p>September 16: Facebook's latest virtual reality headset is the best yet, but still feels antisocial<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset. It's a successor to last year's Quest and, like that version, doesn't require a computer to run. Everything you need to use VR is bundled inside.<br/>This is the strategy Facebook is taking moving forward. It's ditching the Oculus Rift headset, which required a PC to operate.<br/>You can still run advanced PC virtual reality games designed for the Rift on the Quest 2 using an Oculus Link USB-C cable. Oculus Link was in beta on the original Oculus Quest, but now it's an official feature. This is Facebook's long-term vision: a headset you can use anywhere you want, but that you can still link to a PC to render games that require more powerful hardware.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 16: Facebook teaming up with Ray-Ban maker for first smart glasses in 2021<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced a partnership with Luxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban, to release its first pair of smart glasses in 2021.<br/>\"After spending time with their team and visiting their factory, I knew that they were the right partner for us to help bring the best technology together with the best glasses,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a live stream from Facebook Connect, the company's online event for its virtual and augmented reality products.<br/>Facebook and Luxottica will make the glasses as part of a multiyear partnership. The pairing of the two companies was first reported by CNBC last year.<br/>\"I can't go into full product details yet, but they're really the next step on the road to augmented reality glasses,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And they look pretty good too.\"<br/>Zuckerberg also announced that the company plans to release Project Aria, a research device that the company will use to learn as it develops its consumer smart glasses.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 15: Facebook shares fall as Kim Kardashian West calls for one-day boycott<br/>Celebrities are calling out Facebook for not doing enough to stop disinformation and hate on its platform.

Jordan and Ashton Kutcher have said they will participate in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" on Wednesday as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>A slew of big-name advertisers including Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Verizon paused to their social media budgets this summer after \"Stop Hate For Profit\" called on advertisers to boycott Facebook for the month of July. The goal, the group said, was to pressure the company into taking more stringent steps to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation on its platform.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 15: Facebook<br/>Shares of the group known as \"FAANGM\" rose broadly as tech tried to build on its solid gains from the previous session.

At the time, Facebook said Apple would not make an exception to its rules to give the full amount of the transactions to the businesses hosting the events. Facebook already waived its cut through its Facebook Pay system, and Google agreed not to take its standard 30% cut of the transactions through the Android version of the app.<br/>An Apple spokesperson told CNBC it reversed its decision on the Facebook event fees due to the pressures businesses are facing from the pandemic, and that Apple wants to give those businesses more time to adapt to digital business models. The spokesperson also said its App Store rule that requires the 30% cut to Apple does not apply to ticketing real-world events, only digital events, and Facebook has until the end of the year to implement in-app payments for real-world events. Airbnb and ClassPass also have until the end of the year to add the in-app payments for events, Apple said.<br/>\"The App Store provides a great business opportunity for all developers, who use it to reach half a billion visitors each week across 175 countries,\" Apple said in a statement. \"To ensure every developer can create and grow a successful business, Apple maintains a clear, consistent set of guidelines that apply equally to everyone.\"<br/>Facebook's announcement on Friday also takes a shot at Apple's App Store policies, claiming they're harmful to small businesses struggling amid a pandemic-fueled recession.</p><p>September 24: Facebook adds more guidelines for internal employee speech, banning political images in profile pics<br/>Facebook on Thursday outlined its new set of rules for employee communications within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Chief among the new changes is a requirement that employees use a photo of themselves or their initials as their profile pictures. This change would prohibit employees from setting their profile pictures to images that promote specific political candidates or causes, for instance.<br/>\"We deeply value expression, open discussion, and a company culture built on respect and inclusivity,\" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \"What we have heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed. So we're updating our policies and work tools to make sure our people have both voice, and choice.\"<br/>The new rules come a week after CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about a new set of principles to guide internal debates and conversations.<br/>Facebook's new rules will also expand the company's definition of harassment. The company will prohibit any communication that is insensitive, degrading or derogatory and could create a hostile work environment for those in a protected class.<br/>Additionally, the company will be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. Facebook will also increase its support for moderation of nonofficial Workplace groups.<br/>These changes come after a series of leaks over the past few months from employee Workplace posts as well as Facebook's weekly Q&amp;A with Zuckerberg.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 22: One of the founders of Facebook's libra digital currency has left the company<br/>One of the co-founders of Facebook's libra digital currency and Novi payments wallet has left the company before the release of either technology.<br/>Morgan Beller, 27, is leaving her post as Novi's head of strategy to become a partner at NFX, a venture capital firm focused on seed investments with offices in San Francisco and Herzliya, Israel.<br/>\"When I knew there was an opportunity to go [to NFX] and get to work with these people, that was an opportunity I couldn't really pass up,\" Beller told CNBC.<br/>Beller rose to prominence in 2019 as one of the founders behind libra, developing the idea for the Facebook-backed digital currency alongside David Marcus, a former PayPal president and Facebook vice president.<br/>After joining Facebook's corporate development team in 2017, Beller quickly turned her attention to the potential of what Facebook and its more than 2 billion users at the time could do with blockchain technology.<br/>Beller was credited by those in the blockchain community as the original driving force behind Facebook's push into cryptocurrency.<br/>Facebook expected to launch libra and Calibra, now called Novi, in the first half of 2020. Both technologies have been stonewalled by concerned regulators and lawmakers around the globe and neither has launched.<br/>Beller's departure from Facebook puts the future of libra and Novi further in doubt, though she told CNBC she'll remain an advisor for both products to help make sure they come to market.<br/>\"I love libra, I'm a fan girl of libra,\" Beller said. \"I'm not going away. I'll continue to be a friend, follow very closely and be involved at some capacity. It was just that when the NFX folks came knocking - this was obvious.\"<br/>Beller said she will continue to keep an interest in blockchain technology at NFX, but that she's open to investing in a variety of technologies.<br/>\"The crazy, weird, creative folks who are contrarians and see the world as broken or see the world differently than other people, those are the people I want to speak to,\" she said.<br/>Since its founding in 2015, NFX has kept its focus on companies that have the potential for network effects, meaning their value and capabilities increase as more and more users join.</p><p>September 22: There is really just one stock that would benefit most from antitrust action against Facebook<br/>Over the past year, Facebook has shouldered the prospect of antitrust action as a former co-founder, presidential candidates and congress members have all called for the company to be broken up. The start to that process could come as soon as this year. The Wall Street Journal this month reported the Federal Trade Commission is now gearing up to possibly file an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook before the end of 2020.<br/>An antitrust lawsuit against Facebook would kick off a years-long process. And it is unclear just what consequences the tech company would face.<br/>Among the possibilities are the divestment of Instagram, WhatsApp or both. The company could also face restrictions about what data it collects or how that data can be used to target ads to users.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 22: Facebook<br/>Shares of mega-cap technology companies fell broadly on Monday, continuing their spiral that started in early September.

In many ways, they're sounding the alarm on their own creations. One former Facebook executive, Tim Kendall, who was asked what worried him most, said: \"In the shortest time horizon, I'm most worried about civil war.\"<br/>Somewhat ironically, social media is awash with people saying they plan to delete their social media accounts after watching the show, with Facebook and Instagram appearing to be called out most frequently.<br/>\"Everyone should watch The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix and then make the necessary changes,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Tonight I deleted Facebook and turned off notifications from Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. It's time to take back control of our minds.\"<br/>Another Twitter user said: \"Just watched this and immediately deleted #Facebook and #Instagram. A must watch to understand the manipulation.\"<br/>Ranked as the 5th most watched show on Netflix in the U.K. on Friday and hailed as \"the most important documentary of our times\" by The Independent newspaper, \"The Social Dilemma\" shines a light on how tech companies influence national elections, \"follow\" billions of people around the internet in order to deliver targeted ads to them and come up with features that drive addiction.<br/>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment when asked whether it was concerned about a potential user backlash.<br/>Instead the California-headquartered firm pointed to several announcements and resources on safety and mental health.</p><p>September 17: Facebook issues new rules on internal employee communication<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday outlined to employees a new set of principles to guide debates and conversations within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Zuckerberg outlined the changes to address \"a lot of very tense conversations happening out in the world,\" according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The new principles follow a set of similar changes at Google, which is increasing the moderation of its internal message boards, CNBC reported earlier this week.<br/>\"We deeply value expression and open discussion. What we've heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,\" Osborne said in a statement. \"We're updating our employee policies and work tools to ensure our culture remains respectful and inclusive.\"<br/>The changes follow a set of recent leaks from Workplace and the company's weekly Q&amp;As showing that employees have increased their criticism of the company's policies.<br/>Under the new set of principles, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will ensure all employees feel supported at work, especially the company's Black community, by strengthening the company's harassment policy with more protections for underrepresented employees.<br/>The company will also be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. This change will be so that employees do not have to confront social issues during their day-to-day work.<br/>Facebook's new principles also ask that employees communicate with professionalism and continue to debate about the company's work but do so in a respectful manner.<br/>BuzzFeed last month reported employees criticized Zuckerberg's explanation of why the company failed to remove a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to plan an event where two protesters were shot and killed.</p><p>September 17: As Main Street crisis worsens, Facebook launches new small business platform<br/>Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.<br/>\"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.<br/>The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.<br/>Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.<br/>This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a Covid hub in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a voter information center.<br/>Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.<br/>At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S.</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>Source: The Wall Street Journal<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"544\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Google, Twitter and Facebook CEOs Threatened With Subpoena</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 16</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FTC Preparing Possible Antitrust Suit Against Facebook</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Buys REI s New Headquarters as Pandemic Prompts Sale</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 11</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Appeals Move to Curb EU-U.S. Data Transfer</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 09</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Ireland to Order Facebook to Stop Sending User Data to U.S.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 05</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook s Rittenhouse Mistake</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Bloomberg<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"552\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 27</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Sues EU Over 'Irrelevant' Demands in Antitrust Probes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 13</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Investment Helps Asia's Richest Man Shed Oil Dependence</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 06</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Helps Explain Why ESG Investing Matters</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 03</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Under Siege After Facebook Scrutiny</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Other Publishers<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Publisher</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Apple Decides to Waive 30% Cut of Paid Events on Facebook, but Only for 3 Months</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Nasdaq</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Is Starting To Get Liked Again After a Brutal Sell-Off</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">InvestorPlace on MSN.com</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Q3 2020 EPS Estimates for Facebook, Inc.

You are doing  good out here today?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, doing good.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANCIS:  He is the not the only one turning cold weather into cold hard  cash because even when they say it's not it is always about money.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baby, it is cold outside.  If you're selling ice cream or offering bike  rides, you might expect to see frozen profits and patrons fleeing to the  nearest coffee shop.  But at the iconic Serendipity 3 in New York City,  people are still lining up outside of the restaurant for a chance to sample  their signature frozen hot chocolate.  And the Pedicab business is also  apparently booming despite the freezing conditions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to explain it and braving the cold because they're all good sports,  Pedicab operator, Dior Isfandiyor.  We also have a Serendipity spokesman  Joe Calderone.  And joining us from Chicago is FOX Business reporter, Jeff  Flock.  </p><p>Jeff, I have to start with you, because I have no idea why you're standing  on top of a giant frozen mountain of ice.  Is somebody making money off  that?  </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It beats standing underneath it, I  suspect.  Yes, actually, we're in the Pilson neighborhood of Chicago.  And  if you look, that is the polar ice company.  And the sign is almost covered  with a pile of snow.  </p><p>You know what happens when you get temperatures this low, the snow doesn't  go anywhere.  You just have to keep moving it around.  And this is where  they moved it here.  The seasonal employees are making money moving the  snow.  That is one way to go in addition to the ice business which  continues.  You know, they sell dry ice all year-round.  Shipments go out.   They still have to have ice.  Who knew?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Will be fine.  Why would people be buying giant blocks of ice  when there is ice outside?  You're saying the business is booming there?  </p><p>FLOCK:  How about dry ice?  These guys supply air France.  And so, there  are shipments every day going overseas.  And so, these guys have to  continue to supply that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  </p><p>FLOCK:  And look what they're dealing with outside the ice house.  Look  what the street looks like.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is ironic.  </p><p>FLOCK:  Yes, these poor people.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is ironic.  </p><p>FLOCK:  Pretty funny.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>Joe Calderone, let me ask you.  You know, Serendipity 3 I have one of the  famous frozen hot chocolates here on set with me.  People are still lining  up to come in, and have -- there it is, doesn't it look delicious?  They're  coming in to get frozen hot chocolates in weather like this?  I don't  believe you.  </p><p>JOE CALDERONE, SPOKESPERSON, SERENDIPITY:  Yes.  No, we sell more, just as  many frozen hot chocolates during the winter months that we do during the  summer.  You know, everybody in the cold weather, everyone wants comfort  and what is more comforting than a frozen hot chocolate or bit bowl of ice  cream.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  How about a hot, hot chocolate?  I think that would be more  comforting.  I mean, you kind of led me right to that one, more comforting  than frozen hot chocolate in cold weather?  I could think of 50 things  including hot cookies, coffee, regular hot chocolate.  Will they still  really line up?  </p><p>Now, your story is so famous.  I've been down there with my kids and there  is huge line in front.  You wait forever to get in.  Are you telling me in  the arctic weather today there were still people lining up in front?  </p><p>CALDERONE:  Yes, there were still people lining up in front and all coming  for the iconic frozen hot chocolate -- frozen.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  That video must not be from today then.  </p><p>Dior, let me ask you.  </p><p>DIOR ISFANDIYOR, PEDICAB DRIVER:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, after drinking my frozen hot chocolate, the next thing I  think I would not do is get in a pedicab to drive around the city, because  that would be frozen.  Did anyone get in your pedicab today?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  Yes, we got a lot of customers today.  You know, after  drinking hot chocolate I would say, you know, I will take customers, say  you like to go dancing and get in the pedicab.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you do to keep them warm in there because, I don't know,  there is a little plastic thing on the front there that --?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  This is like going proof Cowell so wind down go inside.  There  is also like a blanket like I have, I it is like an old blanket Gortex  blanket.  It consumes like the wind coming inside.  That is why  is like --  and it goes, it is a little fun to do.  People like to do.  I mean a lot of  people, I think, if somebody don't ride the pedicab in New York City, I  would stay they didn't see New York so.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>So Dior, you know, my insides were frozen from the frozen hot chocolate and  I got inside your pedicab and pedaled around the city to freeze the outside  of my body, what would that cost me?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  I mean, you mean like how much it costs?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  What does it cost per minute?  What will you charge me to  freeze my Tucus off out there?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  We have new regulation.  We have in the summertime like $2, $3  per minute the ride.  But basically, we give the customers more discount in  wintertime because, like you know, more want to ride.  So, we give them  more --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, did you charge less today?  Is that what you're saying?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  Yes, like a cab.  Also pedicab is like a per minute ride.  No  additional fees.  And like companies gives us receipt so we give them  receipt after like -- after finishing the ride.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you mind if I ask you how much money you made today?  I mean,  how many people actually volunteered to get in that pedicab and go around  city?  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  Like basically, like, the -- because I rent from the company,  so like, basically it is like half and half.  Like how much every day you  make half for company, half for yourself.  And also including the -- you  pay taxes also.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  No, I hate taxes.  Don't even get me started on that one.   Anyone who watches the show knows about that.  </p><p>Joe, let me ask you would you get in his cab and let him drive you back to  serendipity 3 or too cold.  </p><p>CALDERONE:  Sure.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't believe you.  </p><p>CALDERONE:  No.  I will put my hood on.  Sure.  It beats walking, that's  for sure.  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  Why not?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You guys are very good sports.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>I will enjoy my frozen hot chocolate.  Dior, stay there, I will be done in  55 minutes.  We'll head uptown, OK.  </p><p>ISFANDIYOR:  No problem.  OK.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Thank you.  And thanks to Jeff Flock as well who I think, you  know, is still on top of the ice mountain out there.  There he is.  </p><p>Thanks, guys.  </p><p>FLOCK:  You're welcome.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Clearly, it is still freezing out there.  </p><p>The last thing you feel like doing is slapping your laundry through the  polar vortex to the Laundromat, right?  But if you're down to the last pair  of socks, I have to be honest you don't have much of a choice until now!   We have entrepreneur who is putting the convenience back into the cleaning  service industry and offering pretty competitive prices like the Uber-for  laundry.  He is going to be here with all the not so dirty details.  Stick  around for some of that coming up in spare change later in the show.  </p><p>Up next, it is as cool as it sounds, using Google glass in a crowded  parking lot to pinpoint exactly where your car is.  Even unlocking and  starting it with just a look on a tab.  Hyundai is getting Google up and  we're going live to Las Vegas for details.  </p><p>And the U.S. bobsled team is going for gold in a BMW.  It is faster and  sleeker than ever before.  We're talking the brains behind it all.  </p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  The consumer electronics show is in full swing and today we're  talking about an automaker partnering with Google glass.  Controversial?   Some say yes.  One San Diego woman just got pulled over and ticketed for  driving while wearing Google glass.  Auto companies and Google glass aren't  the best of friend.  But one car company is standing out from all the rest  in its completely embracing it.  </p><p>Hyundai announced its new genesis 2015 sedan interacts with the driver  through Google glass.  Here with all details is Hyundai executive director  Barry Ratzlaff and Shelly Palmer is our tech expert who is right next to  him to sort of give us his take.  </p><p>Barry, let me start with you.  Are you concerned at all?  I mean, we are  talking about somebody just got ticketed.  And a lot of people are  concerned about safety of pairing drivers with those who are wearing, you  know, Google glass?  </p><p>BARRY RATZLAFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HYUNDAI:  Yes, you know it is a very  important point.  Let me just start off by saying that driver distraction  is extremely important topic and fundamentally people should not play with  their smartphones while driving.  And in fact, a lot of what we're trying  to do here is help solve the issue.  </p><p>It is an important point to note that the Google glass app we developed for  Hyundai (INAUDIBLE) is intended for use when you are outside the car in  pre-drive experience.  In fact, we are trying to take some of things you  would normally do in the car, save you some time and help you do them  before you enter the car.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Can I ask you because you obviously have them on.  Are you  distracted right now?  What are you looking at?  Are they just clear?  </p><p>RATZLAFF:  They're clear.  I'm looking in at the camera.  They're really  out of -- they are kind in the periphery of my vision so I can look up to  see the screen when I need to, but I concentrate on task at hand without  being distracted as well.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Can police tell if you have them on and you're actually using  them or if you're just wearing them and like you are and not doing with  them?  </p><p>RATZLAFF:  So, I am actually I have a screen cast here.  So, you can see  exactly what I'm seeing in my Google glass.  This is the genesis app.  I  can enter the app and just give you a flavor for kind of things we can do.   Remote features.  Some things like, it is a little bit of lag time here for  the display.  Sorry.  POI surge.  We can do dealer search.  So, this is  exactly what I'm seeing in the screen.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, part of the advertisement was that it can help you find your  car if you can't find it in a parking lot, is that right?  How does it do  that?  </p><p>RATZLAFF:  Yes.  It is.  </p><p>So, we -- Blue link has invented cellular modem, built in to the car so we  can connect to the car remotely, the owner can.  We have got smartphone  app, the glass, app from a Web site.  You can locate your car.  Say, you  forgot where you where you park it in airport parking lot or football game  in crowded parking lot.  Like how many times have you wandered around  trying to find the car, we are providing a solution for that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right or if you had too many drinks, it can find your care for  you.  That is perfect.  </p><p>Shelly, what do you think of this?  I mean, is this going to be hit?  </p><p>SHELLY PALMER, TECH EXPERT:  This is earl days.  First of all, Google glass  is not product, it's a concept.  And when I look at Google glass helps me  look into the future.  It tells me nothing about the present.  And though  apps like this are really awesome because they tell us what we can expect  the future, and I mean, the future social logically, not technologically.  </p><p>These things that we do now are all about how we, as human beings are going  to be exo-digitally enhanced.  But what is different here is instead of  having to look at my smartphone which I carry with me all the time I have a  heads up display.  So, human beings with heads up displays -- that is the  story here.  The idea using that I'm using it to get into the car or out of  the car, that's a real question.  Distracted driving is the number one  worst thing you can do in the world.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>PALMER:  So, let's not even start to talk about it.  Let's talk -- and you  certainly don't need to put on a pair of Google glass to find your car,  whether drunk or sober.  What you do need to do -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  That is joke, by the way, obviously.  </p><p>PALMER:  No, no, no.  But it is not a joke, Melissa.  It is actually the  whole point.  The point is that what we have now is we have a heads up  display for people.  We're tied to our phone.  It outsourced our memory and  we got, of course, all wave finding.  This is how we can see it better.   I'm faster at seeing things.  I have mine on with --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  I was going to ask you that.  Are those regular glass or  they are Google glass and -- </p><p>PALMER:  No, this is my glasses with Google glass but I'm seeing  notifications.  People are texting me, hey, Shelly.  I'm getting some  tweets right now.  So, you're on FOX.  It is like, that's awesome.  I'm  seeing you and seeing that.  I don't have to look at my phone to do it.  I  know I'm getting tweeted.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Barry, let me ask you, you know, about crossover of two these two  products here because Google glass, you know, is really marketed to someone  who spends a lot of money, is pretty tech-savvy and is relatively high-end.   I think of Hyundai buyers as being, you know, very focused on a bargain and  good deal.  I'm not sure there is a lot of crossover between those two  markets.  </p><p>RATZLAFF:  You know, Shelly, Melissa, you couldn't have given me a better  setup.  On Monday at the Detroit auto show we are going to announce the  next version of our Hyundai Genesis.  It is premium rear wheel drive sedan  aimed at up market customers.  And yes, we're still a value brand.  You get  a lot of car for your money.  But it is fantastic premium product and it is  the first vehicle that we're using to launch our generation (INAUDIBLE)  platform which allows to do great stuff like the Google glass app.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  All right, guys, thank you so much.  Send me your glasses.   I need to try those out.  </p><p>BMW is going for the gold.  The U.S. Olympic team has not won a gold medal  in the bobsled race in 78 years.  But BMW is hoping to help turn that  around.  The automaker designed a brand new high-speed sled for team USA  this year.  Will it win?  </p><p>Here now is the president and CEO of BMW North America, Ludwig Willisch.  </p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>LUDWIG WILLISCH, PRESIDENT, CEO, BMW NORTH AMERICA:  My pleasure.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, it is going to win?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Sure.  That's we are.  They're going for gold.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What makes the bobsled special?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  We designed it from scratch.  And you know, we can do best is  build fast, dynamic vehicles except this time it doesn't have wheels.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  So we started building it as I said from scratch with carbon  fiber body as it has minimum weight, we could play around with the center  of gravity as we like, as we started building the sled as we need it.  And  we also went to put it into a wind tunnel.  It is really top of the art --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Have you done this before?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  No, we haven't.  But we have California-based company called  Design Works that can design basically everything.  And the designer that  actually has done the sled used to design race cars.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes. </p><p>WILLISCH:  So, he was up for the challenge and that's what it is.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is that a lot of pressure?  Because if we lose, I am going to  blame you.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Go ahead.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  No - </p><p>WILLISCH:  We're really confident.  Just look at the track record so far.   This season we've had four gold medals, five silver, five bronze.  So we're  knocking it out of the park.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You talked about the carbon fiber body.  And obviously, that is  technology that a lot of people are fascinated with, that is new, that is  very much state-of-the-art.  Has that been done before with bobsleds?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  No, it hasn't.  But we have leveraged our knowledge from our new  BMW I brand that these cars are made out of carbon fiber reinforced  plastic.  And so, we're building cars with that material.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  And we could actually, you know, use our knowledge and put, go  right ahead and build a body like we were.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  The show is called \"Money.\"  So I have to ask you about the  dollars of all this.  Did they pay you or is this about product --?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  No, this is part of our support for the BMW, for the U.S.  Olympic team.  We supported them during the Olympics in London two years  ago.  And now we're supporting them for the winter Olympics.  That is part  of our commitment to the U.S.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you pay for the sponsorship and you also provide the bobsled.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Yes.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Did they give you discount on sponsorship because you give them  the equipment they really need?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  They love the bobsled.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  I was kind of kidding and kind of not.  </p><p>What is the process of designing the bobsled?  I mean, how involved were  the actual athletes themselves?  Did they test it?  Tell me about the  process.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, we looked what was  around so far.  Then we went to the drawing board and said, what would a  optimal sled look like?  And, put it into the wind tunnel knew what  regulations were.  And then, of course, had some prototypes that we tested  and we made changes.  But we knew what it would be all about, what was  necessary to make the thing fast.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Which we, anyway, know how to make things fast.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You're a German company.  Why are you doing this for the U.S.A.  instead of Germany?  </p><p>WILLISCH:  Well, as our chairman has said quite a while ago, U.S. is our  second home and we've been committed to the U.S. for more than 40 years.   So, that what's we do here.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, thank you so much.  A lot of fun!  We look forward to seeing  that.  </p><p>All right, coming up, are unpaid internships ruining the American dream?   More and more young people are expected to work for free and the backlash  is growing.  We're talking to one group taking the issue all the way to the  White House.  </p><p>And you better pack your bags and book yourself a one-way ticket out west  because that is where the jobs are.  We have a list of the best cities for  job growth when we get back.  You will be surprised by some of them.  Yes,  that one is obvious, but we have some surprises too.  </p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money?\"  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether you spent it fetching coffee or doing research or running  errand, you probably remember the first internship, but did it ruin the  American dream for you?  </p><p>Mikey Franklin is cofounder of Fair Pay Campaign and says that unpaid  internships are ruing it for everyone.  How so?  </p><p>MIKEY FRANKLIN, COFOUNDER, FAIR PAY CAMPAIGN:  Thank you for having me.   Ultimately, the American dream is about opportunity to everyone.  And  unpaid internships are only open to people that can afford to work for  free.  If we are really committed to the notion that everyone who works  hard should be able to get ahead, we got to make sure that all jobs,  including internships, pay a wage.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Mickey, I have to stop you and disagree with you right  there.  Because I worked two and three jobs during a semester so that I  could afford to do unpaid internship in this industry because I wanted to,  because I was hungry.  You don't have to be rich.  You have to be  industrious and hungry to work and save the money to go do the internship.   I mean, that is part of what it does.  It separates out the people who are  really focused and driven and the people who won't show up unless you give  them money.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  But people who have wealthy family to support them, who have  independent wealth, they don't have to be hungry or driven.  They can just  show up anyway.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  but I think somebody who is hiring interns can smell that.  And I  mean, as somebody who has interns around all the time, you know the rich  kids and then you know kid really focused and want to be there.  So I don't  think that argument really holds water.  You have another one?  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  We've got plenty of arguments.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  Another really important argument is that everyone's work has  dignity.  Everyone's work has value.  It has nothing more important  teaching people the work they're doing is important.  And in this society,  the way we do that is by paying them a wage.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I think that what an intern is getting not being paid is  knowledge.  In most cases, interns are not doing work that is worth paying.   They're mostly watching and maybe by the end of the summer or the semester  they're contributing something.  But for the most part, they are not worth  paying.  So, if you had to pay them you wouldn't have them and that  internship would just go away.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  You know, Melissa, I speak to hundreds of interns.  I was an  intern myself.  I don't hear from interns saying they were sitting and  watching.  I hear from interns who say that they were doing substantive and  important work.  </p><p>Let's take example of interns on production of black swan who sued FOX  searchlight successfully.  They were not sitting around watching.  They  were doing important tasks.  They were runners on set of the film.  They  were doing work that needed to be done.  So, we are saying they deserved a  wage.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I think in that case in particular, you know, I mean, they were  doing a lot of grunt work and running work and you're right, that that is a  type of situation where they would just hire professionals.  So, if they're  forced to be paid they would have hired someone in the industry.  And those  kids that were hired in that case would not have gotten that job and  wouldn't have gotten a break in the industry.  </p><p>I mean, they were doing work for free as way to get into the industry.  If  that were a paid position, there are about 2,000, 3,000 people in Hollywood  that would have gobbled it up.  And those interns would not have the  opportunity or not gotten into the business.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  I'm sorry.  I don't understand your question.  I mean, of  course, I disagree with your, with your assertion.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm saying those two people, would not have gotten that job if it  was paid.  It would have gone to someone with a resume' who had a  background because there are tons of people in Hollywood who want that job.  </p><p>So, is that OK with you, that if it is paid, those students who had the job  with a break in industry, you don't get a leg up, you don't get the  entrance in to the industry?  Instead, it goes to somebody already there.   Is that OK with you?  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  That is clearly not going to happen.  First of all it wasn't  job, it was internship.  If it was a job it would be paid.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You're saying pay them.  That makes it a job, not internship any  longer.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  The internship, the film industry or the political industry or  journalism industry, every industry has to keep on bringing in new people.   Every industry needs new talent, new graduates, new workers keen to learn  and develop the industry.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Not in Hollywood.  They have more people than can possibly fill.   I mean, they have more people than can fill all jobs they have in  Hollywood.  No one would ever get a start in Hollywood at this point.  I  mean, there are so many unemployed people walking around Hollywood.  I  mean, there are industries that can just afford to do it.  the industry is,  I mean, that is where the unpaid internships go - </p><p>FRANKLIN:  FOX searchlight can afford to do this.  FOX searchlight can  afford this as every other production company asking can they not?  FOX  searchlight is part of billion dollar parent company.  The notion of they  can afford $7.25 an hour --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I didn't say they can't afford it.  No one ever said that.  Of  course, they absolutely can afford.  But then, no one who is new in the  industry would ever get in because you would get somebody who has a resume'  would get that job.  They can definitely afford it.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  But every other industry and every other country where the  practice changed demonstrates that is not true, other industries in which  these practice is less widespread, particularly tech industry.  The big  tech organization is hugely competitive to work there.  They all pay their  interns in fair wage, but they are still attracting and bringing in  talented young workers and new staff.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Mikey, thanks so much for coming on.  We appreciate your  thoughts.  </p><p>FRANKLIN:  Thank you so much for your time.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next, is anyone you know looking for a job?  Then stick  around.  We have the top cities across America for job growth.  And you  won't believe what's on the list.  </p><p>And \"who made Money today?\"  This pop siren was rolling in the cash when  she released her hit album back in 2011.  But rumor has it she is still  laughing all the way to the bank three years later.  </p><p>\"Piles of Money\" coming right up.  That is so obvious, come on.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  The top cities or job growth across America, did your town make  the list?  A new study from the Milken Institute ranks the best places to  be, and here with the big reveal is the man behind the report, chief  research officer at the Milken Institute, Ross DeVol.  We've also got  Fortune editor, Adam Lashinsky, who is a Fox News contributor.  Thanks to  both of you.  Ross, let me start with you.  What is the number one city on  the list?</p><p>ROSS DEVOL, CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER, MILKEN INSTITUTE:  It's Austin, and  thanks for having me on, Melissa.  Austin has been a perennial top  performer.  It's a city that has both technology, it has low business  costs, it has low regulatory environment, and is overall very business  friendly, and also is the top university if you receive Texas, Austin.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Is it basically all tech jobs?  I mean, what's available in  Austin?</p><p>DEVOL:  It's not all tech jobs, but certainly, the leading growth has been  in the technology area.  Computer systems analysts, for example, make over  $82,000 in Austin substantially above the national average wage for all  industries.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Adam, I mean, you're a tech guru, is this whole study going to be  in your -- anticipation is going to all be about places where computer  programmers can get jobs?  Is that what the future is?</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Well, it's not only where  the future is but where the growth is now.  These sorts of studies show  where jobs are growing.  I've been a witness to what's going on in San  Francisco, which you know, interestingly, has none of the things that Ross  mentioned with the exception of a vibrant technology business and great  universities, but it's not a great business environment.</p><p>It's not a low cost place to live or to hire, and yet, the San Francisco  did extremely well on the list for that reason.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's true.  I mean, it's number three on the list.  So, it may  be a great place for job growth but it's not where you would necessarily  want to move to have those jobs.  I mean, the cost of housing, for example,  is just a fortune.  So, Ross, I mean, do you compensate for that on the  list at all?</p><p>DEVOL:  Well, no, we don't compensate.  We don't measure housing costs.  In  fact, places that have low housing cost have very low job growth because  there's no demand.  A person going to a tech job in San Francisco to work  for sales for Oracle or Twitter, they're looking for the next breakthrough  technology to really hit it, and it's not just about the wages, it's also  about stock options to be able to cash-in someday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  No, and actually, I'll correct you on your own study,  because you talk about the cost-of-living.  Number two on your list is  Provo, Utah and the average cost of living there is eight percent below the  national average.  So, to me, of all the ones on your list, that seem like  sort of the pick of the litter because there's a lot of job growth there,  but the cost of living is lower.  How is that possible?  Ross.</p><p>DEVOL:  Well, it's an emerging technologies center.  It doesn't have the  concentration of technology that Austin, San Jose, or San Francisco has.   But it's -- using that university, the Brigham Young University which has  been spending out technology firms and working with the companies they have  there such as Nuvel (ph) in the software field, and they've been very  successful.  So, there's no one strategy, there's some low cost, low  regulation areas, but you can offset that by being very innovative in  places like San Francisco and San Jose.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Adam, what kind of jobs are we talking about here?  For people  who are out there watching this and are saying, I don't know, maybe I can  go and get retrained and learn to do something in a tech industry, because  this is where all the jobs are?  You know, what kind of jobs are we talking  about?</p><p>LASHINSKY:  My sense is those aren't the kinds of jobs that Ross is talking  about at all, certainly not in San Francisco.  What we have here for the  second time in my short 15 -- almost 15 years here is a gold rush  mentality, right?  So, young people in particular looking for their fame  and fortune as a metaphor are coming here to do whatever they can do.  So,  if their computer programmers, they're right in the sweet spot.</p><p>But, when there's so much money slashing around as there is today,  everybody else is looking for a way to make a buck on it, too.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  I don't think there's a huge opportunity for retraining,  though, to be candid.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, Ross, I mean, does that mean are you better off going to a  place like San Francisco where everybody is going to seek their fame and  fortune or are you better off going to one of the up and coming cities on  this list like Provo, for example?  I mean, is there actually more  opportunity there because it's a less popular place to go?</p><p>DEVOL:  It really depends upon what your motivational factors are.  If you  really want to be with the best and brightest are and hit it big in the  technology area, you have that opportunity, the San Franciscos, the  Cambridge Massachusetts, the San Joses, Silicon Valley, and the places you  want to be, but there are some sleepers out there -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>DEVOL:  -- that are newly emerging technology centers such Raleigh and  Cary, North Carolina.  You can look at Portland.  Seattle is on our list as  well in the top 10.  So, there's no one prescription, there's no one place  to go, but if you're looking for a more family-friendly atmosphere, you  know, eventually maybe you want to get married and have kids, A Provo, Salt  Lake City are very attractive.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Adam, I mean, what about that?  Were you surprised to see Utah  twice in the top five?</p><p>LASHINSKY:  No.  There's always been a vibrant technology seen or at least  there has been for the past 20 years.  Of course, they have several good  universities in the area.  And it's close to nature.</p><p>I think it's a place where people enjoy living and I smiled when Ross said  about if you want to have a family, that -- for whatever reason, for  various reasons, Utah is a very family friendly place, there's no doubt, as  someone who is raising a family in San Francisco that San Francisco is a  less family friendly place.  So, it depends not only -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Wait, why is it less family friendly?</p><p>LASHINSKY:  It's expensive.  The schools are a challenge.  You know, to  find a place to live is both difficult and extremely expensive.  These are  all things that make you work harder -- challenges if you want to raise a  family in a particular area.  I'm not saying you can't do it.  I'm doing  it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY:  But it would be easier to go to a lesser market.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  No.  I just want to clarify that for audience.  They're not  hostile to kids.  It's that it's really expensive and it's hard to get into  school.  I don't know or maybe -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LASHINSKY:  Some have argued that the city of San Francisco is.  There've  been studies about how families flee San Francisco as soon as kids get to  be school age.  I'm not necessarily taking that position, but you're not  far off.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Guys, thanks to both of you.  A lot of great information  there.  Appreciate it.</p><p>DEVOL:  You're welcome, Melissa.  Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, forget the year-end bonus, workers want incentive  right here, right now.  In fact, one study says making employees wait  months and months for a bonus can do a company more harm than good.  What  do you think?  Is the once a year bonus keeping you loyal?  Watch and tweet  me about what you think.  Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to go, because  at the end of the day, it is all about cold hard cash.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, did you start off the brand New Year with a bonus?  If you  did, was it cold hard cash or a hearty handshake?  Companies and employees  are ever debating the benefits of the bonus.  Is it is a gesture of thanks  from employee's hard work or has it become a source of competition and  entitlement?  And most importantly, at the end of the day, do they even  work?</p><p>Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to battle over bonuses.  We have Julie  Roginsky, Mercedes Colwin, and Jack Burkman.  What do you, guys, think?   What do you think?  Is money a motivator?  What do you think, Julie?</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So, I'm a champ, because I always  give my assistant a bonus every year -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  He'll tell you right now -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  He knows how much is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  It's kind of like it's gotten to -- he's been with me for 11  years.  so, it's gotten to the point where -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Something is working.  He's been with you for 11 years.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  He's just probably -- get another job.  Knowing him -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I know, but actually, why would you?  Like, you know, you're  getting a bonus on top of your salary.  It's got for good (ph) one year.  I  didn't give him a bonus, he'd be like -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  He'd be furious.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  He'd probably furious.  So, you know, I don't know.  But I think  what's more motivating is actually a hearty thank you.  I really do -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?</p><p>JACK BURKMAN, RADIO HOST:  Oh, come on!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN:  The bonuses cost -- I don't care if you're talking about Goldman  or if you're talking about my little radio show, if you're talking about a  restaurant, anything in between, bonuses cost very, very little.  Companies  get a huge upside for very little money.  Worse part of it is if you don't  pay it, there's a huge downside, because people expect this at Christmas -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>BURKMAN:  -- from my lobbying firm, I mean, I don't know.  You spend 10  grand, 15 grand on Christmas.  I get a million bucks in upside for spending  -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  How do you measure that?  How do you know that?</p><p>BURKMAN:  Well, you know it by the way people approach their job.  You know  it by the way they look when they come in the morning -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, why do it once a year then?  Because that's one of the points  of this is that maybe the bonus works, but doing it once a year doesn't  keep -- people motivated -- </p><p>BURKMAN:  For tradition.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It motivates them in November.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  It motivates them in April.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY:  And that's a big issue.  So, if it's only going  to be once a year at the end of the year, then suddenly, that last quarter,  their behavior is going to get better.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>COLWIN:  They're going to be much more industrious.  They're going to work  a lot harder.  Well, you know what, that shouldn't be the case.  Start  doing it quarterly, start doing it from the beginning.  And frankly, it  really is generational, too.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>COLWIN:  If you're talking about the folks that -- the new millennials -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>COLWIN:  -- they want money.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN:  If you break it up, the problem is that it's too small and it  doesn't have the impact.  If you build the excitement and the anticipation,  you hit them at the end, anticipation everybody thinks in terms of the  holiday bonus whether you're the investment banker that wants to, you know,  by the emerald for your girlfriend or whether you're the poor person that  needs to pay the tuition, they all wait for that holiday -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  It was interesting in this business article.  They said, studies  have shown that financial incentives are poor motivators.  I clicked  through on the studies, and it went to like a YouTube video.  I don't know  what studies -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- that money doesn't (ph) motivate.  Julie, money motivates.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  No.  And I do what I do because I'm a champ, but I think what  actually motivates is if you treat your staff well if they do a good job -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  That actually should be both.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yes, you do, but how many people, actually -- and a lot of  people I know who work in investment banking, although, they're motivated  primarily by money, but people who are not necessarily just motivated by  that get offended because they truly hate their bosses.  They do what they  need to do -- </p><p>BURKMAN:  But the Christmas bonus makes up for hatred of the bosses.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  It does but it doesn't provide the good work ethic that you want  because if you're actually -- if you know your boss appreciates you -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how do you fix that?  How do you -- I mean, some of the  suggestions are, you know, that you built out a way that they can  anticipate what they're going to get based on goals.  I mean, do you do  that?  Do you sort of set expectations -- </p><p>BURKMAN:  Here's the thing, if you do that, it's easy to say that, but then  it becomes part of their salary.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>BURKMAN:  In other words, if you say, OK, we're going to split the  Christmas bonus into five things, they say, oh, that salary.  Now, the  holiday is coming, there's no bang.  There's no push.  So then, it just all  becomes salary.  You have to -- it's like Henry Ford.  You have to play a  little bit of psychological game with the workers.  It's money, yes, but  it's also, you have to kind of trick them.  It's psychology.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That is so ugly and it's so true.  I mean, either of you guys  want to disagree with -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  No.  I don't practice it, because as I said an (INAUDIBLE), but  what you said is -- </p><p>BURKMAN:  You're just a better person.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yes.  I kind of -- </p><p>COLWIN:  I'm a true Democrat.  I give it away.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN:  The money, nothing else, but yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, it's about -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN:  Talking about the bonuses.  Nothing else.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But it is a little bit about that element of surprise, right?  I  mean, isn't there that game where if you really like an employee, you're  trying to anticipate what they think they're going to get and then surprise  them a little bit to the upside?  Is there a punishment?  I mean, do you  take the person who is not as good as they should have been and you still  give them something but it's less from they anticipated?  It's getting a  little tricky.</p><p>COLWIN:  Yes, it gets tricky, but -- I mean, certainly in our industry.  If  you're not doing well as a lawyer, you really can't compensate this  individual, whether it's a bonus or salary, some other incentives, you  really have to have some punitive measure with the attorneys.  I think it  depends on -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how does the conversation go at Christmas time?  I mean, do  you bring someone in and you say, I know, you think you're getting a bonus  but you're not?</p><p>COLWIN:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Have you done that?</p><p>COLWIN:  Absolutely.  Unquestionably.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Does the person cry?  Do they throw things at you?  Have you  called security -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN:  It hasn't gotten that bad, but yes.  I mean, they do.  They get  really upset.  And also, they're like, what?  I mean, especially lawyers  who have a pretty healthy ego.  They're like -- you mean, we don't walk on  water?  We're not the best thing going?  How could you not see how  brilliant and great I am?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>COLWIN:  You got to deal and compete with that ego, too.  But no, the  bottom line -- </p><p>BURKMAN:  We run the car business.  The family was in the car business.   There's an old saying, 20 percent of the salesman make 80 percent of the  sales.  But what you got to do is you have to highly compensate the  producers, quickly weed out (ph) and get rid of everybody else.  That's the  key to business.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN:  And bonuses are part -- </p><p>ROGINSKY:  But to your point, I think if somebody is really bad, you don't  not give them a bonus, you just fire them, which I've got to do.  If  they're not good, you just -- they have to go.</p><p>BURKMAN:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What about non-monetary things?  I mean, is that just a total  waste of time and people are looking and they want cash?  I mean -- this  article as well that said the money doesn't motivate.  It's says you could  give out gift baskets.  I think the employee, he'll get status (ph) like,  what did you spend on this and why didn't you just give me the 300 bucks or  whatever it is?  I mean, isn't that true?</p><p>BURKMAN:  Yes.  You can't insult them.  You know, that's like saying I'm  going to give them a book or something for Christmas.  You just have to  make a quick decision like we've been saying if there -- it's the Henry  Ford thing.  If they're a good employee, you want them heavily compensated.   Bonus is part of that.  If not, boot (ph) -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  All right.  Wow!  Very -- harsh but enlightening.  Thanks,  you guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Coming up, New York is one of the most progressive cities in the  world, but when it comes to laundry, it is stuck in the dark ages.  Well,  forget about slamming it down the Laundromat when innovative businessman is  turning your undies into big box.  Don't move.  You can never have too much  MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's time for a little fun with \"Spare Change.\"  It may seem like  a simple mundane task, but hardly, anyone loves doing laundry.  The concept  of paying for pick up isn't new but using your phone for your dirty desk  (ph) could be the next big thing.  Seth Berkowitz is co-founder of the new  service, FlyCleaners, and he hopes this idea is the answer to all your  problems.</p><p>So Seth, we were talking about in the commercial break, from the front of  my apartment, if I pair off (ph) the window, I can see three different dry  cleaners that I could call and they would come over in a second and do my  laundry and bring it back.  Why do I need your app?</p><p>SETH BERKOWITZ, FLY CLEANERS CO-FOUNDER AND CEO:  Will they do it at 11  o'clock at night?</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  On a Sunday?</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  That would be a very big difference.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  So, I can find any time of day?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  So, we're open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight seven days a week.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And how long does it take for them to get the laundry back?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  So, we have an instant pick-up model where it will come to your  house sometimes within 30 minutes, sometimes less, actually checked the app  -- is 26 minutes would have been in my house (ph).  But it can be back.   The app will keep you posted and we'll be back at your house as soon as the  next instant pickup.  So -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, wait.  So, you bring it back the next day?  I mean, if it's  Sunday night and I'm looking to get my, you know, socks picked up.  I'm  pretty desperate.  So, I need it back pretty quick.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  All right.  So, for a typical cleaning, for laundry, it can be  the same day.  If we picked it up on Sunday night, would it be Sunday -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Monday in afternoon, but for dry cleaning, it could be up to 48  hours.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You charge a premium for this?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  We don't.  We actually have very competitive pricing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how do you make money then because the show is called MONEY?   I didn't know if you know that.  How do you make money?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  So, there's no brick and mortar model here.  This is entirely  delivery basing technology.  So, we're not paying for retail space on the  corner of Broadway and -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  But if you're charging $0.99 a pound in the dry cleaners or the  Laundromat is making part of that money, it's hard for me to imagine that  you're making very much money on this.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  There's margin in it.  You scale up the business and it can be  very successful.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You were not a newbie to this business of waving your phone or  your iPad and getting something done.  You started a very successful  business called Insomnia Cookies.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  That's correct.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That was based on a similar premise where it's people in the  middle of the night who'd just really need a cinnamon oatmeal raisin  cookie, and all of a sudden, they need to get their phone out and have it  delivered.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's a successful business.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  We have 43 locations.  We're supposed to open one up tomorrow  and six more are coming in the next three months.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Forty-three locations around the country?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  There are that many people who need cookies in an instant and  didn't buy, you know, the pre-made Pillsbury dough from the grocery store  and pop in the oven.  That's not good enough.  They got to call you on the  cookies? </p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Well, so we have a college business market or we have locations  at major college market -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  -- college kids, they would need cookies -- </p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Right.  Until 3:00 in the morning is the insomnia model.  So,  that's a pretty robust model (ph) there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, I imagine, the laundry would be big for them as well?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  We like a little bit more of a dense (ph) marketplace.  So, New  York City, big cities would be better more for FlyCleaners than Insomnia.   Although, Insomnia thrives in New York City.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  I mean, the laundry -- the only thing about the laundry  business is it does seem like something they would only work in New York  because we're the only place where you would pay a million dollars for an  apartment and still not have a washer and dryer inside.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  Not the only one.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Where else do you think this would work?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  D.C., Boston, but there are many options.  We're not sure  exactly yet.  We have to continue to iterate our model and see -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  The cookies were a huge hit.  The laundry sounds like a good  idea.  What's your next idea?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  I don't know.  it took 10 years to come up with the second one.   So, we'll talk in 2020 something.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  How many laundry companies are signed up to work with you right  now in New York?  I mean, how big is that business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  We have partnerships with the number of wholesalers.  It's not  a huge number.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, it's not like the local dry cleaner?  It's not like you're  farming out their business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  No.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You have like one central place the laundry is going to.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  We work with a couple of partner, couple of local partners.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  So, if you lose one of my socks then what?  Are you down  there looking in the bin for the lost sock that's gone?  It's one always  goes missing.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  It's true.  It's not me, but I mean, FlyCleaners is built on  responsibility and tremendous customer service.  So, if you lost your sock,  you'd e-mail us, we'd pay you back your sock.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Oh, you'd pay -- you're not going to find it.  See, that's  honest.  You just give me the money for it.  No one's going to find -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  I've lost a million socks and I've never got anything back for  it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  Seth, thank you so much.  A lot of fun.</p><p>BERKOWITZ:  I appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next, \"Who Made Money Today?\"  The soulful Brit (ph) is still  making a ton of money and smashing all kinds of records despite not having  an album for three years already.  You want to know who it is.  Keep  watching.  You can never have too much MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made  Money Today.\"  Anyone who owns Constellation Brand, the wine and spirits  maker is still benefiting from its buyout of beer (ph) with its latest  earnings jumping by more than 90 percent.  The company is so optimistic  about its American beer sale that it's raised its earnings forecast for the  whole year.  That what's the appetite of investors everywhere.</p><p>The stock soared more than 9.5 percent.  Chief executive, Rob Sands, must  be pleased.  He owns nearly 3.2 million shares, so he made $21 million  today.  I'll drink to that.</p><p>And making money for charity.  Jay-Z, his controversial clothing line made  headlines around the world when his retail collaborator, Barney's, was  accused of racial profiling.  But that hasn't stopped him from bringing the  big box.  In fact, it's already made more than million dollars and it all  goes -- Beyonce's Sean Carter Foundation which helps out young people that  can't afford to go to college.  Very nice.</p><p>Making even more money.  Stellar musician, Adele, the British soul diva  continues to smash records with her hit album 21 nearly three years after  its released.  Three years.  The record has become the first ever digital  album to sell more than three million copies.  Industry insiders are  surprised it was the top-selling album in all of 2011 and 2012, but here's  the weird thing, 21 was actually the 21st best-selling album of last year  and also the 21st album ever surpass 10 million copies in sales.  Kind of  creepy, right?</p><p>All right.  That's all we've got for you.  I hope you made money today.   Tune in tomorrow and hear Congressman David Schweikert on the war of  economic mobility.  It's all wrapped up in the health care -- and it's got  everyone talking.  That's tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.  Be sure to set your DVR  every day at 5:00 to get your fix of everything MONEY.  We will see you  back here tomorrow.  \"The Willis Report\" is next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

You are doing good out here today?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, doing good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANCIS: He is the not the only one turning cold weather into cold hard cash because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baby, it is cold outside. If you're selling ice cream or offering bike rides, you might expect to see frozen profits and patrons fleeing to the nearest coffee shop. But at the iconic Serendipity 3 in New York City, people are still lining up outside of the restaurant for a chance to sample their signature frozen hot chocolate. And the Pedicab business is also apparently booming despite the freezing conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to explain it and braving the cold because they're all good sports, Pedicab operator, Dior Isfandiyor. We also have a Serendipity spokesman Joe Calderone. And joining us from Chicago is FOX Business reporter, Jeff Flock.</p><p>Jeff, I have to start with you, because I have no idea why you're standing on top of a giant frozen mountain of ice. Is somebody making money off that?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It beats standing underneath it, I suspect. Yes, actually, we're in the Pilson neighborhood of Chicago. And if you look, that is the polar ice company. And the sign is almost covered with a pile of snow.</p><p>You know what happens when you get temperatures this low, the snow doesn't go anywhere. You just have to keep moving it around. And this is where they moved it here. The seasonal employees are making money moving the snow. That is one way to go in addition to the ice business which continues. You know, they sell dry ice all year-round. Shipments go out. They still have to have ice. Who knew?</p><p>FRANCIS: Will be fine. Why would people be buying giant blocks of ice when there is ice outside? You're saying the business is booming there?</p><p>FLOCK: How about dry ice? These guys supply air France. And so, there are shipments every day going overseas. And so, these guys have to continue to supply that.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FLOCK: And look what they're dealing with outside the ice house. Look what the street looks like.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is ironic.</p><p>FLOCK: Yes, these poor people.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is ironic.</p><p>FLOCK: Pretty funny.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>Joe Calderone, let me ask you. You know, Serendipity 3 I have one of the famous frozen hot chocolates here on set with me. People are still lining up to come in, and have -- there it is, doesn't it look delicious? They're coming in to get frozen hot chocolates in weather like this? I don't believe you.</p><p>JOE CALDERONE, SPOKESPERSON, SERENDIPITY: Yes. No, we sell more, just as many frozen hot chocolates during the winter months that we do during the summer. You know, everybody in the cold weather, everyone wants comfort and what is more comforting than a frozen hot chocolate or bit bowl of ice cream.</p><p>FRANCIS: How about a hot, hot chocolate? I think that would be more comforting. I mean, you kind of led me right to that one, more comforting than frozen hot chocolate in cold weather? I could think of 50 things including hot cookies, coffee, regular hot chocolate. Will they still really line up?</p><p>Now, your story is so famous. I've been down there with my kids and there is huge line in front. You wait forever to get in. Are you telling me in the arctic weather today there were still people lining up in front?</p><p>CALDERONE: Yes, there were still people lining up in front and all coming for the iconic frozen hot chocolate -- frozen.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. That video must not be from today then.</p><p>Dior, let me ask you.</p><p>DIOR ISFANDIYOR, PEDICAB DRIVER: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, after drinking my frozen hot chocolate, the next thing I think I would not do is get in a pedicab to drive around the city, because that would be frozen. Did anyone get in your pedicab today?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Yes, we got a lot of customers today. You know, after drinking hot chocolate I would say, you know, I will take customers, say you like to go dancing and get in the pedicab.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you do to keep them warm in there because, I don't know, there is a little plastic thing on the front there that --?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: This is like going proof Cowell so wind down go inside. There is also like a blanket like I have, I it is like an old blanket Gortex blanket. It consumes like the wind coming inside. That is why is like -- and it goes, it is a little fun to do. People like to do. I mean a lot of people, I think, if somebody don't ride the pedicab in New York City, I would stay they didn't see New York so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>So Dior, you know, my insides were frozen from the frozen hot chocolate and I got inside your pedicab and pedaled around the city to freeze the outside of my body, what would that cost me?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: I mean, you mean like how much it costs?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. What does it cost per minute? What will you charge me to freeze my Tucus off out there?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: We have new regulation. We have in the summertime like $2, $3 per minute the ride. But basically, we give the customers more discount in wintertime because, like you know, more want to ride. So, we give them more --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, did you charge less today? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Yes, like a cab. Also pedicab is like a per minute ride. No additional fees. And like companies gives us receipt so we give them receipt after like -- after finishing the ride.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you mind if I ask you how much money you made today? I mean, how many people actually volunteered to get in that pedicab and go around city?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Like basically, like, the -- because I rent from the company, so like, basically it is like half and half. Like how much every day you make half for company, half for yourself. And also including the -- you pay taxes also.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, I hate taxes. Don't even get me started on that one. Anyone who watches the show knows about that.</p><p>Joe, let me ask you would you get in his cab and let him drive you back to serendipity 3 or too cold.</p><p>CALDERONE: Sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't believe you.</p><p>CALDERONE: No. I will put my hood on. Sure. It beats walking, that's for sure.</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Why not?</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys are very good sports. Thank you so much.</p><p>I will enjoy my frozen hot chocolate. Dior, stay there, I will be done in 55 minutes. We'll head uptown, OK.</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: No problem. OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you. And thanks to Jeff Flock as well who I think, you know, is still on top of the ice mountain out there. There he is.</p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p>FLOCK: You're welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: Clearly, it is still freezing out there.</p><p>The last thing you feel like doing is slapping your laundry through the polar vortex to the Laundromat, right? But if you're down to the last pair of socks, I have to be honest you don't have much of a choice until now! We have entrepreneur who is putting the convenience back into the cleaning service industry and offering pretty competitive prices like the Uber-for laundry. He is going to be here with all the not so dirty details. Stick around for some of that coming up in spare change later in the show.</p><p>Up next, it is as cool as it sounds, using Google glass in a crowded parking lot to pinpoint exactly where your car is. Even unlocking and starting it with just a look on a tab. Hyundai is getting Google up and we're going live to Las Vegas for details.</p><p>And the U.S. bobsled team is going for gold in a BMW. It is faster and sleeker than ever before. We're talking the brains behind it all.</p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: The consumer electronics show is in full swing and today we're talking about an automaker partnering with Google glass. Controversial? Some say yes. One San Diego woman just got pulled over and ticketed for driving while wearing Google glass. Auto companies and Google glass aren't the best of friend. But one car company is standing out from all the rest in its completely embracing it.</p><p>Hyundai announced its new genesis 2015 sedan interacts with the driver through Google glass. Here with all details is Hyundai executive director Barry Ratzlaff and Shelly Palmer is our tech expert who is right next to him to sort of give us his take.</p><p>Barry, let me start with you. Are you concerned at all? I mean, we are talking about somebody just got ticketed. And a lot of people are concerned about safety of pairing drivers with those who are wearing, you know, Google glass?</p><p>BARRY RATZLAFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HYUNDAI: Yes, you know it is a very important point. Let me just start off by saying that driver distraction is extremely important topic and fundamentally people should not play with their smartphones while driving. And in fact, a lot of what we're trying to do here is help solve the issue.</p><p>It is an important point to note that the Google glass app we developed for Hyundai (INAUDIBLE) is intended for use when you are outside the car in pre-drive experience. In fact, we are trying to take some of things you would normally do in the car, save you some time and help you do them before you enter the car.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can I ask you because you obviously have them on. Are you distracted right now? What are you looking at? Are they just clear?</p><p>RATZLAFF: They're clear. I'm looking in at the camera. They're really out of -- they are kind in the periphery of my vision so I can look up to see the screen when I need to, but I concentrate on task at hand without being distracted as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can police tell if you have them on and you're actually using them or if you're just wearing them and like you are and not doing with them?</p><p>RATZLAFF: So, I am actually I have a screen cast here. So, you can see exactly what I'm seeing in my Google glass. This is the genesis app. I can enter the app and just give you a flavor for kind of things we can do. Remote features. Some things like, it is a little bit of lag time here for the display. Sorry. POI surge. We can do dealer search. So, this is exactly what I'm seeing in the screen.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, part of the advertisement was that it can help you find your car if you can't find it in a parking lot, is that right? How does it do that?</p><p>RATZLAFF: Yes. It is.</p><p>So, we -- Blue link has invented cellular modem, built in to the car so we can connect to the car remotely, the owner can. We have got smartphone app, the glass, app from a Web site. You can locate your car. Say, you forgot where you where you park it in airport parking lot or football game in crowded parking lot. Like how many times have you wandered around trying to find the car, we are providing a solution for that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right or if you had too many drinks, it can find your care for you. That is perfect.</p><p>Shelly, what do you think of this? I mean, is this going to be hit?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, TECH EXPERT: This is earl days. First of all, Google glass is not product, it's a concept. And when I look at Google glass helps me look into the future. It tells me nothing about the present. And though apps like this are really awesome because they tell us what we can expect the future, and I mean, the future social logically, not technologically.</p><p>These things that we do now are all about how we, as human beings are going to be exo-digitally enhanced. But what is different here is instead of having to look at my smartphone which I carry with me all the time I have a heads up display. So, human beings with heads up displays -- that is the story here. The idea using that I'm using it to get into the car or out of the car, that's a real question. Distracted driving is the number one worst thing you can do in the world.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>PALMER: So, let's not even start to talk about it. Let's talk -- and you certainly don't need to put on a pair of Google glass to find your car, whether drunk or sober. What you do need to do --</p><p>FRANCIS: That is joke, by the way, obviously.</p><p>PALMER: No, no, no. But it is not a joke, Melissa. It is actually the whole point. The point is that what we have now is we have a heads up display for people. We're tied to our phone. It outsourced our memory and we got, of course, all wave finding. This is how we can see it better. I'm faster at seeing things. I have mine on with --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I was going to ask you that. Are those regular glass or they are Google glass and --</p><p>PALMER: No, this is my glasses with Google glass but I'm seeing notifications. People are texting me, hey, Shelly. I'm getting some tweets right now. So, you're on FOX. It is like, that's awesome. I'm seeing you and seeing that. I don't have to look at my phone to do it. I know I'm getting tweeted.</p><p>FRANCIS: Barry, let me ask you, you know, about crossover of two these two products here because Google glass, you know, is really marketed to someone who spends a lot of money, is pretty tech-savvy and is relatively high-end. I think of Hyundai buyers as being, you know, very focused on a bargain and good deal. I'm not sure there is a lot of crossover between those two markets.</p><p>RATZLAFF: You know, Shelly, Melissa, you couldn't have given me a better setup. On Monday at the Detroit auto show we are going to announce the next version of our Hyundai Genesis. It is premium rear wheel drive sedan aimed at up market customers. And yes, we're still a value brand. You get a lot of car for your money. But it is fantastic premium product and it is the first vehicle that we're using to launch our generation (INAUDIBLE) platform which allows to do great stuff like the Google glass app.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, guys, thank you so much. Send me your glasses. I need to try those out.</p><p>BMW is going for the gold. The U.S. Olympic team has not won a gold medal in the bobsled race in 78 years. But BMW is hoping to help turn that around. The automaker designed a brand new high-speed sled for team USA this year. Will it win?</p><p>Here now is the president and CEO of BMW North America, Ludwig Willisch.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LUDWIG WILLISCH, PRESIDENT, CEO, BMW NORTH AMERICA: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it is going to win?</p><p>WILLISCH: Sure. That's we are. They're going for gold.</p><p>FRANCIS: What makes the bobsled special?</p><p>WILLISCH: We designed it from scratch. And you know, we can do best is build fast, dynamic vehicles except this time it doesn't have wheels.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>WILLISCH: So we started building it as I said from scratch with carbon fiber body as it has minimum weight, we could play around with the center of gravity as we like, as we started building the sled as we need it. And we also went to put it into a wind tunnel. It is really top of the art --</p><p>FRANCIS: Have you done this before?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, we haven't. But we have California-based company called Design Works that can design basically everything. And the designer that actually has done the sled used to design race cars.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: So, he was up for the challenge and that's what it is.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is that a lot of pressure? Because if we lose, I am going to blame you.</p><p>WILLISCH: Go ahead.</p><p>FRANCIS: No -</p><p>WILLISCH: We're really confident. Just look at the track record so far. This season we've had four gold medals, five silver, five bronze. So we're knocking it out of the park.</p><p>FRANCIS: You talked about the carbon fiber body. And obviously, that is technology that a lot of people are fascinated with, that is new, that is very much state-of-the-art. Has that been done before with bobsleds?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, it hasn't. But we have leveraged our knowledge from our new BMW I brand that these cars are made out of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. And so, we're building cars with that material.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: And we could actually, you know, use our knowledge and put, go right ahead and build a body like we were.</p><p>FRANCIS: The show is called \"Money.\" So I have to ask you about the dollars of all this. Did they pay you or is this about product --?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, this is part of our support for the BMW, for the U.S. Olympic team. We supported them during the Olympics in London two years ago. And now we're supporting them for the winter Olympics. That is part of our commitment to the U.S.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you pay for the sponsorship and you also provide the bobsled.</p><p>WILLISCH: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Did they give you discount on sponsorship because you give them the equipment they really need?</p><p>WILLISCH: They love the bobsled.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I was kind of kidding and kind of not.</p><p>What is the process of designing the bobsled? I mean, how involved were the actual athletes themselves? Did they test it? Tell me about the process.</p><p>WILLISCH: Yes, absolutely. I mean, first of all, we looked what was around so far. Then we went to the drawing board and said, what would a optimal sled look like? And, put it into the wind tunnel knew what regulations were. And then, of course, had some prototypes that we tested and we made changes. But we knew what it would be all about, what was necessary to make the thing fast.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: Which we, anyway, know how to make things fast.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're a German company. Why are you doing this for the U.S.A. instead of Germany?</p><p>WILLISCH: Well, as our chairman has said quite a while ago, U.S. is our second home and we've been committed to the U.S. for more than 40 years. So, that what's we do here.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, thank you so much. A lot of fun! We look forward to seeing that.</p><p>All right, coming up, are unpaid internships ruining the American dream? More and more young people are expected to work for free and the backlash is growing. We're talking to one group taking the issue all the way to the White House.</p><p>And you better pack your bags and book yourself a one-way ticket out west because that is where the jobs are. We have a list of the best cities for job growth when we get back. You will be surprised by some of them. Yes, that one is obvious, but we have some surprises too.</p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money?\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether you spent it fetching coffee or doing research or running errand, you probably remember the first internship, but did it ruin the American dream for you?</p><p>Mikey Franklin is cofounder of Fair Pay Campaign and says that unpaid internships are ruing it for everyone. How so?</p><p>MIKEY FRANKLIN, COFOUNDER, FAIR PAY CAMPAIGN: Thank you for having me. Ultimately, the American dream is about opportunity to everyone. And unpaid internships are only open to people that can afford to work for free. If we are really committed to the notion that everyone who works hard should be able to get ahead, we got to make sure that all jobs, including internships, pay a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Mickey, I have to stop you and disagree with you right there. Because I worked two and three jobs during a semester so that I could afford to do unpaid internship in this industry because I wanted to, because I was hungry. You don't have to be rich. You have to be industrious and hungry to work and save the money to go do the internship. I mean, that is part of what it does. It separates out the people who are really focused and driven and the people who won't show up unless you give them money.</p><p>FRANKLIN: But people who have wealthy family to support them, who have independent wealth, they don't have to be hungry or driven. They can just show up anyway.</p><p>FRANCIS: but I think somebody who is hiring interns can smell that. And I mean, as somebody who has interns around all the time, you know the rich kids and then you know kid really focused and want to be there. So I don't think that argument really holds water. You have another one?</p><p>FRANKLIN: We've got plenty of arguments.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FRANKLIN: Another really important argument is that everyone's work has dignity. Everyone's work has value. It has nothing more important teaching people the work they're doing is important. And in this society, the way we do that is by paying them a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think that what an intern is getting not being paid is knowledge. In most cases, interns are not doing work that is worth paying. They're mostly watching and maybe by the end of the summer or the semester they're contributing something. But for the most part, they are not worth paying. So, if you had to pay them you wouldn't have them and that internship would just go away.</p><p>FRANKLIN: You know, Melissa, I speak to hundreds of interns. I was an intern myself. I don't hear from interns saying they were sitting and watching. I hear from interns who say that they were doing substantive and important work.</p><p>Let's take example of interns on production of black swan who sued FOX searchlight successfully. They were not sitting around watching. They were doing important tasks. They were runners on set of the film. They were doing work that needed to be done. So, we are saying they deserved a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think in that case in particular, you know, I mean, they were doing a lot of grunt work and running work and you're right, that that is a type of situation where they would just hire professionals. So, if they're forced to be paid they would have hired someone in the industry. And those kids that were hired in that case would not have gotten that job and wouldn't have gotten a break in the industry.</p><p>I mean, they were doing work for free as way to get into the industry. If that were a paid position, there are about 2,000, 3,000 people in Hollywood that would have gobbled it up. And those interns would not have the opportunity or not gotten into the business.</p><p>FRANKLIN: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question. I mean, of course, I disagree with your, with your assertion.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm saying those two people, would not have gotten that job if it was paid. It would have gone to someone with a resume' who had a background because there are tons of people in Hollywood who want that job.</p><p>So, is that OK with you, that if it is paid, those students who had the job with a break in industry, you don't get a leg up, you don't get the entrance in to the industry? Instead, it goes to somebody already there. Is that OK with you?</p><p>FRANKLIN: That is clearly not going to happen. First of all it wasn't job, it was internship. If it was a job it would be paid.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're saying pay them. That makes it a job, not internship any longer.</p><p>FRANKLIN: The internship, the film industry or the political industry or journalism industry, every industry has to keep on bringing in new people. Every industry needs new talent, new graduates, new workers keen to learn and develop the industry.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not in Hollywood. They have more people than can possibly fill. I mean, they have more people than can fill all jobs they have in Hollywood. No one would ever get a start in Hollywood at this point. I mean, there are so many unemployed people walking around Hollywood. I mean, there are industries that can just afford to do it. the industry is, I mean, that is where the unpaid internships go -</p><p>FRANKLIN: FOX searchlight can afford to do this. FOX searchlight can afford this as every other production company asking can they not? FOX searchlight is part of billion dollar parent company. The notion of they can afford $7.25 an hour --</p><p>FRANCIS: I didn't say they can't afford it. No one ever said that. Of course, they absolutely can afford. But then, no one who is new in the industry would ever get in because you would get somebody who has a resume' would get that job. They can definitely afford it.</p><p>FRANKLIN: But every other industry and every other country where the practice changed demonstrates that is not true, other industries in which these practice is less widespread, particularly tech industry. The big tech organization is hugely competitive to work there. They all pay their interns in fair wage, but they are still attracting and bringing in talented young workers and new staff.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mikey, thanks so much for coming on. We appreciate your thoughts.</p><p>FRANKLIN: Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, is anyone you know looking for a job? Then stick around. We have the top cities across America for job growth. And you won't believe what's on the list.</p><p>And \"who made Money today?\" This pop siren was rolling in the cash when she released her hit album back in 2011. But rumor has it she is still laughing all the way to the bank three years later.</p><p>\"Piles of Money\" coming right up. That is so obvious, come on.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: The top cities or job growth across America, did your town make the list? A new study from the Milken Institute ranks the best places to be, and here with the big reveal is the man behind the report, chief research officer at the Milken Institute, Ross DeVol. We've also got Fortune editor, Adam Lashinsky, who is a Fox News contributor. Thanks to both of you. Ross, let me start with you. What is the number one city on the list?</p><p>ROSS DEVOL, CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER, MILKEN INSTITUTE: It's Austin, and thanks for having me on, Melissa. Austin has been a perennial top performer. It's a city that has both technology, it has low business costs, it has low regulatory environment, and is overall very business friendly, and also is the top university if you receive Texas, Austin.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is it basically all tech jobs? I mean, what's available in Austin?</p><p>DEVOL: It's not all tech jobs, but certainly, the leading growth has been in the technology area. Computer systems analysts, for example, make over $82,000 in Austin substantially above the national average wage for all industries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, I mean, you're a tech guru, is this whole study going to be in your -- anticipation is going to all be about places where computer programmers can get jobs? Is that what the future is?</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Well, it's not only where the future is but where the growth is now. These sorts of studies show where jobs are growing. I've been a witness to what's going on in San Francisco, which you know, interestingly, has none of the things that Ross mentioned with the exception of a vibrant technology business and great universities, but it's not a great business environment.</p><p>It's not a low cost place to live or to hire, and yet, the San Francisco did extremely well on the list for that reason.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true. I mean, it's number three on the list. So, it may be a great place for job growth but it's not where you would necessarily want to move to have those jobs. I mean, the cost of housing, for example, is just a fortune. So, Ross, I mean, do you compensate for that on the list at all?</p><p>DEVOL: Well, no, we don't compensate. We don't measure housing costs. In fact, places that have low housing cost have very low job growth because there's no demand. A person going to a tech job in San Francisco to work for sales for Oracle or Twitter, they're looking for the next breakthrough technology to really hit it, and it's not just about the wages, it's also about stock options to be able to cash-in someday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, and actually, I'll correct you on your own study, because you talk about the cost-of-living. Number two on your list is Provo, Utah and the average cost of living there is eight percent below the national average. So, to me, of all the ones on your list, that seem like sort of the pick of the litter because there's a lot of job growth there, but the cost of living is lower. How is that possible? Ross.</p><p>DEVOL: Well, it's an emerging technologies center. It doesn't have the concentration of technology that Austin, San Jose, or San Francisco has. But it's -- using that university, the Brigham Young University which has been spending out technology firms and working with the companies they have there such as Nuvel (ph) in the software field, and they've been very successful. So, there's no one strategy, there's some low cost, low regulation areas, but you can offset that by being very innovative in places like San Francisco and San Jose.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, what kind of jobs are we talking about here? For people who are out there watching this and are saying, I don't know, maybe I can go and get retrained and learn to do something in a tech industry, because this is where all the jobs are? You know, what kind of jobs are we talking about?</p><p>LASHINSKY: My sense is those aren't the kinds of jobs that Ross is talking about at all, certainly not in San Francisco. What we have here for the second time in my short 15 -- almost 15 years here is a gold rush mentality, right? So, young people in particular looking for their fame and fortune as a metaphor are coming here to do whatever they can do. So, if their computer programmers, they're right in the sweet spot.</p><p>But, when there's so much money slashing around as there is today, everybody else is looking for a way to make a buck on it, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I don't think there's a huge opportunity for retraining, though, to be candid.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, Ross, I mean, does that mean are you better off going to a place like San Francisco where everybody is going to seek their fame and fortune or are you better off going to one of the up and coming cities on this list like Provo, for example? I mean, is there actually more opportunity there because it's a less popular place to go?</p><p>DEVOL: It really depends upon what your motivational factors are. If you really want to be with the best and brightest are and hit it big in the technology area, you have that opportunity, the San Franciscos, the Cambridge Massachusetts, the San Joses, Silicon Valley, and the places you want to be, but there are some sleepers out there --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>DEVOL: -- that are newly emerging technology centers such Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina. You can look at Portland. Seattle is on our list as well in the top 10. So, there's no one prescription, there's no one place to go, but if you're looking for a more family-friendly atmosphere, you know, eventually maybe you want to get married and have kids, A Provo, Salt Lake City are very attractive.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, I mean, what about that? Were you surprised to see Utah twice in the top five?</p><p>LASHINSKY: No. There's always been a vibrant technology seen or at least there has been for the past 20 years. Of course, they have several good universities in the area. And it's close to nature.</p><p>I think it's a place where people enjoy living and I smiled when Ross said about if you want to have a family, that -- for whatever reason, for various reasons, Utah is a very family friendly place, there's no doubt, as someone who is raising a family in San Francisco that San Francisco is a less family friendly place. So, it depends not only --</p><p>FRANCIS: Wait, why is it less family friendly?</p><p>LASHINSKY: It's expensive. The schools are a challenge. You know, to find a place to live is both difficult and extremely expensive. These are all things that make you work harder -- challenges if you want to raise a family in a particular area. I'm not saying you can't do it. I'm doing it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY: But it would be easier to go to a lesser market.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No. I just want to clarify that for audience. They're not hostile to kids. It's that it's really expensive and it's hard to get into school. I don't know or maybe --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LASHINSKY: Some have argued that the city of San Francisco is. There've been studies about how families flee San Francisco as soon as kids get to be school age. I'm not necessarily taking that position, but you're not far off.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, thanks to both of you. A lot of great information there. Appreciate it.</p><p>DEVOL: You're welcome, Melissa. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, forget the year-end bonus, workers want incentive right here, right now. In fact, one study says making employees wait months and months for a bonus can do a company more harm than good. What do you think? Is the once a year bonus keeping you loyal? Watch and tweet me about what you think. Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to go, because at the end of the day, it is all about cold hard cash.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: So, did you start off the brand New Year with a bonus? If you did, was it cold hard cash or a hearty handshake? Companies and employees are ever debating the benefits of the bonus. Is it is a gesture of thanks from employee's hard work or has it become a source of competition and entitlement? And most importantly, at the end of the day, do they even work?</p><p>Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to battle over bonuses. We have Julie Roginsky, Mercedes Colwin, and Jack Burkman. What do you, guys, think? What do you think? Is money a motivator? What do you think, Julie?</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So, I'm a champ, because I always give my assistant a bonus every year --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He'll tell you right now --</p><p>FRANCIS: He knows how much is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: It's kind of like it's gotten to -- he's been with me for 11 years. so, it's gotten to the point where --</p><p>FRANCIS: Something is working. He's been with you for 11 years.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He's just probably -- get another job. Knowing him --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: I know, but actually, why would you? Like, you know, you're getting a bonus on top of your salary. It's got for good (ph) one year. I didn't give him a bonus, he'd be like --</p><p>FRANCIS: He'd be furious.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He'd probably furious. So, you know, I don't know. But I think what's more motivating is actually a hearty thank you. I really do --</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>JACK BURKMAN, RADIO HOST: Oh, come on!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: The bonuses cost -- I don't care if you're talking about Goldman or if you're talking about my little radio show, if you're talking about a restaurant, anything in between, bonuses cost very, very little. Companies get a huge upside for very little money. Worse part of it is if you don't pay it, there's a huge downside, because people expect this at Christmas --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>BURKMAN: -- from my lobbying firm, I mean, I don't know. You spend 10 grand, 15 grand on Christmas. I get a million bucks in upside for spending --</p><p>FRANCIS: How do you measure that? How do you know that?</p><p>BURKMAN: Well, you know it by the way people approach their job. You know it by the way they look when they come in the morning --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, why do it once a year then? Because that's one of the points of this is that maybe the bonus works, but doing it once a year doesn't keep -- people motivated --</p><p>BURKMAN: For tradition.</p><p>FRANCIS: It motivates them in November.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It motivates them in April.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: And that's a big issue. So, if it's only going to be once a year at the end of the year, then suddenly, that last quarter, their behavior is going to get better.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>COLWIN: They're going to be much more industrious. They're going to work a lot harder. Well, you know what, that shouldn't be the case. Start doing it quarterly, start doing it from the beginning. And frankly, it really is generational, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: If you're talking about the folks that -- the new millennials --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: -- they want money.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: If you break it up, the problem is that it's too small and it doesn't have the impact. If you build the excitement and the anticipation, you hit them at the end, anticipation everybody thinks in terms of the holiday bonus whether you're the investment banker that wants to, you know, by the emerald for your girlfriend or whether you're the poor person that needs to pay the tuition, they all wait for that holiday --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It was interesting in this business article. They said, studies have shown that financial incentives are poor motivators. I clicked through on the studies, and it went to like a YouTube video. I don't know what studies --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- that money doesn't (ph) motivate. Julie, money motivates.</p><p>ROGINSKY: No. And I do what I do because I'm a champ, but I think what actually motivates is if you treat your staff well if they do a good job --</p><p>FRANCIS: That actually should be both.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes, you do, but how many people, actually -- and a lot of people I know who work in investment banking, although, they're motivated primarily by money, but people who are not necessarily just motivated by that get offended because they truly hate their bosses. They do what they need to do --</p><p>BURKMAN: But the Christmas bonus makes up for hatred of the bosses.</p><p>ROGINSKY: It does but it doesn't provide the good work ethic that you want because if you're actually -- if you know your boss appreciates you --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you fix that? How do you -- I mean, some of the suggestions are, you know, that you built out a way that they can anticipate what they're going to get based on goals. I mean, do you do that? Do you sort of set expectations --</p><p>BURKMAN: Here's the thing, if you do that, it's easy to say that, but then it becomes part of their salary.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>BURKMAN: In other words, if you say, OK, we're going to split the Christmas bonus into five things, they say, oh, that salary. Now, the holiday is coming, there's no bang. There's no push. So then, it just all becomes salary. You have to -- it's like Henry Ford. You have to play a little bit of psychological game with the workers. It's money, yes, but it's also, you have to kind of trick them. It's psychology.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is so ugly and it's so true. I mean, either of you guys want to disagree with --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: No. I don't practice it, because as I said an (INAUDIBLE), but what you said is --</p><p>BURKMAN: You're just a better person.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes. I kind of --</p><p>COLWIN: I'm a true Democrat. I give it away.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN: The money, nothing else, but yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, it's about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN: Talking about the bonuses. Nothing else.</p><p>FRANCIS: But it is a little bit about that element of surprise, right? I mean, isn't there that game where if you really like an employee, you're trying to anticipate what they think they're going to get and then surprise them a little bit to the upside? Is there a punishment? I mean, do you take the person who is not as good as they should have been and you still give them something but it's less from they anticipated? It's getting a little tricky.</p><p>COLWIN: Yes, it gets tricky, but -- I mean, certainly in our industry. If you're not doing well as a lawyer, you really can't compensate this individual, whether it's a bonus or salary, some other incentives, you really have to have some punitive measure with the attorneys. I think it depends on --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how does the conversation go at Christmas time? I mean, do you bring someone in and you say, I know, you think you're getting a bonus but you're not?</p><p>COLWIN: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Have you done that?</p><p>COLWIN: Absolutely. Unquestionably.</p><p>FRANCIS: Does the person cry? Do they throw things at you? Have you called security --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN: It hasn't gotten that bad, but yes. I mean, they do. They get really upset. And also, they're like, what? I mean, especially lawyers who have a pretty healthy ego. They're like -- you mean, we don't walk on water? We're not the best thing going? How could you not see how brilliant and great I am?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: You got to deal and compete with that ego, too. But no, the bottom line --</p><p>BURKMAN: We run the car business. The family was in the car business. There's an old saying, 20 percent of the salesman make 80 percent of the sales. But what you got to do is you have to highly compensate the producers, quickly weed out (ph) and get rid of everybody else. That's the key to business.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: And bonuses are part --</p><p>ROGINSKY: But to your point, I think if somebody is really bad, you don't not give them a bonus, you just fire them, which I've got to do. If they're not good, you just -- they have to go.</p><p>BURKMAN: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: What about non-monetary things? I mean, is that just a total waste of time and people are looking and they want cash? I mean -- this article as well that said the money doesn't motivate. It's says you could give out gift baskets. I think the employee, he'll get status (ph) like, what did you spend on this and why didn't you just give me the 300 bucks or whatever it is? I mean, isn't that true?</p><p>BURKMAN: Yes. You can't insult them. You know, that's like saying I'm going to give them a book or something for Christmas. You just have to make a quick decision like we've been saying if there -- it's the Henry Ford thing. If they're a good employee, you want them heavily compensated. Bonus is part of that. If not, boot (ph) --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. All right. Wow! Very -- harsh but enlightening. Thanks, you guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, New York is one of the most progressive cities in the world, but when it comes to laundry, it is stuck in the dark ages. Well, forget about slamming it down the Laundromat when innovative businessman is turning your undies into big box. Don't move. You can never have too much MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It's time for a little fun with \"Spare Change.\" It may seem like a simple mundane task, but hardly, anyone loves doing laundry. The concept of paying for pick up isn't new but using your phone for your dirty desk (ph) could be the next big thing. Seth Berkowitz is co-founder of the new service, FlyCleaners, and he hopes this idea is the answer to all your problems.</p><p>So Seth, we were talking about in the commercial break, from the front of my apartment, if I pair off (ph) the window, I can see three different dry cleaners that I could call and they would come over in a second and do my laundry and bring it back. Why do I need your app?</p><p>SETH BERKOWITZ, FLY CLEANERS CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Will they do it at 11 o'clock at night?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: On a Sunday?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: That would be a very big difference.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, I can find any time of day?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, we're open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight seven days a week.</p><p>FRANCIS: And how long does it take for them to get the laundry back?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, we have an instant pick-up model where it will come to your house sometimes within 30 minutes, sometimes less, actually checked the app -- is 26 minutes would have been in my house (ph). But it can be back. The app will keep you posted and we'll be back at your house as soon as the next instant pickup. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, wait. So, you bring it back the next day? I mean, if it's Sunday night and I'm looking to get my, you know, socks picked up. I'm pretty desperate. So, I need it back pretty quick.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: All right. So, for a typical cleaning, for laundry, it can be the same day. If we picked it up on Sunday night, would it be Sunday --</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Monday in afternoon, but for dry cleaning, it could be up to 48 hours.</p><p>FRANCIS: You charge a premium for this?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We don't. We actually have very competitive pricing.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you make money then because the show is called MONEY? I didn't know if you know that. How do you make money?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, there's no brick and mortar model here. This is entirely delivery basing technology. So, we're not paying for retail space on the corner of Broadway and --</p><p>FRANCIS: But if you're charging $0.99 a pound in the dry cleaners or the Laundromat is making part of that money, it's hard for me to imagine that you're making very much money on this.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: There's margin in it. You scale up the business and it can be very successful.</p><p>FRANCIS: You were not a newbie to this business of waving your phone or your iPad and getting something done. You started a very successful business called Insomnia Cookies.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: That's correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: That was based on a similar premise where it's people in the middle of the night who'd just really need a cinnamon oatmeal raisin cookie, and all of a sudden, they need to get their phone out and have it delivered.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's a successful business.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We have 43 locations. We're supposed to open one up tomorrow and six more are coming in the next three months.</p><p>FRANCIS: Forty-three locations around the country?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Correct. Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: There are that many people who need cookies in an instant and didn't buy, you know, the pre-made Pillsbury dough from the grocery store and pop in the oven. That's not good enough. They got to call you on the cookies?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Well, so we have a college business market or we have locations at major college market --</p><p>FRANCIS: -- college kids, they would need cookies --</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Right. Until 3:00 in the morning is the insomnia model. So, that's a pretty robust model (ph) there.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, I imagine, the laundry would be big for them as well?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We like a little bit more of a dense (ph) marketplace. So, New York City, big cities would be better more for FlyCleaners than Insomnia. Although, Insomnia thrives in New York City.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I mean, the laundry -- the only thing about the laundry business is it does seem like something they would only work in New York because we're the only place where you would pay a million dollars for an apartment and still not have a washer and dryer inside.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Not the only one.</p><p>FRANCIS: Where else do you think this would work?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: D.C., Boston, but there are many options. We're not sure exactly yet. We have to continue to iterate our model and see --</p><p>FRANCIS: The cookies were a huge hit. The laundry sounds like a good idea. What's your next idea?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I don't know. it took 10 years to come up with the second one. So, we'll talk in 2020 something.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: How many laundry companies are signed up to work with you right now in New York? I mean, how big is that business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We have partnerships with the number of wholesalers. It's not a huge number.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it's not like the local dry cleaner? It's not like you're farming out their business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: You have like one central place the laundry is going to.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We work with a couple of partner, couple of local partners.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. So, if you lose one of my socks then what? Are you down there looking in the bin for the lost sock that's gone? It's one always goes missing.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: It's true. It's not me, but I mean, FlyCleaners is built on responsibility and tremendous customer service. So, if you lost your sock, you'd e-mail us, we'd pay you back your sock.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh, you'd pay -- you're not going to find it. See, that's honest. You just give me the money for it. No one's going to find --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I've lost a million socks and I've never got anything back for it.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Seth, thank you so much. A lot of fun.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, \"Who Made Money Today?\" The soulful Brit (ph) is still making a ton of money and smashing all kinds of records despite not having an album for three years already. You want to know who it is. Keep watching. You can never have too much MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made Money Today.\" Anyone who owns Constellation Brand, the wine and spirits maker is still benefiting from its buyout of beer (ph) with its latest earnings jumping by more than 90 percent. The company is so optimistic about its American beer sale that it's raised its earnings forecast for the whole year. That what's the appetite of investors everywhere.</p><p>The stock soared more than 9.5 percent. Chief executive, Rob Sands, must be pleased. He owns nearly 3.2 million shares, so he made $21 million today. I'll drink to that.</p><p>And making money for charity. Jay-Z, his controversial clothing line made headlines around the world when his retail collaborator, Barney's, was accused of racial profiling. But that hasn't stopped him from bringing the big box. In fact, it's already made more than million dollars and it all goes -- Beyonce's Sean Carter Foundation which helps out young people that can't afford to go to college. Very nice.</p><p>Making even more money. Stellar musician, Adele, the British soul diva continues to smash records with her hit album 21 nearly three years after its released. Three years. The record has become the first ever digital album to sell more than three million copies. Industry insiders are surprised it was the top-selling album in all of 2011 and 2012, but here's the weird thing, 21 was actually the 21st best-selling album of last year and also the 21st album ever surpass 10 million copies in sales. Kind of creepy, right?</p><p>All right. That's all we've got for you. I hope you made money today. Tune in tomorrow and hear Congressman David Schweikert on the war of economic mobility. It's all wrapped up in the health care -- and it's got everyone talking. That's tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Be sure to set your DVR every day at 5:00 to get your fix of everything MONEY. We will see you back here tomorrow. \"The Willis Report\" is next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Is somebody making money off that?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It beats standing underneath it, I suspect. Yes, actually, we're in the Pilson neighborhood of Chicago. And if you look, that is the polar ice company. And the sign is almost covered with a pile of snow.</p><p>You know what happens when you get temperatures this low, the snow doesn't go anywhere. You just have to keep moving it around. And this is where they moved it here. The seasonal employees are making money moving the snow. That is one way to go in addition to the ice business which continues. You know, they sell dry ice all year-round. Shipments go out. They still have to have ice. Who knew?</p><p>FRANCIS: Will be fine. Why would people be buying giant blocks of ice when there is ice outside? You're saying the business is booming there?</p><p>FLOCK: How about dry ice? These guys supply air France. And so, there are shipments every day going overseas. And so, these guys have to continue to supply that.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FLOCK: And look what they're dealing with outside the ice house. Look what the street looks like.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is ironic.</p><p>FLOCK: Yes, these poor people.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is ironic.</p><p>FLOCK: Pretty funny.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>Joe Calderone, let me ask you. You know, Serendipity 3 I have one of the famous frozen hot chocolates here on set with me. People are still lining up to come in, and have -- there it is, doesn't it look delicious? They're coming in to get frozen hot chocolates in weather like this? I don't believe you.</p><p>JOE CALDERONE, SPOKESPERSON, SERENDIPITY: Yes. No, we sell more, just as many frozen hot chocolates during the winter months that we do during the summer. You know, everybody in the cold weather, everyone wants comfort and what is more comforting than a frozen hot chocolate or bit bowl of ice cream.</p><p>FRANCIS: How about a hot, hot chocolate? I think that would be more comforting. I mean, you kind of led me right to that one, more comforting than frozen hot chocolate in cold weather? I could think of 50 things including hot cookies, coffee, regular hot chocolate. Will they still really line up?</p><p>Now, your story is so famous. I've been down there with my kids and there is huge line in front. You wait forever to get in. Are you telling me in the arctic weather today there were still people lining up in front?</p><p>CALDERONE: Yes, there were still people lining up in front and all coming for the iconic frozen hot chocolate -- frozen.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. That video must not be from today then.</p><p>Dior, let me ask you.</p><p>DIOR ISFANDIYOR, PEDICAB DRIVER: Yes, ma'am.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, after drinking my frozen hot chocolate, the next thing I think I would not do is get in a pedicab to drive around the city, because that would be frozen. Did anyone get in your pedicab today?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Yes, we got a lot of customers today. You know, after drinking hot chocolate I would say, you know, I will take customers, say you like to go dancing and get in the pedicab.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you do to keep them warm in there because, I don't know, there is a little plastic thing on the front there that --?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: This is like going proof Cowell so wind down go inside. There is also like a blanket like I have, I it is like an old blanket Gortex blanket. It consumes like the wind coming inside. That is why is like -- and it goes, it is a little fun to do. People like to do. I mean a lot of people, I think, if somebody don't ride the pedicab in New York City, I would stay they didn't see New York so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>So Dior, you know, my insides were frozen from the frozen hot chocolate and I got inside your pedicab and pedaled around the city to freeze the outside of my body, what would that cost me?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: I mean, you mean like how much it costs?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. What does it cost per minute? What will you charge me to freeze my Tucus off out there?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: We have new regulation. We have in the summertime like $2, $3 per minute the ride. But basically, we give the customers more discount in wintertime because, like you know, more want to ride. So, we give them more --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, did you charge less today? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Yes, like a cab. Also pedicab is like a per minute ride. No additional fees. And like companies gives us receipt so we give them receipt after like -- after finishing the ride.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you mind if I ask you how much money you made today? I mean, how many people actually volunteered to get in that pedicab and go around city?</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Like basically, like, the -- because I rent from the company, so like, basically it is like half and half. Like how much every day you make half for company, half for yourself. And also including the -- you pay taxes also.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, I hate taxes. Don't even get me started on that one. Anyone who watches the show knows about that.</p><p>Joe, let me ask you would you get in his cab and let him drive you back to serendipity 3 or too cold.</p><p>CALDERONE: Sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't believe you.</p><p>CALDERONE: No. I will put my hood on. Sure. It beats walking, that's for sure.</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: Why not?</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys are very good sports. Thank you so much.</p><p>I will enjoy my frozen hot chocolate. Dior, stay there, I will be done in 55 minutes. We'll head uptown, OK.</p><p>ISFANDIYOR: No problem. OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you. And thanks to Jeff Flock as well who I think, you know, is still on top of the ice mountain out there. There he is.</p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p>FLOCK: You're welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: Clearly, it is still freezing out there.</p><p>The last thing you feel like doing is slapping your laundry through the polar vortex to the Laundromat, right? But if you're down to the last pair of socks, I have to be honest you don't have much of a choice until now! We have entrepreneur who is putting the convenience back into the cleaning service industry and offering pretty competitive prices like the Uber-for laundry. He is going to be here with all the not so dirty details. Stick around for some of that coming up in spare change later in the show.</p><p>Up next, it is as cool as it sounds, using Google glass in a crowded parking lot to pinpoint exactly where your car is. Even unlocking and starting it with just a look on a tab. Hyundai is getting Google up and we're going live to Las Vegas for details.</p><p>And the U.S. bobsled team is going for gold in a BMW. It is faster and sleeker than ever before. We're talking the brains behind it all.</p><p>More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: The consumer electronics show is in full swing and today we're talking about an automaker partnering with Google glass. Controversial? Some say yes. One San Diego woman just got pulled over and ticketed for driving while wearing Google glass. Auto companies and Google glass aren't the best of friend. But one car company is standing out from all the rest in its completely embracing it.</p><p>Hyundai announced its new genesis 2015 sedan interacts with the driver through Google glass. Here with all details is Hyundai executive director Barry Ratzlaff and Shelly Palmer is our tech expert who is right next to him to sort of give us his take.</p><p>Barry, let me start with you. Are you concerned at all? I mean, we are talking about somebody just got ticketed. And a lot of people are concerned about safety of pairing drivers with those who are wearing, you know, Google glass?</p><p>BARRY RATZLAFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HYUNDAI: Yes, you know it is a very important point. Let me just start off by saying that driver distraction is extremely important topic and fundamentally people should not play with their smartphones while driving. And in fact, a lot of what we're trying to do here is help solve the issue.</p><p>It is an important point to note that the Google glass app we developed for Hyundai (INAUDIBLE) is intended for use when you are outside the car in pre-drive experience. In fact, we are trying to take some of things you would normally do in the car, save you some time and help you do them before you enter the car.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can I ask you because you obviously have them on. Are you distracted right now? What are you looking at? Are they just clear?</p><p>RATZLAFF: They're clear. I'm looking in at the camera. They're really out of -- they are kind in the periphery of my vision so I can look up to see the screen when I need to, but I concentrate on task at hand without being distracted as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can police tell if you have them on and you're actually using them or if you're just wearing them and like you are and not doing with them?</p><p>RATZLAFF: So, I am actually I have a screen cast here. So, you can see exactly what I'm seeing in my Google glass. This is the genesis app. I can enter the app and just give you a flavor for kind of things we can do. Remote features. Some things like, it is a little bit of lag time here for the display. Sorry. POI surge. We can do dealer search. So, this is exactly what I'm seeing in the screen.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, part of the advertisement was that it can help you find your car if you can't find it in a parking lot, is that right? How does it do that?</p><p>RATZLAFF: Yes. It is.</p><p>So, we -- Blue link has invented cellular modem, built in to the car so we can connect to the car remotely, the owner can. We have got smartphone app, the glass, app from a Web site. You can locate your car. Say, you forgot where you where you park it in airport parking lot or football game in crowded parking lot. Like how many times have you wandered around trying to find the car, we are providing a solution for that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right or if you had too many drinks, it can find your care for you. That is perfect.</p><p>Shelly, what do you think of this? I mean, is this going to be hit?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, TECH EXPERT: This is earl days. First of all, Google glass is not product, it's a concept. And when I look at Google glass helps me look into the future. It tells me nothing about the present. And though apps like this are really awesome because they tell us what we can expect the future, and I mean, the future social logically, not technologically.</p><p>These things that we do now are all about how we, as human beings are going to be exo-digitally enhanced. But what is different here is instead of having to look at my smartphone which I carry with me all the time I have a heads up display. So, human beings with heads up displays -- that is the story here. The idea using that I'm using it to get into the car or out of the car, that's a real question. Distracted driving is the number one worst thing you can do in the world.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>PALMER: So, let's not even start to talk about it. Let's talk -- and you certainly don't need to put on a pair of Google glass to find your car, whether drunk or sober. What you do need to do --</p><p>FRANCIS: That is joke, by the way, obviously.</p><p>PALMER: No, no, no. But it is not a joke, Melissa. It is actually the whole point. The point is that what we have now is we have a heads up display for people. We're tied to our phone. It outsourced our memory and we got, of course, all wave finding. This is how we can see it better. I'm faster at seeing things. I have mine on with --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I was going to ask you that. Are those regular glass or they are Google glass and --</p><p>PALMER: No, this is my glasses with Google glass but I'm seeing notifications. People are texting me, hey, Shelly. I'm getting some tweets right now. So, you're on FOX. It is like, that's awesome. I'm seeing you and seeing that. I don't have to look at my phone to do it. I know I'm getting tweeted.</p><p>FRANCIS: Barry, let me ask you, you know, about crossover of two these two products here because Google glass, you know, is really marketed to someone who spends a lot of money, is pretty tech-savvy and is relatively high-end. I think of Hyundai buyers as being, you know, very focused on a bargain and good deal. I'm not sure there is a lot of crossover between those two markets.</p><p>RATZLAFF: You know, Shelly, Melissa, you couldn't have given me a better setup. On Monday at the Detroit auto show we are going to announce the next version of our Hyundai Genesis. It is premium rear wheel drive sedan aimed at up market customers. And yes, we're still a value brand. You get a lot of car for your money. But it is fantastic premium product and it is the first vehicle that we're using to launch our generation (INAUDIBLE) platform which allows to do great stuff like the Google glass app.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, guys, thank you so much. Send me your glasses. I need to try those out.</p><p>BMW is going for the gold. The U.S. Olympic team has not won a gold medal in the bobsled race in 78 years. But BMW is hoping to help turn that around. The automaker designed a brand new high-speed sled for team USA this year. Will it win?</p><p>Here now is the president and CEO of BMW North America, Ludwig Willisch.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LUDWIG WILLISCH, PRESIDENT, CEO, BMW NORTH AMERICA: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it is going to win?</p><p>WILLISCH: Sure. That's we are. They're going for gold.</p><p>FRANCIS: What makes the bobsled special?</p><p>WILLISCH: We designed it from scratch. And you know, we can do best is build fast, dynamic vehicles except this time it doesn't have wheels.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>WILLISCH: So we started building it as I said from scratch with carbon fiber body as it has minimum weight, we could play around with the center of gravity as we like, as we started building the sled as we need it. And we also went to put it into a wind tunnel. It is really top of the art --</p><p>FRANCIS: Have you done this before?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, we haven't. But we have California-based company called Design Works that can design basically everything. And the designer that actually has done the sled used to design race cars.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: So, he was up for the challenge and that's what it is.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is that a lot of pressure? Because if we lose, I am going to blame you.</p><p>WILLISCH: Go ahead.</p><p>FRANCIS: No -</p><p>WILLISCH: We're really confident. Just look at the track record so far. This season we've had four gold medals, five silver, five bronze. So we're knocking it out of the park.</p><p>FRANCIS: You talked about the carbon fiber body. And obviously, that is technology that a lot of people are fascinated with, that is new, that is very much state-of-the-art. Has that been done before with bobsleds?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, it hasn't. But we have leveraged our knowledge from our new BMW I brand that these cars are made out of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. And so, we're building cars with that material.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: And we could actually, you know, use our knowledge and put, go right ahead and build a body like we were.</p><p>FRANCIS: The show is called \"Money.\" So I have to ask you about the dollars of all this. Did they pay you or is this about product --?</p><p>WILLISCH: No, this is part of our support for the BMW, for the U.S. Olympic team. We supported them during the Olympics in London two years ago. And now we're supporting them for the winter Olympics. That is part of our commitment to the U.S.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you pay for the sponsorship and you also provide the bobsled.</p><p>WILLISCH: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Did they give you discount on sponsorship because you give them the equipment they really need?</p><p>WILLISCH: They love the bobsled.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I was kind of kidding and kind of not.</p><p>What is the process of designing the bobsled? I mean, how involved were the actual athletes themselves? Did they test it? Tell me about the process.</p><p>WILLISCH: Yes, absolutely. I mean, first of all, we looked what was around so far. Then we went to the drawing board and said, what would a optimal sled look like? And, put it into the wind tunnel knew what regulations were. And then, of course, had some prototypes that we tested and we made changes. But we knew what it would be all about, what was necessary to make the thing fast.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WILLISCH: Which we, anyway, know how to make things fast.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're a German company. Why are you doing this for the U.S.A. instead of Germany?</p><p>WILLISCH: Well, as our chairman has said quite a while ago, U.S. is our second home and we've been committed to the U.S. for more than 40 years. So, that what's we do here.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, thank you so much. A lot of fun! We look forward to seeing that.</p><p>All right, coming up, are unpaid internships ruining the American dream? More and more young people are expected to work for free and the backlash is growing. We're talking to one group taking the issue all the way to the White House.</p><p>And you better pack your bags and book yourself a one-way ticket out west because that is where the jobs are. We have a list of the best cities for job growth when we get back. You will be surprised by some of them. Yes, that one is obvious, but we have some surprises too.</p><p>Do you ever have too much \"Money?\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether you spent it fetching coffee or doing research or running errand, you probably remember the first internship, but did it ruin the American dream for you?</p><p>Mikey Franklin is cofounder of Fair Pay Campaign and says that unpaid internships are ruing it for everyone. How so?</p><p>MIKEY FRANKLIN, COFOUNDER, FAIR PAY CAMPAIGN: Thank you for having me. Ultimately, the American dream is about opportunity to everyone. And unpaid internships are only open to people that can afford to work for free. If we are really committed to the notion that everyone who works hard should be able to get ahead, we got to make sure that all jobs, including internships, pay a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Mickey, I have to stop you and disagree with you right there. Because I worked two and three jobs during a semester so that I could afford to do unpaid internship in this industry because I wanted to, because I was hungry. You don't have to be rich. You have to be industrious and hungry to work and save the money to go do the internship. I mean, that is part of what it does. It separates out the people who are really focused and driven and the people who won't show up unless you give them money.</p><p>FRANKLIN: But people who have wealthy family to support them, who have independent wealth, they don't have to be hungry or driven. They can just show up anyway.</p><p>FRANCIS: but I think somebody who is hiring interns can smell that. And I mean, as somebody who has interns around all the time, you know the rich kids and then you know kid really focused and want to be there. So I don't think that argument really holds water. You have another one?</p><p>FRANKLIN: We've got plenty of arguments.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FRANKLIN: Another really important argument is that everyone's work has dignity. Everyone's work has value. It has nothing more important teaching people the work they're doing is important. And in this society, the way we do that is by paying them a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think that what an intern is getting not being paid is knowledge. In most cases, interns are not doing work that is worth paying. They're mostly watching and maybe by the end of the summer or the semester they're contributing something. But for the most part, they are not worth paying. So, if you had to pay them you wouldn't have them and that internship would just go away.</p><p>FRANKLIN: You know, Melissa, I speak to hundreds of interns. I was an intern myself. I don't hear from interns saying they were sitting and watching. I hear from interns who say that they were doing substantive and important work.</p><p>Let's take example of interns on production of black swan who sued FOX searchlight successfully. They were not sitting around watching. They were doing important tasks. They were runners on set of the film. They were doing work that needed to be done. So, we are saying they deserved a wage.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think in that case in particular, you know, I mean, they were doing a lot of grunt work and running work and you're right, that that is a type of situation where they would just hire professionals. So, if they're forced to be paid they would have hired someone in the industry. And those kids that were hired in that case would not have gotten that job and wouldn't have gotten a break in the industry.</p><p>I mean, they were doing work for free as way to get into the industry. If that were a paid position, there are about 2,000, 3,000 people in Hollywood that would have gobbled it up. And those interns would not have the opportunity or not gotten into the business.</p><p>FRANKLIN: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question. I mean, of course, I disagree with your, with your assertion.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm saying those two people, would not have gotten that job if it was paid. It would have gone to someone with a resume' who had a background because there are tons of people in Hollywood who want that job.</p><p>So, is that OK with you, that if it is paid, those students who had the job with a break in industry, you don't get a leg up, you don't get the entrance in to the industry? Instead, it goes to somebody already there. Is that OK with you?</p><p>FRANKLIN: That is clearly not going to happen. First of all it wasn't job, it was internship. If it was a job it would be paid.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're saying pay them. That makes it a job, not internship any longer.</p><p>FRANKLIN: The internship, the film industry or the political industry or journalism industry, every industry has to keep on bringing in new people. Every industry needs new talent, new graduates, new workers keen to learn and develop the industry.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not in Hollywood. They have more people than can possibly fill. I mean, they have more people than can fill all jobs they have in Hollywood. No one would ever get a start in Hollywood at this point. I mean, there are so many unemployed people walking around Hollywood. I mean, there are industries that can just afford to do it. the industry is, I mean, that is where the unpaid internships go -</p><p>FRANKLIN: FOX searchlight can afford to do this. FOX searchlight can afford this as every other production company asking can they not? FOX searchlight is part of billion dollar parent company. The notion of they can afford $7.25 an hour --</p><p>FRANCIS: I didn't say they can't afford it. No one ever said that. Of course, they absolutely can afford. But then, no one who is new in the industry would ever get in because you would get somebody who has a resume' would get that job. They can definitely afford it.</p><p>FRANKLIN: But every other industry and every other country where the practice changed demonstrates that is not true, other industries in which these practice is less widespread, particularly tech industry. The big tech organization is hugely competitive to work there. They all pay their interns in fair wage, but they are still attracting and bringing in talented young workers and new staff.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mikey, thanks so much for coming on. We appreciate your thoughts.</p><p>FRANKLIN: Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, is anyone you know looking for a job? Then stick around. We have the top cities across America for job growth. And you won't believe what's on the list.</p><p>And \"who made Money today?\" This pop siren was rolling in the cash when she released her hit album back in 2011. But rumor has it she is still laughing all the way to the bank three years later.</p><p>\"Piles of Money\" coming right up. That is so obvious, come on.</p><p>FRANCIS: The top cities or job growth across America, did your town make the list? A new study from the Milken Institute ranks the best places to be, and here with the big reveal is the man behind the report, chief research officer at the Milken Institute, Ross DeVol. We've also got Fortune editor, Adam Lashinsky, who is a Fox News contributor. Thanks to both of you. Ross, let me start with you. What is the number one city on the list?</p><p>ROSS DEVOL, CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER, MILKEN INSTITUTE: It's Austin, and thanks for having me on, Melissa. Austin has been a perennial top performer. It's a city that has both technology, it has low business costs, it has low regulatory environment, and is overall very business friendly, and also is the top university if you receive Texas, Austin.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is it basically all tech jobs? I mean, what's available in Austin?</p><p>DEVOL: It's not all tech jobs, but certainly, the leading growth has been in the technology area. Computer systems analysts, for example, make over $82,000 in Austin substantially above the national average wage for all industries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, I mean, you're a tech guru, is this whole study going to be in your -- anticipation is going to all be about places where computer programmers can get jobs? Is that what the future is?</p><p>ADAM LASHINSKY, FORTUNE SENIOR EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Well, it's not only where the future is but where the growth is now. These sorts of studies show where jobs are growing. I've been a witness to what's going on in San Francisco, which you know, interestingly, has none of the things that Ross mentioned with the exception of a vibrant technology business and great universities, but it's not a great business environment.</p><p>It's not a low cost place to live or to hire, and yet, the San Francisco did extremely well on the list for that reason.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true. I mean, it's number three on the list. So, it may be a great place for job growth but it's not where you would necessarily want to move to have those jobs. I mean, the cost of housing, for example, is just a fortune. So, Ross, I mean, do you compensate for that on the list at all?</p><p>DEVOL: Well, no, we don't compensate. We don't measure housing costs. In fact, places that have low housing cost have very low job growth because there's no demand. A person going to a tech job in San Francisco to work for sales for Oracle or Twitter, they're looking for the next breakthrough technology to really hit it, and it's not just about the wages, it's also about stock options to be able to cash-in someday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, and actually, I'll correct you on your own study, because you talk about the cost-of-living. Number two on your list is Provo, Utah and the average cost of living there is eight percent below the national average. So, to me, of all the ones on your list, that seem like sort of the pick of the litter because there's a lot of job growth there, but the cost of living is lower. How is that possible? Ross.</p><p>DEVOL: Well, it's an emerging technologies center. It doesn't have the concentration of technology that Austin, San Jose, or San Francisco has. But it's -- using that university, the Brigham Young University which has been spending out technology firms and working with the companies they have there such as Nuvel (ph) in the software field, and they've been very successful. So, there's no one strategy, there's some low cost, low regulation areas, but you can offset that by being very innovative in places like San Francisco and San Jose.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, what kind of jobs are we talking about here? For people who are out there watching this and are saying, I don't know, maybe I can go and get retrained and learn to do something in a tech industry, because this is where all the jobs are? You know, what kind of jobs are we talking about?</p><p>LASHINSKY: My sense is those aren't the kinds of jobs that Ross is talking about at all, certainly not in San Francisco. What we have here for the second time in my short 15 -- almost 15 years here is a gold rush mentality, right? So, young people in particular looking for their fame and fortune as a metaphor are coming here to do whatever they can do. So, if their computer programmers, they're right in the sweet spot.</p><p>But, when there's so much money slashing around as there is today, everybody else is looking for a way to make a buck on it, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I don't think there's a huge opportunity for retraining, though, to be candid.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, Ross, I mean, does that mean are you better off going to a place like San Francisco where everybody is going to seek their fame and fortune or are you better off going to one of the up and coming cities on this list like Provo, for example? I mean, is there actually more opportunity there because it's a less popular place to go?</p><p>DEVOL: It really depends upon what your motivational factors are. If you really want to be with the best and brightest are and hit it big in the technology area, you have that opportunity, the San Franciscos, the Cambridge Massachusetts, the San Joses, Silicon Valley, and the places you want to be, but there are some sleepers out there --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>DEVOL: -- that are newly emerging technology centers such Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina. You can look at Portland. Seattle is on our list as well in the top 10. So, there's no one prescription, there's no one place to go, but if you're looking for a more family-friendly atmosphere, you know, eventually maybe you want to get married and have kids, A Provo, Salt Lake City are very attractive.</p><p>FRANCIS: Adam, I mean, what about that? Were you surprised to see Utah twice in the top five?</p><p>LASHINSKY: No. There's always been a vibrant technology seen or at least there has been for the past 20 years. Of course, they have several good universities in the area. And it's close to nature.</p><p>I think it's a place where people enjoy living and I smiled when Ross said about if you want to have a family, that -- for whatever reason, for various reasons, Utah is a very family friendly place, there's no doubt, as someone who is raising a family in San Francisco that San Francisco is a less family friendly place. So, it depends not only --</p><p>FRANCIS: Wait, why is it less family friendly?</p><p>LASHINSKY: It's expensive. The schools are a challenge. You know, to find a place to live is both difficult and extremely expensive. These are all things that make you work harder -- challenges if you want to raise a family in a particular area. I'm not saying you can't do it. I'm doing it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>LASHINSKY: But it would be easier to go to a lesser market.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No. I just want to clarify that for audience. They're not hostile to kids. It's that it's really expensive and it's hard to get into school. I don't know or maybe --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LASHINSKY: Some have argued that the city of San Francisco is. There've been studies about how families flee San Francisco as soon as kids get to be school age. I'm not necessarily taking that position, but you're not far off.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Guys, thanks to both of you. A lot of great information there. Appreciate it.</p><p>DEVOL: You're welcome, Melissa. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, forget the year-end bonus, workers want incentive right here, right now. In fact, one study says making employees wait months and months for a bonus can do a company more harm than good. What do you think? Is the once a year bonus keeping you loyal? Watch and tweet me about what you think. Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to go, because at the end of the day, it is all about cold hard cash.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, did you start off the brand New Year with a bonus? If you did, was it cold hard cash or a hearty handshake? Companies and employees are ever debating the benefits of the bonus. Is it is a gesture of thanks from employee's hard work or has it become a source of competition and entitlement? And most importantly, at the end of the day, do they even work?</p><p>Our \"Money Talker\" panel is ready to battle over bonuses. We have Julie Roginsky, Mercedes Colwin, and Jack Burkman. What do you, guys, think? What do you think? Is money a motivator? What do you think, Julie?</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So, I'm a champ, because I always give my assistant a bonus every year --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He'll tell you right now --</p><p>FRANCIS: He knows how much is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: It's kind of like it's gotten to -- he's been with me for 11 years. so, it's gotten to the point where --</p><p>FRANCIS: Something is working. He's been with you for 11 years.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He's just probably -- get another job. Knowing him --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: I know, but actually, why would you? Like, you know, you're getting a bonus on top of your salary. It's got for good (ph) one year. I didn't give him a bonus, he'd be like --</p><p>FRANCIS: He'd be furious.</p><p>ROGINSKY: He'd probably furious. So, you know, I don't know. But I think what's more motivating is actually a hearty thank you. I really do --</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>JACK BURKMAN, RADIO HOST: Oh, come on!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: The bonuses cost -- I don't care if you're talking about Goldman or if you're talking about my little radio show, if you're talking about a restaurant, anything in between, bonuses cost very, very little. Companies get a huge upside for very little money. Worse part of it is if you don't pay it, there's a huge downside, because people expect this at Christmas --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>BURKMAN: -- from my lobbying firm, I mean, I don't know. You spend 10 grand, 15 grand on Christmas. I get a million bucks in upside for spending --</p><p>FRANCIS: How do you measure that? How do you know that?</p><p>BURKMAN: Well, you know it by the way people approach their job. You know it by the way they look when they come in the morning --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, why do it once a year then? Because that's one of the points of this is that maybe the bonus works, but doing it once a year doesn't keep -- people motivated --</p><p>BURKMAN: For tradition.</p><p>FRANCIS: It motivates them in November.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It motivates them in April.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: And that's a big issue. So, if it's only going to be once a year at the end of the year, then suddenly, that last quarter, their behavior is going to get better.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>COLWIN: They're going to be much more industrious. They're going to work a lot harder. Well, you know what, that shouldn't be the case. Start doing it quarterly, start doing it from the beginning. And frankly, it really is generational, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: If you're talking about the folks that -- the new millennials --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: -- they want money.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: If you break it up, the problem is that it's too small and it doesn't have the impact. If you build the excitement and the anticipation, you hit them at the end, anticipation everybody thinks in terms of the holiday bonus whether you're the investment banker that wants to, you know, by the emerald for your girlfriend or whether you're the poor person that needs to pay the tuition, they all wait for that holiday --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It was interesting in this business article. They said, studies have shown that financial incentives are poor motivators. I clicked through on the studies, and it went to like a YouTube video. I don't know what studies --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- that money doesn't (ph) motivate. Julie, money motivates.</p><p>ROGINSKY: No. And I do what I do because I'm a champ, but I think what actually motivates is if you treat your staff well if they do a good job --</p><p>FRANCIS: That actually should be both.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes, you do, but how many people, actually -- and a lot of people I know who work in investment banking, although, they're motivated primarily by money, but people who are not necessarily just motivated by that get offended because they truly hate their bosses. They do what they need to do --</p><p>BURKMAN: But the Christmas bonus makes up for hatred of the bosses.</p><p>ROGINSKY: It does but it doesn't provide the good work ethic that you want because if you're actually -- if you know your boss appreciates you --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you fix that? How do you -- I mean, some of the suggestions are, you know, that you built out a way that they can anticipate what they're going to get based on goals. I mean, do you do that? Do you sort of set expectations --</p><p>BURKMAN: Here's the thing, if you do that, it's easy to say that, but then it becomes part of their salary.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>BURKMAN: In other words, if you say, OK, we're going to split the Christmas bonus into five things, they say, oh, that salary. Now, the holiday is coming, there's no bang. There's no push. So then, it just all becomes salary. You have to -- it's like Henry Ford. You have to play a little bit of psychological game with the workers. It's money, yes, but it's also, you have to kind of trick them. It's psychology.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is so ugly and it's so true. I mean, either of you guys want to disagree with --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: No. I don't practice it, because as I said an (INAUDIBLE), but what you said is --</p><p>BURKMAN: You're just a better person.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yes. I kind of --</p><p>COLWIN: I'm a true Democrat. I give it away.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN: The money, nothing else, but yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, it's about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN: Talking about the bonuses. Nothing else.</p><p>FRANCIS: But it is a little bit about that element of surprise, right? I mean, isn't there that game where if you really like an employee, you're trying to anticipate what they think they're going to get and then surprise them a little bit to the upside? Is there a punishment? I mean, do you take the person who is not as good as they should have been and you still give them something but it's less from they anticipated? It's getting a little tricky.</p><p>COLWIN: Yes, it gets tricky, but -- I mean, certainly in our industry. If you're not doing well as a lawyer, you really can't compensate this individual, whether it's a bonus or salary, some other incentives, you really have to have some punitive measure with the attorneys. I think it depends on --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how does the conversation go at Christmas time? I mean, do you bring someone in and you say, I know, you think you're getting a bonus but you're not?</p><p>COLWIN: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Have you done that?</p><p>COLWIN: Absolutely. Unquestionably.</p><p>FRANCIS: Does the person cry? Do they throw things at you? Have you called security --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COLWIN: It hasn't gotten that bad, but yes. I mean, they do. They get really upset. And also, they're like, what? I mean, especially lawyers who have a pretty healthy ego. They're like -- you mean, we don't walk on water? We're not the best thing going? How could you not see how brilliant and great I am?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>COLWIN: You got to deal and compete with that ego, too. But no, the bottom line --</p><p>BURKMAN: We run the car business. The family was in the car business. There's an old saying, 20 percent of the salesman make 80 percent of the sales. But what you got to do is you have to highly compensate the producers, quickly weed out (ph) and get rid of everybody else. That's the key to business.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKMAN: And bonuses are part --</p><p>ROGINSKY: But to your point, I think if somebody is really bad, you don't not give them a bonus, you just fire them, which I've got to do. If they're not good, you just -- they have to go.</p><p>BURKMAN: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: What about non-monetary things? I mean, is that just a total waste of time and people are looking and they want cash? I mean -- this article as well that said the money doesn't motivate. It's says you could give out gift baskets. I think the employee, he'll get status (ph) like, what did you spend on this and why didn't you just give me the 300 bucks or whatever it is? I mean, isn't that true?</p><p>BURKMAN: Yes. You can't insult them. You know, that's like saying I'm going to give them a book or something for Christmas. You just have to make a quick decision like we've been saying if there -- it's the Henry Ford thing. If they're a good employee, you want them heavily compensated. Bonus is part of that. If not, boot (ph) --</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. All right. Wow! Very -- harsh but enlightening. Thanks, you guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Coming up, New York is one of the most progressive cities in the world, but when it comes to laundry, it is stuck in the dark ages. Well, forget about slamming it down the Laundromat when innovative businessman is turning your undies into big box. Don't move. You can never have too much MONEY.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's time for a little fun with \"Spare Change.\" It may seem like a simple mundane task, but hardly, anyone loves doing laundry. The concept of paying for pick up isn't new but using your phone for your dirty desk (ph) could be the next big thing. Seth Berkowitz is co-founder of the new service, FlyCleaners, and he hopes this idea is the answer to all your problems.</p><p>So Seth, we were talking about in the commercial break, from the front of my apartment, if I pair off (ph) the window, I can see three different dry cleaners that I could call and they would come over in a second and do my laundry and bring it back. Why do I need your app?</p><p>SETH BERKOWITZ, FLY CLEANERS CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Will they do it at 11 o'clock at night?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: On a Sunday?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: That would be a very big difference.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So, I can find any time of day?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, we're open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight seven days a week.</p><p>FRANCIS: And how long does it take for them to get the laundry back?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, we have an instant pick-up model where it will come to your house sometimes within 30 minutes, sometimes less, actually checked the app -- is 26 minutes would have been in my house (ph). But it can be back. The app will keep you posted and we'll be back at your house as soon as the next instant pickup. So --</p><p>FRANCIS: So, wait. So, you bring it back the next day? I mean, if it's Sunday night and I'm looking to get my, you know, socks picked up. I'm pretty desperate. So, I need it back pretty quick.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: All right. So, for a typical cleaning, for laundry, it can be the same day. If we picked it up on Sunday night, would it be Sunday --</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Monday in afternoon, but for dry cleaning, it could be up to 48 hours.</p><p>FRANCIS: You charge a premium for this?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We don't. We actually have very competitive pricing.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you make money then because the show is called MONEY? I didn't know if you know that. How do you make money?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: So, there's no brick and mortar model here. This is entirely delivery basing technology. So, we're not paying for retail space on the corner of Broadway and --</p><p>FRANCIS: But if you're charging $0.99 a pound in the dry cleaners or the Laundromat is making part of that money, it's hard for me to imagine that you're making very much money on this.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: There's margin in it. You scale up the business and it can be very successful.</p><p>FRANCIS: You were not a newbie to this business of waving your phone or your iPad and getting something done. You started a very successful business called Insomnia Cookies.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: That's correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: That was based on a similar premise where it's people in the middle of the night who'd just really need a cinnamon oatmeal raisin cookie, and all of a sudden, they need to get their phone out and have it delivered.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's a successful business.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We have 43 locations. We're supposed to open one up tomorrow and six more are coming in the next three months.</p><p>FRANCIS: Forty-three locations around the country?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Correct. Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: There are that many people who need cookies in an instant and didn't buy, you know, the pre-made Pillsbury dough from the grocery store and pop in the oven. That's not good enough. They got to call you on the cookies?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Well, so we have a college business market or we have locations at major college market --</p><p>FRANCIS: -- college kids, they would need cookies --</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Right. Until 3:00 in the morning is the insomnia model. So, that's a pretty robust model (ph) there.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, I imagine, the laundry would be big for them as well?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We like a little bit more of a dense (ph) marketplace. So, New York City, big cities would be better more for FlyCleaners than Insomnia. Although, Insomnia thrives in New York City.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I mean, the laundry -- the only thing about the laundry business is it does seem like something they would only work in New York because we're the only place where you would pay a million dollars for an apartment and still not have a washer and dryer inside.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: Not the only one.</p><p>FRANCIS: Where else do you think this would work?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: D.C., Boston, but there are many options. We're not sure exactly yet. We have to continue to iterate our model and see --</p><p>FRANCIS: The cookies were a huge hit. The laundry sounds like a good idea. What's your next idea?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I don't know. it took 10 years to come up with the second one. So, we'll talk in 2020 something.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: How many laundry companies are signed up to work with you right now in New York? I mean, how big is that business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We have partnerships with the number of wholesalers. It's not a huge number.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, it's not like the local dry cleaner? It's not like you're farming out their business?</p><p>BERKOWITZ: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: You have like one central place the laundry is going to.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: We work with a couple of partner, couple of local partners.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. So, if you lose one of my socks then what? Are you down there looking in the bin for the lost sock that's gone? It's one always goes missing.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: It's true. It's not me, but I mean, FlyCleaners is built on responsibility and tremendous customer service. So, if you lost your sock, you'd e-mail us, we'd pay you back your sock.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh, you'd pay -- you're not going to find it. See, that's honest. You just give me the money for it. No one's going to find --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I've lost a million socks and I've never got anything back for it.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Seth, thank you so much. A lot of fun.</p><p>BERKOWITZ: I appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, \"Who Made Money Today?\" The soulful Brit (ph) is still making a ton of money and smashing all kinds of records despite not having an album for three years already. You want to know who it is. Keep watching. You can never have too much MONEY.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made Money Today.\" Anyone who owns Constellation Brand, the wine and spirits maker is still benefiting from its buyout of beer (ph) with its latest earnings jumping by more than 90 percent. The company is so optimistic about its American beer sale that it's raised its earnings forecast for the whole year. That what's the appetite of investors everywhere.</p><p>The stock soared more than 9.5 percent. Chief executive, Rob Sands, must be pleased. He owns nearly 3.2 million shares, so he made $21 million today. I'll drink to that.</p><p>And making money for charity. Jay-Z, his controversial clothing line made headlines around the world when his retail collaborator, Barney's, was accused of racial profiling. But that hasn't stopped him from bringing the big box. In fact, it's already made more than million dollars and it all goes -- Beyonce's Sean Carter Foundation which helps out young people that can't afford to go to college. Very nice.</p><p>Making even more money. Stellar musician, Adele, the British soul diva continues to smash records with her hit album 21 nearly three years after its released. Three years. The record has become the first ever digital album to sell more than three million copies. Industry insiders are surprised it was the top-selling album in all of 2011 and 2012, but here's the weird thing, 21 was actually the 21st best-selling album of last year and also the 21st album ever surpass 10 million copies in sales. Kind of creepy, right?</p><p>All right. That's all we've got for you. I hope you made money today. Tune in tomorrow and hear Congressman David Schweikert on the war of economic mobility. It's all wrapped up in the health care -- and it's got everyone talking. That's tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Be sure to set your DVR every day at 5:00 to get your fix of everything MONEY. We will see you back here tomorrow. \"The Willis Report\" is next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014010801cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B7R-VWG1-DXH2-63DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 8, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Copyright Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzM3NEE0Qjk0NzRCNDhFM0E0NjM2RTE4M0QzNTczMTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Audio Home Recording Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDlGM0MxNkNDQzMxNEQxRDlCRUVDQ0FEODE1Qzk4RTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjExMjFGQzQ0RDI3NEVENzgyREMwMzBGOEI0RTJEMzI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009FPS</classCode><className>SEASONAL WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097F8</classCode><className>BOTTLED WATER &amp; ICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097FB</classCode><className>ICE CREAM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It is newest wave in comparison shopping and the Web site METABID (ph) giving people chance to evaluate offers from doctors across the country and then travel to get the care of their choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to discuss how it all works, the president, Ralph Weber.</p><p>Ralph, what is the experience, I go online what happens?</p><p>RALPH WEBER, PRESIDENT, METABID: Well, you go online and make a request. Now, it depend if you work for employer that uses met at that bid as source care or just an individual. So, you make a request and you can put in your parameters, a few health questions, you know, your height, your weight, any medication allergies. You can put in how far you're willing to travel, if at all. And then you request a bid. You can review all the doctors' profiles. So you see where they went to medical school, what their training was, what their experience is. How many of these procedures they do every year. So you really get to see a lot about the quality of the doctor, as you make the request.</p><p>FRANCIS: wow.</p><p>WEBER: --which with traditional insurance, all you know is in network or out of network.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. You really don't know that much. I mean, although you are able to ask people in your community, generally, especially if your community is smaller that everybody sort of knows everybody. I have a lot of questions about all that.</p><p>OK. So, if I'm an individual do I have to join and pay a fee in order to go look at my employer is not a member?</p><p>WEBER: Yes, if your employer is not a member, you can pay $25 just for one request or join $4.95 per month. And then $4.95 per month is a one-year commitment and then you can go on anytime you like to make a request.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you know, the biggest question, I'm sure, that everyone in the audience has what kind of doctors do you have on the network? I mean, does it include everyone? Is it just a small group? I mean, what percentage would you say of the doctors in America are available in your Web site?</p><p>WEBER: Well, not a huge percentage. We look for doctors that are not the mainstream big box type of providers. Doctors prefer getting cash at the time of care. The traditional insurance model where they will, you know, charge one price that is called the charge master. And then they carry a re-prices it to the allowable, and then they're paid a portion of that. It sometimes takes 120 days or so for them to get their money. So, the doctors like getting paid at the time of the care. And also they get to set their own prices.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: With traditional insurance they're told what they would be paid that is it.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that is interesting. They get to set their own prices to see what the market will bear. A lot of our viewers tweeted in and said, you know, it is very normal for people to travel to Sloane Kettering or to travel to MD Anderson for cancer treatment. So, they're familiar with the idea of traveling to big. Do you have big names like that on your site?</p><p>WEBER: Yes. As a matter of fact, we do Baylor in Houston, MD Anderson is participating on very small level. We have talked to Kerlin Jobe in Los Angeles. They kind of were looking at it. They haven't made a final evaluation. So absolutely, and we have overseas facility like in (INAUDIBLE) and Bangkok.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let me ask you about how some financials work, OK. So, say I get to -- the doctor looks great online, you know, I look at it -- for whatever you can tell. I mean, have the same problem when I'm on my own health network and you are looking, you see their education. But until you go see them, you don't really know them. So, say you get out there and you meet them or you see hospital and don't feel good about it. What happens then? Do you lose the travel money? How do the financials work?</p><p>WEBER: OK, well, I mean, if you paid for your own flight, then, yes, I mean you've had sort of two-day vacation I guess or whatever. I mean, it is not much different than if you looked in the yellow pages and went to MD Anderson or the local, you know, corner hospital either way. I mean, if you get there, you don't like the physician for whatever reason.</p><p>Now keep in mind you've had a lot of transactions before you get to there. A lot of doctors when they respond to a bid they will say, OK, you know, before we go through this, maybe we should have a phone call or talk on Skype or something like that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: So usually by the time you get there you've actually kind of met the person, sort of online.</p><p>FRANCIS: And how does insurance play into this? Because there a couple of articles that I was reading about this, they were saying that in some cases your insurance company will pay for to you fly to another place if it is significantly cheaper for then. How do you get your insurance company involved in shopping for prices?</p><p>WEBER: Well, a lot of people use private third party administrators where they have more flexibility and it has to be right in the plan document where it will allow. Some of the big carriers won't actually allow you to negotiate a better price without considering it out of network which means you pay more of a deductible. So, you have to make sure your plan is set up to wraparound this kind of travel arrangement.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: I mean, if you're getting a knee replacement for 21,000 versus 70, it would be foolish for the carrier not to cover. So, it was self- funded employers where they can do this.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is the most common type of surgery people are traveling for? What do you see the most? Because I imagine it isn't emergency surgery where people are price comparing.</p><p>WEBER: No. That is true. Our app is not quite fast enough to work in the ambulance.</p><p>A lot of people are using knee replacement, hip replacement, colonoscopies. Those are some of our more common. Rotator cuff repair, we are getting a lot of requests for cosmetic procedures. But I think orthopedic would be the most common surgery because they're mostly preplanned.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>No, it's a very interesting model because of course we're going through these dramatic changes in health care. People are trying to figure out, you know, as they're forced to bear more of a burden of the cost, how they can make it cheaper for themselves. Here in New York a lot of doctors stopped taking insurance all together and gone to all cash because the system is so hard to deal with.</p><p>WEBER: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, an application like yours I can see it gaining a lot of popularity as people, you know, realize they're really out there on their own trying to fend for themselves.</p><p>Ralph Weber, great stuff, thank you so much. Very interesting.</p><p>WEBER: And it is not just about price though, Melissa. It is not just about price. I mean, when you go to hotels.com, you don't look for a motel 6. It is sometimes about access. Sometimes crossing a state line, different medical board has different medical regulations with drastically can increase or decrease the cost. So, it is about accessing and choice and getting the doctor that you want rather than the one that covers you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, that is a great point. I'm glad you added that.</p><p>Ralph, I think it is the wave of the future. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>WEBER: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, it won't be long before we're all driving i-cars. Who can help Apple win the race? Stick around.</p><p>And people piling on the bandwagon saying oracle's Larry Ellison is making too damn much. It is all the word on Wall Street. We got the scoop coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: They did it. Forget the Delorean (ph), Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown should try the i-car.</p><p>German analyst is now pushing for a partnership between Apple and Tesla saying the tech giant should buy Elon Musk's car company, maybe now is the right time. The electric car maker West Coast Supercharger Corridor is officially open for business. So Model S owners can travel between San Diego, California, and Vancouver, Canada, without worry. But is the buyout a good or bad idea?</p><p>Jean Jennings, editor-in-chief for \"Automobile\" magazine and Dan Ferris is an analyst with Stansberry and Associates.</p><p>Jean, let me start with you, is this a match made in heaven, the i-car courtesy of Tesla?</p><p>JEAN JENNINGS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE: Well, you know, for Elon Musk, it might be because he himself has said their company is has a higher valuation than we rightly deserve. So, for him it might be the perfect time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Dan, what do you think?</p><p>DAN FERRIS, ANALYST, STANSBERRY AND ASSOCIATES: I think Tesla would be a really bad investment for Apple. Set aside arguments whether or not the technologies work together. Tesla is a horrible investment. It is an unprofitable company in one of most capital intensive, ultracompetitive low margin industries in the world. Not a good idea.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Well, let me try to make some of the arguments why it might make sense, Dan. I mean, if you look at Apple, stockholder have fallen out of love with Apple basically since the passing of Steve Jobs. Maybe they need that injection, that magic factor. They need the charismatic person to be back in the company, dreaming up new inventions and making Apple what it was. Couldn't Elon Musk be that kind of creative, driving force, who could bring the imagination and the love back to Apple? No, you're shaking your head already. Ready to shoot me down. Let me have it.</p><p>FERRIS: Well look, here's the problem, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, not the same, OK? Steve Jobs is revolutionized four industries, right, music, phones, movies and computers. And all those are insanely profitable businesses today. And Elon Musk is enamored with these kind of very cutting-edge, I mean, he is a dreamer, right? But very cutting-edge technologies and he is not making money at it.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Jean, Elon is making a whole lot of money for e-bay through PayPal. I mean, PayPal was definitely a $8 home run. Jean, what do you think?</p><p>JENNINGS: Right. So, you know, I think Dan has a lot of great points. But let's talk about what Elon has done in an industry that basically no individual is capable of actually making a car like he has done. He has been incredibly successful. I mean, he has had a hell of a month. He has just done a deal with Panasonic to produce batteries. He has done a deal with AT&amp;T wireless to provide internet connectivity. He has done his corridor but he has done the big trio of big moves. Number one, he got two of the four major car magazines in America to name that car an \"Automobile\" magazine's case, automobile of the year. \"Motor Trend\" car of the year, because it was flat-out the best and most exciting car produced last year.</p><p>In addition to that, \"Consumer Reports\" has just given it a recommended rating, the same rating they took away from Camry and said it was one of the highest, highest place-getting tests they have ever done in their history. Ninety-nine out of 100 points, just performance-wise. In addition to that, the last piece of that NHTSA safety rating. Five stars in every single category. NHTSA said it is highest rated, safest car they have ever --</p><p>FRANCIS: -- of all time it has ever happened.</p><p>Dan -- but the problem, I think Dan is going to say to you, show me the money. I mean, unless you own the stock they are not selling a whole bunch of these cars, they are not making a bunch of these cars. Right, Dan?</p><p>FERRIS: Exactly. Exactly.</p><p>JENNINGS: No argument.</p><p>FERRIS: You know, it is a $90,000 car. Yes. But here is a thing.</p><p>Look. Let's say the three of us owned Apple all together, OK? We're bringing in 45 billion in cash flow a year, free cash flow, biggest non- financial free cash flow stream in the world. And then, I come to you too, and I say hey, let's spend the 25 or 30 billion we need to take over Tesla?</p><p>FRANCIS: But Dan, what is the next i-device? I mean, they need the next big idea. They need the next revenue stream. They need something beyond the phone, the ipad, the computer. Your car, it is the logical extension. That is why German analyst came up with the idea that Apple needs the next thing is i-car, why not? Go ahead. Let me have it.</p><p>FERRIS: No, the i-car, look this technology will be in cars one day, we don't argue that point. But the next thing will probably be, the next category is probably going to be TV, right? That would be the next category.</p><p>FRANCIS: But they have already got Apple TV. I mean, they're already working on that. They're perfecting it. We're going beyond TV. The next thing is the car.</p><p>Jean, go ahead.</p><p>FERRIS: But it is not a real i-TV though.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Jean.</p><p>JENNINGS: Next thing is the future of transportation which is going to be the connected car and it is the autonomous car. There is no doubt about it. And all of --</p><p>FERRIS: Agreed.</p><p>JENNINGS: All of the technology involved that is involved in this is in place now. So it is a matter of knitting it all together. The next technology is -- work on that Elon.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dan, you hate the idea of Apple doing cars or do you hate idea of them partnering with Elon Musk?</p><p>FERRIS: I don't hate the idea of them partnering with Musk. I hate the idea of Apple spending the 25 or 30 billion you would need to do buy a company that burns 330 million a year in cash.</p><p>FRANCIS: Very fair point because at end of the day it is all about money. And you boiled it down to the dollars and I love that we'll end the segment there.</p><p>Thanks to both of you, great job.</p><p>FERRIS: Thank you.</p><p>JENNINGS: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, that was billionaire Larry Ellison is making too much money at expense of Oracle shareholders. Pension fund are piling on saying hell yes. It is all the word on Wall Street.</p><p>Plus, is Target setting a sight on job seekers with checkered pasts. We will tell you why they are rolling out the welcome mat to workers with criminal records.</p><p>Do you have too much \"Money?\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Now, it is time for juiciest part of the day, the whispers, the rumors, what is truer? What is going on behind closed doors? Investors up in arms over Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's pay, shareholders and pensions, are teaming together to wage a campaign opposing the re-election of some of the company's directors at today's annual meeting. And the fury is growing, let me tell you.</p><p>It is about whether Ellison is making too much money at shareholders expense. We got all the dirty details in today's word on Wall Street.</p><p>With me now, Spencer Jakab and Brian Sozzi.</p><p>Guys, thanks for joining me. I mean, this is turning -- Larry Ellison has always attracted a little too much attention to himself with everything that he is doing, whether it enormous yachts, enormous pay day. Is it finally catching up to him? Spencer, what do you think?</p><p>SPENCER JAKAB, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: It definitely is not his behavior that is catching up to him because he has been playing ball for a long time. And that is why when he is making you money, that's fine. The stock is only up a couple of percent this year, not doing so great. And actually, you know, for years, you know, there have been complains about him being highest paid CEO, most years being highest paid CEO. He gets a salary of one dollar like a lot of guys.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. But if you look at total compensation, I mean, and we have a full screen to that to show people. If you look at direct compensation and you compare it to other big CEOs in the same industry, Larry Ellison, you know, out there, there you go. Larry Ellison, 94.6 million. And that is his salary but that is also -- I mean, most of it is his option and his stock and everything else.</p><p>Paul Otellini, John Chambers, Tim Cook, Steve Ballmer, I mean, all a tiny fraction of that. You even go to people like Jamie Dimon, you know, 11.5 million. Nothing is even close to what Larry Ellison --</p><p>Brian, why is he getting that much money again?</p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELLUS CAPITAL ADVISORS: Our time slices is got to shred. First of all, it is hard to argue with it first of all because the stock, market cap is almost over doubled since May 2003. So, in many respects he earned it. But what are you getting for oracle? You are paying for past performance like the shrug who hit the free agent market. And here is one stat to share, on Twitter, Oracle shares since mid 2010 have actually underperformed the Dow, right, sap and Nasdaq. Oracle is a little tech stock.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, absolutely. I mean, when you look at it over the long run it has done well, but if you look at it, you know, year-to-date, last year, three months, one month, anyway you slice it, it is lagging the S&amp;P and in some cases by a lot. You are the day that stand about three in the third percent while the S&amp;P is up 20 percent. So it is just, you know -</p><p>SOZZI: And that is just the performance of the company.</p><p>FRANCIS: And so, Spencer, maybe it is time for him to go?</p><p>JAKAB: It is not so, it is time for him to go. But if you look at what does Larry Ellison bring to Oracle? I mean, he was the force behind it. He was the person pushing it. Today, you know, you can't, he is not analogous to Steve Jobs. He is not indispensable person.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>JAKAB: It happens to be the owner of about a quarter of the stock and one of the richest men in the world. He is worth about $40 billion.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is the inspiration, the driver, I mean, is he the person that the company is really all about? You look, I mean, at what Steve Jobs was, of course, but then you look at other people where the company is really about them. Martha Stewart, I mean, you know, is he the guy who is the driving force behind the company or is the company almost independent of him now?</p><p>Brain, what do you think?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, I sure hope not because the fact is he has made a lot of bad acquisitions, and if I'm shareholder I'm worried about how the guy is spending his money or their money on all his acquisitions over the past year. He is running sailing events. If you look at the Ford structure of Oracle, they only have two independent directors. They have the head of the -- Chairman of the company is former employee. They need more independent directors on Oracle's board.</p><p>And third of all, look at Mark Hurd. He is the guy who made inherit this whole entire company. Is he going to step in the face of Larry Ellison, and say hey you're making too much, probably not.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. And that is really what they are saying. It is they are saying that we need to get -- before we even tackle the issue of Larry Ellison, we have to tackle the issue of the board which is totally beholden to him, and he is doing exactly what he wants. When you see somebody who is making $94 million a year, you know, big U.K. pension fund among those pressing for changes. You have Calpers, the California state retirement system. I mean, they're powerful. They own 11.5 million shares. New York City, for example, 10.3 million shares. Everybody is clamoring for a change in the board to begin with. Do you think the move will be successful?</p><p>JAKAB: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>JAKAB: I don't think it will be successful because you have already votes that have been really damning. You had votes on say on pay and they said thanks but no thanks, you know. We kind of -- we like the way that we are paying him.</p><p>So, it is very, very difficult, especially with the CEO controlling quarter of the stock and so many people --</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, it this live lagging? I mean, maybe this is the problem for the stock. Is it the bad acquisition or is it this idea that you have somebody who is running it, who is just out of control?</p><p>SOZZI: You are right, Melissa. And it is because of all the acquisition. And I point to last year, they put up 12 percent pre-tax operating profit increase. What he need beneath the surface, he actually with many respects high single digit. Why is that happening? Because you require a lot of business like Sun Microsystems in 2008, to high a price, had to write it down, business underperforming. This guy has to go. Time for new blood.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, he bought (INAUDIBLE) of the Hawaiian Islands. I mean, obviously, you know, there is a lot of resort there. It was an investment. But it is very high-profile thing to do. I mean, his bank rolled two victories of America's cup. He missed his developers' conference. That was a huge deal. We were talking about that before because of America's cup. He has a $200 Million Japanese-themed compound in Silicon Valley. Should he tone down his life-style a little bit as he sees the tide turning against him? Would it help or is it too late? What is the scuttlebutt?</p><p>JAKAB: It looks bad, for sure, to buy a Hawaiian Island, to not attend your developers' conference. The keynote that I think 40,000 people had traveled.</p><p>FRANCIS: You don't seem like the $94 million a year man when you are doing that.</p><p>JAKAB: No, you don't. No, it doesn't look good at all. But his behavior is not egregious enough yet to have --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>JAKAB: Exactly because he is just too much wrapped up in associate with the company. I don't think you are going to see that. I think, you know, once he does something that is really embarrassing or he gets becomes, you know, too old to really hang on --</p><p>FRANCIS: Brian, do you agree?</p><p>SOZZI: I am very worried. The fact that he is thinking about buying islands, thinking about sailing yachts, and this is the man in charge of the corporate strategy, of acquisition of the company, same strategy, inspiration, means after buying islands, he is worried about worrying how in committee to mow a lawn at one of these islands. That is not good. You don't want to see that as a shareholder.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, guy. Thank you so much. Great job!</p><p>All right, up next, thinking of filling out a job application at target? You won't have to answer that pesky criminal history question anymore. Should they make it easier for ex-cons to get jobs? Tweet me and tell what you think. It is today's money talker.</p><p>And \"who made \"Money\" today?\" The international icon is sure walking on to a whole lot of cash. You got to keep watching to find out who it is.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>FRANCIS: If you've got a criminal past and you were searching for a job, Target -- hey, it might be just the place to look. That is because now target will not ask if you've been convicted of a crime on their initial job application. Target is not the only one. An unbelievable ten states and 51 cities have signed some version of this practice into law. It's got a lot of people fired up. So, of course, it is today's money talk.</p><p>Joining us now, and not submitting to a background check, by the way, Susan Sullivan, Bill Farmkin and our very own Dennis Kneale.</p><p>Dennis, you're mad about this? You are fired up?</p><p>DENNIS KNEALE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: You know what? This is now the new politically correct, wonderful cause of liberals everywhere. Let's pass a law, an actual law telling companies that they're not allowed to ask applicants at first glance, hey, you have been arrested or convicted of a crime. I say why don't you let companies figure that out instead of dictating to them.</p><p>And our federal EEOC is at the forefront of that. It sued BMW. It sued Dollar General because they use screening programs that kind of faired out convicted or arrested (ph). They said the impact of that is racist. And while the intent is not racist, if the impact of it is racist -- disparate impact, when then, by golly, your policies are illegal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Let him have it.</p><p>SUSAN SOLOVIC, SMALL BUSINESS EXPERT: No one would ever accuse me of being a liberal, trust me. But did you know that one out of four American adults have either an arrest record or a conviction? So, you are just --</p><p>FRANCIS: So what? So what? So what? So, put it on your application. They're not screened out. You're just putting it on your application.</p><p>SOLOVIC: But I think that there probably is a predisposition to see that they're screened out. The problem with that is, what if it's a minor infraction? What if it was a kid who got busted for drugs at an early --</p><p>KNEALE: Well, then let the company go ahead and make an exception. Let it decide to instead of some government --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILL FRUMKIN, EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY: It is absolutely right. The concept is there are laws in many states separate and apart from anti- discrimination laws that say that if you have a criminal background or criminal problem, it has to be related to the job for which you're not eligible for.</p><p>For example, if you were busted for having a joint ten years ago and now you want to be a cashier, what does that have to do with it?</p><p>FRANCIS: Why does it hurt the employer to know? I mean, the employer can say, hey, guess what, that has nothing to do with whether or not you're going to be --</p><p>FRUMKIN: Because that can't be the reason. The reason has to be some other reason.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: It has to be a justifiable reason. The other thing is I used to practice divorce law, I tell you what, divorce makes the sanest person go nuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SOLOVIC: There's a lot of he said/she said when it comes to divorces. If there is a little domestic dispute, that's the only thing on that person's record, I'm sorry, I'm going to give them some slack.</p><p>FRANCIS: The flip side, I mean, I have the right to know if somebody's robbed a bank, I don't want them managing my cash --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, that's what target is talking about this idea that they're not going to check the box.</p><p>FRUMKIN: No, but the point is they won't check the box, but in the interview, OK, it may come out. I mean, they may be able to find out from that screening point. It's not that they can't consider it all, but the truth is, has to be job related.</p><p>And just to talk about discrimination for a moment, the bottom line is that if one in seven African-American males end up in the criminal justice system and one in 30 Caucasian males end up in the criminal justice system, this is a facially-neutral way essentially to keep people out --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't buy that at all. A job is a privilege, it's not a right. Employers are in business to make a profit. They get to choose who they have in their store working for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- there's something about this. Government always so well with intended, it's cruel, because what they're going to do now is the companies are not allowed. In Minnesota, they're not allowed to ask --</p><p>SOLOVIC: That's not true.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: If I can finish -- and then what's going to happen is after they find out that I was convicted and I got my hopes up, they're going to dash my dreams and not hire me.</p><p>SOLOVIC: That is not true. It has got to be fact-sensitive, and you are just taking this and making it too simplistic. All they're doing is saying we're going to at least look into this. If the candidate becomes a serious candidate, they have every right --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- up front then.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: Because they don't know what it is. It says check the box - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- leave it up to companies to be intelligent enough to figure out how they want to handle it. Why should government come in and dictate a list of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Hold on, guys. Why should government come in and dictate to --</p><p>FRUMKIN: Because government requires minimum wage laws, and government requires overtime laws and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- women that we don't discriminate against, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- because a company wants to know if a person has been arrested? Exactly --</p><p>FRANCIS: They've broken the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: It has a disparaging --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRUMKIN: But even if it isn't disparate impact, the bottom line is this, do you want people coming out of jail or coming out and being convicted and never to work again?</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right.</p><p>FRUMKIN: They'll never getting entitlements and then they'll be getting all these other things. What about taxpayers being functioning in society? That's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: Wait a minute. I don't hear you guys worrying about entitlements on any other issue, so you can't now use it on your side when you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: What about the idea don't you guys realize, government is telling us what to do more and more and more. Government is in our face telling us you've got to have not just any insurance, you've got to have this insurance, telling us -- pretty soon they're going to be telling us -- put our left leg pants on in the morning before the right leg. how about just letting business breathe free and --</p><p>SOLOVIC: It I wish that were the --</p><p>FRANCIS: Amen! I am weeping. I am weeping. Go ahead. Respond --</p><p>SOLOVIC: You are being so idealistic. That is never going to happen. We are talking about one little box on an application that --</p><p>KNEALE: If it's one little box, then what are you guys so worried about?</p><p>SOLOVIC: Because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- jobs for the people who have not been arrested and convicted of a crime.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: You have children. What if your child in college gets busted for having marijuana --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: Should my daughter not ever have to pay a price for what she's done wrong?</p><p>FRUMKIN: For the rest of her life and not work?</p><p>FRANCIS: That's it. They're saying for the rest of their life not work. They're saying --</p><p>KNEALE: Let an employer ask.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- so you have to report that going forward. Guys, you were great. Thank you so much. What a spirited discussion. Hoo!</p><p>All right. Coming up, he played one of the most influential engineers ever, and now, a top computer company is hiring Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer. What? We're going to go behind the scenes to see if they might be confusing him with the real Steve Jobs. Stay right where you are. At the end of the day, it is all about MONEY and heat here on this set!</p><p>FRANCIS: So, TV's highest paid actor scores a new gig. Ashton Kutcher is joining forces with Lenovo but not to just simply sell the products as an actual engineer. Kutcher could work with the computer company to offer advice on design and software for its yoga tablets. It is a trend in the endorsement industry using their brains behind the popularity.</p><p>Here now are celebrity journalist, David Caplan, and tech expert, Todd Haselton. Thanks to both of you for joining us.</p><p>David, what do you think? I mean, this is an interesting one, because Ashton, you know, I mean, he's a renowned investor. He's gotten in a lot of things early, Air B&amp;B, you know, a lot of big tech companies. He's not a lightweight in the tech field. At the same time, I have a hard time imaging him actually, you know, designing tablets.</p><p>DAVID CAPLAN, CELEBRITY JOURNALIST: Well, you know, there's two things. First of all, he's an influencer which is a word that's bandied around a lot in the celebrity world meaning he's an influence. You know, Lenovo's great for him. He's perceived as young, he's cutting edge, and I think Ashton Kutcher, he's huge on Twitter. He talks a lot about technology.</p><p>So, first of all, he's already perceived as having that street cred, but then you want to cross that line, well, does he actually have the street cred to do it, and he seems to be a real tech-savvy guy. Listen, he may not be in the actually drafting these things, but when it comes to ideas, I mean, he's on top of the trends. He knows what people want.</p><p>FRANCIS: I guess. But, Todd, I mean, I don't actually know a human being that owns a yoga whatever it is or anything --</p><p>CAPLAN: Now, you will because of Ashton.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD HASELTON, TECHNOBUFFALO EXEC. DIR. OF MOBILE: -- yoga products are sort of the ones that are tablets and computer, and they've --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>HASELTON: No. I don't know --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>CAPLAN: No.</p><p>HASELTON: But to make a point here, I think as Lenovo tries to expand its market share in the United States, it needs a face to do that. And Ashton Kutcher can be that face, but I don't think he's necessarily the right person -- I don't think he's going to be an engineer back there actually coding, although, he suggested that yes, he does have a background in that.</p><p>He has worked closely with start-ups to do so, but I think it's more a play on Lenovos' to get a U.S. presence especially as they move into U.S. smartphones --</p><p>FRANCIS: And they are -- I mean, the point of this, though, the larger point, is that consumers are very savvy now. And just having someone out there, you know, hawking your product doesn't get it done. I mean, when you look at -- who was it that was out there trying to sell -- Alicia Keys -- Alicia Keys out there. She's saying, you know, that she's Blackberry, Blackberry's really cool, Blackberry is not, you know, your grandfather's device from work.</p><p>It's actually cool for young people, and she's doing all this from her iPhone, and she gets busted along the way. And consumers are very savvy to understand that when you put a celebrity out there, they're just doing it for the dollars. So, they're trying to act like they're more integrated into the actual product. Lady Gaga, for example.</p><p>CAPLAN: Polaroid (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>CAPLAN: I mean, but I think, you know, again, for her, that's actually a good match because --</p><p>FRANCIS: What is she actually doing for Polaroid?</p><p>CAPLAN: She's their creative director. So, you know, she is a very creative person. So, for example, she'll maybe design sort of special edition Polaroid cameras. She'll be partaking their advertising --</p><p>FRANCIS: In what sense? I mean, is she there making drawings --</p><p>CAPLAN: I know how this works.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think?</p><p>CAPLAN: I mean, she really is suggesting ideas like, hey, you know, the camera should have this -- you know, be this color, should be pink with this trim.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think they're all rolling their eyes behind her back while she's standing at this meeting saying that people, like yes, whatever --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HASELTON: That's exactly what's going on. And I think that Ashton actually is going to have to prove himself. If he goes to China, which he said he was going there this week, he has to show engineers that he knows what he's talking about. And it's on the company to show not tell (ph), not simply --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. And he says he has his engineering background. Well --</p><p>CAPLAN: He dropped out of school.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. He went to, what was it, University of Iowa. He was in biochemical engineering. That was his major before he dropped out. I mean, biochemical engineering is not the same thing as what he's doing now --</p><p>HASELTON: And he admitted to partying too hard in school.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. And he was doing it because his twin brother has a lot of ailments, so he was looking at medicine. I mean, that's like a far cry from what he's doing now. That that doesn't mean that he has any expertise whatsoever in designing hardware.</p><p>HASELTON: I agree, absolutely.</p><p>CAPLAN: But you know, I will say, you know, I wouldn't necessarily, though, overestimate the public because just as much as some people are star struck (ph) when they see a celebrity endorsement, a celebrity endorsement is huge. While a lot of people are going to be turned off, I mean, every day there's someone new being signed to something. And --</p><p>FRANCIS: Did he sell a lot of cool pix? Wasn't that what he was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAPLAN: Yes. You know, and it worked great for them. There's a whole other category of people out there, specifically, younger people. They like Ashton --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON: -- front and center in the Best Buy, right? So, they're going to walk in to Best Buy and say, oh, an icon. But Lenovo's not so well known name in the United States. Blackberry was on its way out. That's why it didn't work with Alicia Keys. So, you have to look at the business where it's going anyway.</p><p>FRANCIS: But this is the new trend in advertising. I mean, without question -- well, no, it's not. I mean, if you look at something that -- Kim Kardashian tweeting about something different every single day, and people understand she's being paid for that tweet. She probably has no idea what the product is, doesn't use it, doesn't matter.</p><p>That now consumers are demanding something a little bit more authentic, and if you look at other partnerships. I mean, you look at Dr. Dre with the Beatz head phones, working with HP to develop, you know, better sound technology. Here's a celebrity who knows something who does actually know something about the technology --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON: So, he worked in studios, right? So, he knows what to do with headphones. But then, you look at Ashton Kutcher. I haven't seen him working on laptop. I mean --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>HASELTON: You know, he works with start-ups, but not with a laptop. And windows is the problem here. I think people are driving towards that, so what's he going to do to improve windows? That's a Microsoft problem, not a Lenovo one.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. All right. Yes. None of us know a human being (ph), you know, anything Lenovo --</p><p>CAPLAN: By that, we will now, though. It's come a long way, though.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Let's check back in six months and see if we still don't know anyone who owns Lenovo or anything. All right. Thanks, guys. Happy Halloween, by the way.</p><p>All right. From the U.S., every corner of the globe, MONEY has been flying around the world today.</p><p>First to Syria, inspectors there have completed the destruction of machinery used to produce chemical weapons. The organization for the prohibition of chemical weapon which just won the Nobel Peace Prize you might remember is overseeing the process. It says in a statement that it has, quote, \"verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared chemical weapons production equipment. No word, of course, on Syria's undeclared chemical weapons stash.</p><p>On to England where the public is about to get access to a database aimed at busting tax evaders. The new database contains company ownership details. In an effort to expose international money laundering and tax evasion schemes, the information is specific to those with 25 percent or more of a company's shares or voting rights.</p><p>By making it public, the British government is hoping to put pressure on firms and individuals trying to hide money and profits. We'll see if that works.</p><p>All right. Landing in Egypt, the country's tourism board is launching an ambitious campaign to lure back visitors that haven't been scared off by the political turmoil there. Yes, those pictures not helping with tourism. You'd think being home to one of the wonders of the world would be a big enough draw, but Egypt has lost $2.5 billion in revenue since the revolution began in 2011.</p><p>About eleven and a half million tourists visited Egypt in 2012. The tourism board, though, is hoping to increase that to 13.5 million next year. We'll see.</p><p>Some days, you are too sick to work. Other days, you're simply sick off work. And like Ferris Bueller, you just need a day off. From counterfeit colds to fraudulent flus, you won't believe how far some people go to avoid their job. Stick around for \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too much MONEY or too many sick excuses.</p><p>FRANCIS: Time for some fun on \"Spare Change.\" Today, we are joined by Veronica Dagher and David Asman. Thanks for joining us. Happy Halloween. We're all in red even though it's Halloween. All right.</p><p>So, it's that time of year, holidays are approaching. Everyone's just counting how many sick days they have left for the year. What better way to spend this Halloween night than breaking down the most outlandish sick day excuses ever because there's going to be a lot of people calling in sick tomorrow when they stay out late in Halloween. It's a Friday. What's the worst sick excuse you've ever used? David, have you lied and said you were --</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS: You know, I honestly have to say --</p><p>FRANCIS: Come on.</p><p>ASMAN: No, no, no, I actually come in. I'm one of these crazy people who loves to work. I actually came in. I had the worst hangover in my life, so bad --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: And came in anyway?</p><p>ASMAN: It took me about two hours to walk one block because I felt like I was 104. And I came in anyway. But once I get to my desk, my head fell down. We used to work at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I used to work to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I used to work there, and the editor of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" who never came to my office, that one day he came in.</p><p>And luckily, he knew the guy that I'd been drinking with the night before, and I said, I'm sorry, I was out with so and so, and he said, OK, put your head back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Veronica, you have no hope of topping that story.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I really don't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm hoping that you're not the person -- one of the most outlandish excuses that we saw on the Career Builder survey which is, you know, one of the reasons why we're doing this, couldn't make it to work because his false teeth flew out the window while he was driving down the highway.</p><p>ASMAN: That's a good --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think that guy was telling the truth?</p><p>ASMAN: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: Or do you think something else happened, and they made up that crazy excuse? What do you think, Veronica?</p><p>DAGHER: He's crazy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER: Why would you even share that even if it was true?</p><p>FRANCIS: If it's true, why would you share it?</p><p>DAGHER: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you have to be lying. That's my thought with something like that, right?</p><p>DAGHER: Yes. I mean, I could see that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thirty-three percent of people who called out sick, according to Career Builder, just didn't feel like going to work.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: They called and said they were sick.</p><p>ASMAN: Actually, seriously, I did once when I was at \"The Journal,\" I had to fire somebody because she was always using excuses. But I don't think they were -- this was before the days of all the surveillance devices and everything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- posting on Facebook. I mean, they call in sick and then they tweet or they post on Facebook --</p><p>ASMAN: Well, that's it. You can prove it now. In my day, you couldn't necessarily prove it quite as easily. But now, you can prove it. Certainly, if they post anything on Facebook. And I do know of one person who was caught at a baseball game, and they were seen --</p><p>FRANCIS: According to a survey, 30 percent of employers check on employees, either ask them for a doctor's note or they look on social media to see if they really sick when they say -- so word to the wise out there. The first Monday in February is the most popular day for employees to call out sick.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: See, I think that makes total sense because you go through the holidays and you have a great time. You come back in January, and you hit -- you're like, ah, we don't have a day off or anything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, either that or it's the Super Bowl.</p><p>ASMAN: Oh, bingo. That's it. Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. People call in -- but I always think -- I mean, I'm always amazed, I do notice people calling in the day after the Super Bowl, and I'm shocked --</p><p>ASMAN: By the way, you mentioned the false teeth. My favorite one is the guy who called in sick because he said a swarm of bees had surrounded his car, and he couldn't get out. Oh, my goodness!</p><p>FRANCIS: There it is.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, he had proof, i didn't know that.</p><p>FRANCIS: He had proof of it, but obviously, he called someone on a phone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Anyway, all right. Thanks, guys. \"Who Made Money Today?\" It sure is a beautiful day for him and his investors. Not sure who it is? We'll have the answer right after this. You can never have too much MONEY or too many sick excuses.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made Money today.\" Once again, everyone who owns Facebook. Company reported strong third quarter earnings. Social media giant says it swung to a profit with 60 percent revenue growth, beating the street's expectations. Investors decided they aren't overly concerned about a big decline in daily use by younger teens. And Facebook stock closed up almost 2.5 percent today.</p><p>Rock star, Bono, and his investment group, Elevation Partners, owns about 40 million shares of Facebook. They made a very impressive 48 million bucks today. I would take that. Not bad.</p><p>Also making money today, a 67 year-old man in Orlando, Florida who just won his second multimillion-dollar lotto in two years. The Florida Lottery says James Boseman Jr. (ph) hit the jackpot for a three million bucks. Last year, he won 10 million bucks. He bought both tickets from the same 7/11. Fun fact. He didn't use the same numbers. In case you're wondering, the odds of a double win like that are about one in 196 trillion.</p><p>And not spending money, on the Fresno State Basketball team's opening game, everyone who's going. That's because Indiana Pacers all-star, Paul George, bought every single ticket to his Alma Matters first game. The \"Fresno Business Journal\" reports all George purchased all 15,596 seats at the Save Mart Center.</p><p>And season-ticket holders won't have to worry. They'll have the same seats for the game. It's the NBA star's way of giving back to his former college. And the low estimate for what it costs him, about $265,000. Though given that, he just signed a contract extension worth $90 million over five years, I guess, he can afford it.</p><p>That's all we've got for you. I hope you made MONEY today. You've got to watch tomorrow. Our money talker is all about how you should really dress for work. What about those short skirts and too tight dresses? How about the CEO who says women who wear high heels have no brains? Those are fighting words, and we are all over it. That is tomorrow. \"The Willis Report\" is coming up next. Happy Halloween.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2013103101cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59R1-TDK1-JB20-G0TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>October 31, 2013 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Housing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621399QC</classCode><className>PHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001657</classCode><className>SURGERY &amp; TRANSPLANTATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N4494112M</classCode><className>INTERNET AUCTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N611310MM</classCode><className>MEDICAL EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621399QC</classCode><className>PHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001064</classCode><className>MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGMzQ2NUZDREVCNEEwQkI0N0I4NjQ2RDVBQTFEQzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc</classCode><className>Managed Healthcare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N4494112M</classCode><className>INTERNET AUCTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It's happening more and more, because when they say it's not, it's always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sure, we all love going online to find the best deal, but usually we're talking about a hotel room, a flight, a television. Would you feel comfortable accepting online bid for hip replacement from a doctor you never met? It is newest wave in comparison shopping and the Web site METABID (ph) giving people chance to evaluate offers from doctors across the country and then travel to get the care of their choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to discuss how it all works, the president, Ralph Weber.</p><p>Ralph, what is the experience, I go online what happens?</p><p>RALPH WEBER, PRESIDENT, METABID: Well, you go online and make a request. Now, it depend if you work for employer that uses met at that bid as source care or just an individual. So, you make a request and you can put in your parameters, a few health questions, you know, your height, your weight, any medication allergies. You can put in how far you're willing to travel, if at all. And then you request a bid. You can review all the doctors' profiles. So you see where they went to medical school, what their training was, what their experience is. How many of these procedures they do every year. So you really get to see a lot about the quality of the doctor, as you make the request.</p><p>FRANCIS: wow.</p><p>WEBER: --which with traditional insurance, all you know is in network or out of network.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. You really don't know that much. I mean, although you are able to ask people in your community, generally, especially if your community is smaller that everybody sort of knows everybody. I have a lot of questions about all that.</p><p>OK. So, if I'm an individual do I have to join and pay a fee in order to go look at my employer is not a member?</p><p>WEBER: Yes, if your employer is not a member, you can pay $25 just for one request or join $4.95 per month. And then $4.95 per month is a one-year commitment and then you can go on anytime you like to make a request.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you know, the biggest question, I'm sure, that everyone in the audience has what kind of doctors do you have on the network? I mean, does it include everyone? Is it just a small group? I mean, what percentage would you say of the doctors in America are available in your Web site?</p><p>WEBER: Well, not a huge percentage. We look for doctors that are not the mainstream big box type of providers. Doctors prefer getting cash at the time of care. The traditional insurance model where they will, you know, charge one price that is called the charge master. And then they carry a re-prices it to the allowable, and then they're paid a portion of that. It sometimes takes 120 days or so for them to get their money. So, the doctors like getting paid at the time of the care. And also they get to set their own prices.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: With traditional insurance they're told what they would be paid that is it.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that is interesting. They get to set their own prices to see what the market will bear. A lot of our viewers tweeted in and said, you know, it is very normal for people to travel to Sloane Kettering or to travel to MD Anderson for cancer treatment. So, they're familiar with the idea of traveling to big. Do you have big names like that on your site?</p><p>WEBER: Yes. As a matter of fact, we do Baylor in Houston, MD Anderson is participating on very small level. We have talked to Kerlin Jobe in Los Angeles. They kind of were looking at it. They haven't made a final evaluation. So absolutely, and we have overseas facility like in (INAUDIBLE) and Bangkok.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let me ask you about how some financials work, OK. So, say I get to -- the doctor looks great online, you know, I look at it -- for whatever you can tell. I mean, have the same problem when I'm on my own health network and you are looking, you see their education. But until you go see them, you don't really know them. So, say you get out there and you meet them or you see hospital and don't feel good about it. What happens then? Do you lose the travel money? How do the financials work?</p><p>WEBER: OK, well, I mean, if you paid for your own flight, then, yes, I mean you've had sort of two-day vacation I guess or whatever. I mean, it is not much different than if you looked in the yellow pages and went to MD Anderson or the local, you know, corner hospital either way. I mean, if you get there, you don't like the physician for whatever reason.</p><p>Now keep in mind you've had a lot of transactions before you get to there. A lot of doctors when they respond to a bid they will say, OK, you know, before we go through this, maybe we should have a phone call or talk on Skype or something like that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: So usually by the time you get there you've actually kind of met the person, sort of online.</p><p>FRANCIS: And how does insurance play into this? Because there a couple of articles that I was reading about this, they were saying that in some cases your insurance company will pay for to you fly to another place if it is significantly cheaper for then. How do you get your insurance company involved in shopping for prices?</p><p>WEBER: Well, a lot of people use private third party administrators where they have more flexibility and it has to be right in the plan document where it will allow. Some of the big carriers won't actually allow you to negotiate a better price without considering it out of network which means you pay more of a deductible. So, you have to make sure your plan is set up to wraparound this kind of travel arrangement.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>WEBER: I mean, if you're getting a knee replacement for 21,000 versus 70, it would be foolish for the carrier not to cover. So, it was self- funded employers where they can do this.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is the most common type of surgery people are traveling for? What do you see the most? Because I imagine it isn't emergency surgery where people are price comparing.</p><p>WEBER: No. That is true. Our app is not quite fast enough to work in the ambulance.</p><p>A lot of people are using knee replacement, hip replacement, colonoscopies. Those are some of our more common. Rotator cuff repair, we are getting a lot of requests for cosmetic procedures. But I think orthopedic would be the most common surgery because they're mostly preplanned.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>No, it's a very interesting model because of course we're going through these dramatic changes in health care. People are trying to figure out, you know, as they're forced to bear more of a burden of the cost, how they can make it cheaper for themselves. Here in New York a lot of doctors stopped taking insurance all together and gone to all cash because the system is so hard to deal with.</p><p>WEBER: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, an application like yours I can see it gaining a lot of popularity as people, you know, realize they're really out there on their own trying to fend for themselves.</p><p>Ralph Weber, great stuff, thank you so much. Very interesting.</p><p>WEBER: And it is not just about price though, Melissa. It is not just about price. I mean, when you go to hotels.com, you don't look for a motel 6. It is sometimes about access. Sometimes crossing a state line, different medical board has different medical regulations with drastically can increase or decrease the cost. So, it is about accessing and choice and getting the doctor that you want rather than the one that covers you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, that is a great point. I'm glad you added that.</p><p>Ralph, I think it is the wave of the future. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>WEBER: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, it won't be long before we're all driving i-cars. Who can help Apple win the race? Stick around.</p><p>And people piling on the bandwagon saying oracle's Larry Ellison is making too damn much. It is all the word on Wall Street. We got the scoop coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: They did it. Forget the Delorean (ph), Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown should try the i-car.</p><p>German analyst is now pushing for a partnership between Apple and Tesla saying the tech giant should buy Elon Musk's car company, maybe now is the right time. The electric car maker West Coast Supercharger Corridor is officially open for business. So Model S owners can travel between San Diego, California, and Vancouver, Canada, without worry. But is the buyout a good or bad idea?</p><p>Jean Jennings, editor-in-chief for \"Automobile\" magazine and Dan Ferris is an analyst with Stansberry and Associates.</p><p>Jean, let me start with you, is this a match made in heaven, the i-car courtesy of Tesla?</p><p>JEAN JENNINGS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE: Well, you know, for Elon Musk, it might be because he himself has said their company is has a higher valuation than we rightly deserve. So, for him it might be the perfect time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. Dan, what do you think?</p><p>DAN FERRIS, ANALYST, STANSBERRY AND ASSOCIATES: I think Tesla would be a really bad investment for Apple. Set aside arguments whether or not the technologies work together. Tesla is a horrible investment. It is an unprofitable company in one of most capital intensive, ultracompetitive low margin industries in the world. Not a good idea.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Well, let me try to make some of the arguments why it might make sense, Dan. I mean, if you look at Apple, stockholder have fallen out of love with Apple basically since the passing of Steve Jobs. Maybe they need that injection, that magic factor. They need the charismatic person to be back in the company, dreaming up new inventions and making Apple what it was. Couldn't Elon Musk be that kind of creative, driving force, who could bring the imagination and the love back to Apple? No, you're shaking your head already. Ready to shoot me down. Let me have it.</p><p>FERRIS: Well look, here's the problem, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, not the same, OK? Steve Jobs is revolutionized four industries, right, music, phones, movies and computers. And all those are insanely profitable businesses today. And Elon Musk is enamored with these kind of very cutting-edge, I mean, he is a dreamer, right? But very cutting-edge technologies and he is not making money at it.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Jean, Elon is making a whole lot of money for e-bay through PayPal. I mean, PayPal was definitely a $8 home run. Jean, what do you think?</p><p>JENNINGS: Right. So, you know, I think Dan has a lot of great points. But let's talk about what Elon has done in an industry that basically no individual is capable of actually making a car like he has done. He has been incredibly successful. I mean, he has had a hell of a month. He has just done a deal with Panasonic to produce batteries. He has done a deal with AT&amp;T wireless to provide internet connectivity. He has done his corridor but he has done the big trio of big moves. Number one, he got two of the four major car magazines in America to name that car an \"Automobile\" magazine's case, automobile of the year. \"Motor Trend\" car of the year, because it was flat-out the best and most exciting car produced last year.</p><p>In addition to that, \"Consumer Reports\" has just given it a recommended rating, the same rating they took away from Camry and said it was one of the highest, highest place-getting tests they have ever done in their history. Ninety-nine out of 100 points, just performance-wise. In addition to that, the last piece of that NHTSA safety rating. Five stars in every single category. NHTSA said it is highest rated, safest car they have ever --</p><p>FRANCIS: -- of all time it has ever happened.</p><p>Dan -- but the problem, I think Dan is going to say to you, show me the money. I mean, unless you own the stock they are not selling a whole bunch of these cars, they are not making a bunch of these cars. Right, Dan?</p><p>FERRIS: Exactly. Exactly.</p><p>JENNINGS: No argument.</p><p>FERRIS: You know, it is a $90,000 car. Yes. But here is a thing.</p><p>Look. Let's say the three of us owned Apple all together, OK? We're bringing in 45 billion in cash flow a year, free cash flow, biggest non- financial free cash flow stream in the world. And then, I come to you too, and I say hey, let's spend the 25 or 30 billion we need to take over Tesla?</p><p>FRANCIS: But Dan, what is the next i-device? I mean, they need the next big idea. They need the next revenue stream. They need something beyond the phone, the ipad, the computer. Your car, it is the logical extension. That is why German analyst came up with the idea that Apple needs the next thing is i-car, why not? Go ahead. Let me have it.</p><p>FERRIS: No, the i-car, look this technology will be in cars one day, we don't argue that point. But the next thing will probably be, the next category is probably going to be TV, right? That would be the next category.</p><p>FRANCIS: But they have already got Apple TV. I mean, they're already working on that. They're perfecting it. We're going beyond TV. The next thing is the car.</p><p>Jean, go ahead.</p><p>FERRIS: But it is not a real i-TV though.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Jean.</p><p>JENNINGS: Next thing is the future of transportation which is going to be the connected car and it is the autonomous car. There is no doubt about it. And all of --</p><p>FERRIS: Agreed.</p><p>JENNINGS: All of the technology involved that is involved in this is in place now. So it is a matter of knitting it all together. The next technology is -- work on that Elon.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dan, you hate the idea of Apple doing cars or do you hate idea of them partnering with Elon Musk?</p><p>FERRIS: I don't hate the idea of them partnering with Musk. I hate the idea of Apple spending the 25 or 30 billion you would need to do buy a company that burns 330 million a year in cash.</p><p>FRANCIS: Very fair point because at end of the day it is all about money. And you boiled it down to the dollars and I love that we'll end the segment there.</p><p>Thanks to both of you, great job.</p><p>FERRIS: Thank you.</p><p>JENNINGS: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, that was billionaire Larry Ellison is making too much money at expense of Oracle shareholders. Pension fund are piling on saying hell yes. It is all the word on Wall Street.</p><p>Plus, is Target setting a sight on job seekers with checkered pasts. We will tell you why they are rolling out the welcome mat to workers with criminal records.</p><p>Do you have too much \"Money?\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Now, it is time for juiciest part of the day, the whispers, the rumors, what is truer? What is going on behind closed doors? Investors up in arms over Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's pay, shareholders and pensions, are teaming together to wage a campaign opposing the re-election of some of the company's directors at today's annual meeting. And the fury is growing, let me tell you.</p><p>It is about whether Ellison is making too much money at shareholders expense. We got all the dirty details in today's word on Wall Street.</p><p>With me now, Spencer Jakab and Brian Sozzi.</p><p>Guys, thanks for joining me. I mean, this is turning -- Larry Ellison has always attracted a little too much attention to himself with everything that he is doing, whether it enormous yachts, enormous pay day. Is it finally catching up to him? Spencer, what do you think?</p><p>SPENCER JAKAB, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: It definitely is not his behavior that is catching up to him because he has been playing ball for a long time. And that is why when he is making you money, that's fine. The stock is only up a couple of percent this year, not doing so great. And actually, you know, for years, you know, there have been complains about him being highest paid CEO, most years being highest paid CEO. He gets a salary of one dollar like a lot of guys.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. But if you look at total compensation, I mean, and we have a full screen to that to show people. If you look at direct compensation and you compare it to other big CEOs in the same industry, Larry Ellison, you know, out there, there you go. Larry Ellison, 94.6 million. And that is his salary but that is also -- I mean, most of it is his option and his stock and everything else.</p><p>Paul Otellini, John Chambers, Tim Cook, Steve Ballmer, I mean, all a tiny fraction of that. You even go to people like Jamie Dimon, you know, 11.5 million. Nothing is even close to what Larry Ellison --</p><p>Brian, why is he getting that much money again?</p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELLUS CAPITAL ADVISORS: Our time slices is got to shred. First of all, it is hard to argue with it first of all because the stock, market cap is almost over doubled since May 2003. So, in many respects he earned it. But what are you getting for oracle? You are paying for past performance like the shrug who hit the free agent market. And here is one stat to share, on Twitter, Oracle shares since mid 2010 have actually underperformed the Dow, right, sap and Nasdaq. Oracle is a little tech stock.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. No, absolutely. I mean, when you look at it over the long run it has done well, but if you look at it, you know, year-to-date, last year, three months, one month, anyway you slice it, it is lagging the S&amp;P and in some cases by a lot. You are the day that stand about three in the third percent while the S&amp;P is up 20 percent. So it is just, you know -</p><p>SOZZI: And that is just the performance of the company.</p><p>FRANCIS: And so, Spencer, maybe it is time for him to go?</p><p>JAKAB: It is not so, it is time for him to go. But if you look at what does Larry Ellison bring to Oracle? I mean, he was the force behind it. He was the person pushing it. Today, you know, you can't, he is not analogous to Steve Jobs. He is not indispensable person.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>JAKAB: It happens to be the owner of about a quarter of the stock and one of the richest men in the world. He is worth about $40 billion.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is the inspiration, the driver, I mean, is he the person that the company is really all about? You look, I mean, at what Steve Jobs was, of course, but then you look at other people where the company is really about them. Martha Stewart, I mean, you know, is he the guy who is the driving force behind the company or is the company almost independent of him now?</p><p>Brain, what do you think?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, I sure hope not because the fact is he has made a lot of bad acquisitions, and if I'm shareholder I'm worried about how the guy is spending his money or their money on all his acquisitions over the past year. He is running sailing events. If you look at the Ford structure of Oracle, they only have two independent directors. They have the head of the -- Chairman of the company is former employee. They need more independent directors on Oracle's board.</p><p>And third of all, look at Mark Hurd. He is the guy who made inherit this whole entire company. Is he going to step in the face of Larry Ellison, and say hey you're making too much, probably not.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. And that is really what they are saying. It is they are saying that we need to get -- before we even tackle the issue of Larry Ellison, we have to tackle the issue of the board which is totally beholden to him, and he is doing exactly what he wants. When you see somebody who is making $94 million a year, you know, big U.K. pension fund among those pressing for changes. You have Calpers, the California state retirement system. I mean, they're powerful. They own 11.5 million shares. New York City, for example, 10.3 million shares. Everybody is clamoring for a change in the board to begin with. Do you think the move will be successful?</p><p>JAKAB: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>JAKAB: I don't think it will be successful because you have already votes that have been really damning. You had votes on say on pay and they said thanks but no thanks, you know. We kind of -- we like the way that we are paying him.</p><p>So, it is very, very difficult, especially with the CEO controlling quarter of the stock and so many people --</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, it this live lagging? I mean, maybe this is the problem for the stock. Is it the bad acquisition or is it this idea that you have somebody who is running it, who is just out of control?</p><p>SOZZI: You are right, Melissa. And it is because of all the acquisition. And I point to last year, they put up 12 percent pre-tax operating profit increase. What he need beneath the surface, he actually with many respects high single digit. Why is that happening? Because you require a lot of business like Sun Microsystems in 2008, to high a price, had to write it down, business underperforming. This guy has to go. Time for new blood.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, he bought (INAUDIBLE) of the Hawaiian Islands. I mean, obviously, you know, there is a lot of resort there. It was an investment. But it is very high-profile thing to do. I mean, his bank rolled two victories of America's cup. He missed his developers' conference. That was a huge deal. We were talking about that before because of America's cup. He has a $200 Million Japanese-themed compound in Silicon Valley. Should he tone down his life-style a little bit as he sees the tide turning against him? Would it help or is it too late? What is the scuttlebutt?</p><p>JAKAB: It looks bad, for sure, to buy a Hawaiian Island, to not attend your developers' conference. The keynote that I think 40,000 people had traveled.</p><p>FRANCIS: You don't seem like the $94 million a year man when you are doing that.</p><p>JAKAB: No, you don't. No, it doesn't look good at all. But his behavior is not egregious enough yet to have --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>JAKAB: Exactly because he is just too much wrapped up in associate with the company. I don't think you are going to see that. I think, you know, once he does something that is really embarrassing or he gets becomes, you know, too old to really hang on --</p><p>FRANCIS: Brian, do you agree?</p><p>SOZZI: I am very worried. The fact that he is thinking about buying islands, thinking about sailing yachts, and this is the man in charge of the corporate strategy, of acquisition of the company, same strategy, inspiration, means after buying islands, he is worried about worrying how in committee to mow a lawn at one of these islands. That is not good. You don't want to see that as a shareholder.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, guy. Thank you so much. Great job!</p><p>All right, up next, thinking of filling out a job application at target? You won't have to answer that pesky criminal history question anymore. Should they make it easier for ex-cons to get jobs? Tweet me and tell what you think. It is today's money talker.</p><p>And \"who made \"Money\" today?\" The international icon is sure walking on to a whole lot of cash. You got to keep watching to find out who it is.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: If you've got a criminal past and you were searching for a job, Target -- hey, it might be just the place to look. That is because now target will not ask if you've been convicted of a crime on their initial job application. Target is not the only one. An unbelievable ten states and 51 cities have signed some version of this practice into law. It's got a lot of people fired up. So, of course, it is today's money talk.</p><p>Joining us now, and not submitting to a background check, by the way, Susan Sullivan, Bill Farmkin and our very own Dennis Kneale.</p><p>Dennis, you're mad about this? You are fired up?</p><p>DENNIS KNEALE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: You know what? This is now the new politically correct, wonderful cause of liberals everywhere. Let's pass a law, an actual law telling companies that they're not allowed to ask applicants at first glance, hey, you have been arrested or convicted of a crime. I say why don't you let companies figure that out instead of dictating to them.</p><p>And our federal EEOC is at the forefront of that. It sued BMW. It sued Dollar General because they use screening programs that kind of faired out convicted or arrested (ph). They said the impact of that is racist. And while the intent is not racist, if the impact of it is racist -- disparate impact, when then, by golly, your policies are illegal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Let him have it.</p><p>SUSAN SOLOVIC, SMALL BUSINESS EXPERT: No one would ever accuse me of being a liberal, trust me. But did you know that one out of four American adults have either an arrest record or a conviction? So, you are just --</p><p>FRANCIS: So what? So what? So what? So, put it on your application. They're not screened out. You're just putting it on your application.</p><p>SOLOVIC: But I think that there probably is a predisposition to see that they're screened out. The problem with that is, what if it's a minor infraction? What if it was a kid who got busted for drugs at an early --</p><p>KNEALE: Well, then let the company go ahead and make an exception. Let it decide to instead of some government --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILL FRUMKIN, EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY: It is absolutely right. The concept is there are laws in many states separate and apart from anti- discrimination laws that say that if you have a criminal background or criminal problem, it has to be related to the job for which you're not eligible for.</p><p>For example, if you were busted for having a joint ten years ago and now you want to be a cashier, what does that have to do with it?</p><p>FRANCIS: Why does it hurt the employer to know? I mean, the employer can say, hey, guess what, that has nothing to do with whether or not you're going to be --</p><p>FRUMKIN: Because that can't be the reason. The reason has to be some other reason.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: It has to be a justifiable reason. The other thing is I used to practice divorce law, I tell you what, divorce makes the sanest person go nuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SOLOVIC: There's a lot of he said/she said when it comes to divorces. If there is a little domestic dispute, that's the only thing on that person's record, I'm sorry, I'm going to give them some slack.</p><p>FRANCIS: The flip side, I mean, I have the right to know if somebody's robbed a bank, I don't want them managing my cash --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, that's what target is talking about this idea that they're not going to check the box.</p><p>FRUMKIN: No, but the point is they won't check the box, but in the interview, OK, it may come out. I mean, they may be able to find out from that screening point. It's not that they can't consider it all, but the truth is, has to be job related.</p><p>And just to talk about discrimination for a moment, the bottom line is that if one in seven African-American males end up in the criminal justice system and one in 30 Caucasian males end up in the criminal justice system, this is a facially-neutral way essentially to keep people out --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't buy that at all. A job is a privilege, it's not a right. Employers are in business to make a profit. They get to choose who they have in their store working for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- there's something about this. Government always so well with intended, it's cruel, because what they're going to do now is the companies are not allowed. In Minnesota, they're not allowed to ask --</p><p>SOLOVIC: That's not true.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: If I can finish -- and then what's going to happen is after they find out that I was convicted and I got my hopes up, they're going to dash my dreams and not hire me.</p><p>SOLOVIC: That is not true. It has got to be fact-sensitive, and you are just taking this and making it too simplistic. All they're doing is saying we're going to at least look into this. If the candidate becomes a serious candidate, they have every right --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- up front then.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: Because they don't know what it is. It says check the box - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- leave it up to companies to be intelligent enough to figure out how they want to handle it. Why should government come in and dictate a list of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Hold on, guys. Why should government come in and dictate to --</p><p>FRUMKIN: Because government requires minimum wage laws, and government requires overtime laws and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- women that we don't discriminate against, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- because a company wants to know if a person has been arrested? Exactly --</p><p>FRANCIS: They've broken the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: It has a disparaging --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRUMKIN: But even if it isn't disparate impact, the bottom line is this, do you want people coming out of jail or coming out and being convicted and never to work again?</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right.</p><p>FRUMKIN: They'll never getting entitlements and then they'll be getting all these other things. What about taxpayers being functioning in society? That's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: Wait a minute. I don't hear you guys worrying about entitlements on any other issue, so you can't now use it on your side when you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: What about the idea don't you guys realize, government is telling us what to do more and more and more. Government is in our face telling us you've got to have not just any insurance, you've got to have this insurance, telling us -- pretty soon they're going to be telling us -- put our left leg pants on in the morning before the right leg. how about just letting business breathe free and --</p><p>SOLOVIC: It I wish that were the --</p><p>FRANCIS: Amen! I am weeping. I am weeping. Go ahead. Respond --</p><p>SOLOVIC: You are being so idealistic. That is never going to happen. We are talking about one little box on an application that --</p><p>KNEALE: If it's one little box, then what are you guys so worried about?</p><p>SOLOVIC: Because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: -- jobs for the people who have not been arrested and convicted of a crime.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC: You have children. What if your child in college gets busted for having marijuana --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE: Should my daughter not ever have to pay a price for what she's done wrong?</p><p>FRUMKIN: For the rest of her life and not work?</p><p>FRANCIS: That's it. They're saying for the rest of their life not work. They're saying --</p><p>KNEALE: Let an employer ask.</p><p>FRANCIS: -- so you have to report that going forward. Guys, you were great. Thank you so much. What a spirited discussion. Hoo!</p><p>All right. Coming up, he played one of the most influential engineers ever, and now, a top computer company is hiring Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer. What?

At the end of the day, it is all about MONEY and heat here on this set!</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: So, TV's highest paid actor scores a new gig. Ashton Kutcher is joining forces with Lenovo but not to just simply sell the products as an actual engineer. Kutcher could work with the computer company to offer advice on design and software for its yoga tablets. It is a trend in the endorsement industry using their brains behind the popularity.</p><p>Here now are celebrity journalist, David Caplan, and tech expert, Todd Haselton. Thanks to both of you for joining us.</p><p>David, what do you think? I mean, this is an interesting one, because Ashton, you know, I mean, he's a renowned investor. He's gotten in a lot of things early, Air B&amp;B, you know, a lot of big tech companies. He's not a lightweight in the tech field. At the same time, I have a hard time imaging him actually, you know, designing tablets.</p><p>DAVID CAPLAN, CELEBRITY JOURNALIST: Well, you know, there's two things. First of all, he's an influencer which is a word that's bandied around a lot in the celebrity world meaning he's an influence. You know, Lenovo's great for him. He's perceived as young, he's cutting edge, and I think Ashton Kutcher, he's huge on Twitter. He talks a lot about technology.</p><p>So, first of all, he's already perceived as having that street cred, but then you want to cross that line, well, does he actually have the street cred to do it, and he seems to be a real tech-savvy guy. Listen, he may not be in the actually drafting these things, but when it comes to ideas, I mean, he's on top of the trends. He knows what people want.</p><p>FRANCIS: I guess. But, Todd, I mean, I don't actually know a human being that owns a yoga whatever it is or anything --</p><p>CAPLAN: Now, you will because of Ashton.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD HASELTON, TECHNOBUFFALO EXEC. DIR. OF MOBILE: -- yoga products are sort of the ones that are tablets and computer, and they've --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>HASELTON: No. I don't know --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>CAPLAN: No.</p><p>HASELTON: But to make a point here, I think as Lenovo tries to expand its market share in the United States, it needs a face to do that. And Ashton Kutcher can be that face, but I don't think he's necessarily the right person -- I don't think he's going to be an engineer back there actually coding, although, he suggested that yes, he does have a background in that.</p><p>He has worked closely with start-ups to do so, but I think it's more a play on Lenovos' to get a U.S. presence especially as they move into U.S. smartphones --</p><p>FRANCIS: And they are -- I mean, the point of this, though, the larger point, is that consumers are very savvy now. And just having someone out there, you know, hawking your product doesn't get it done. I mean, when you look at -- who was it that was out there trying to sell -- Alicia Keys -- Alicia Keys out there. She's saying, you know, that she's Blackberry, Blackberry's really cool, Blackberry is not, you know, your grandfather's device from work.</p><p>It's actually cool for young people, and she's doing all this from her iPhone, and she gets busted along the way. And consumers are very savvy to understand that when you put a celebrity out there, they're just doing it for the dollars. So, they're trying to act like they're more integrated into the actual product. Lady Gaga, for example.</p><p>CAPLAN: Polaroid (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>CAPLAN: I mean, but I think, you know, again, for her, that's actually a good match because --</p><p>FRANCIS: What is she actually doing for Polaroid?</p><p>CAPLAN: She's their creative director. So, you know, she is a very creative person. So, for example, she'll maybe design sort of special edition Polaroid cameras. She'll be partaking their advertising --</p><p>FRANCIS: In what sense? I mean, is she there making drawings --</p><p>CAPLAN: I know how this works.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think?</p><p>CAPLAN: I mean, she really is suggesting ideas like, hey, you know, the camera should have this -- you know, be this color, should be pink with this trim.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think they're all rolling their eyes behind her back while she's standing at this meeting saying that people, like yes, whatever --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HASELTON: That's exactly what's going on. And I think that Ashton actually is going to have to prove himself. If he goes to China, which he said he was going there this week, he has to show engineers that he knows what he's talking about. And it's on the company to show not tell (ph), not simply --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. And he says he has his engineering background. Well --</p><p>CAPLAN: He dropped out of school.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. He went to, what was it, University of Iowa. He was in biochemical engineering. That was his major before he dropped out. I mean, biochemical engineering is not the same thing as what he's doing now --</p><p>HASELTON: And he admitted to partying too hard in school.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. And he was doing it because his twin brother has a lot of ailments, so he was looking at medicine. I mean, that's like a far cry from what he's doing now. That that doesn't mean that he has any expertise whatsoever in designing hardware.</p><p>HASELTON: I agree, absolutely.</p><p>CAPLAN: But you know, I will say, you know, I wouldn't necessarily, though, overestimate the public because just as much as some people are star struck (ph) when they see a celebrity endorsement, a celebrity endorsement is huge. While a lot of people are going to be turned off, I mean, every day there's someone new being signed to something. And --</p><p>FRANCIS: Did he sell a lot of cool pix? Wasn't that what he was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAPLAN: Yes. You know, and it worked great for them. There's a whole other category of people out there, specifically, younger people. They like Ashton --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON: -- front and center in the Best Buy, right? So, they're going to walk in to Best Buy and say, oh, an icon. But Lenovo's not so well known name in the United States. Blackberry was on its way out. That's why it didn't work with Alicia Keys. So, you have to look at the business where it's going anyway.</p><p>FRANCIS: But this is the new trend in advertising. I mean, without question -- well, no, it's not. I mean, if you look at something that -- Kim Kardashian tweeting about something different every single day, and people understand she's being paid for that tweet. She probably has no idea what the product is, doesn't use it, doesn't matter.</p><p>That now consumers are demanding something a little bit more authentic, and if you look at other partnerships. I mean, you look at Dr. Dre with the Beatz head phones, working with HP to develop, you know, better sound technology. Here's a celebrity who knows something who does actually know something about the technology --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON: So, he worked in studios, right? So, he knows what to do with headphones. But then, you look at Ashton Kutcher. I haven't seen him working on laptop. I mean --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>HASELTON: You know, he works with start-ups, but not with a laptop. And windows is the problem here. I think people are driving towards that, so what's he going to do to improve windows? That's a Microsoft problem, not a Lenovo one.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. All right. Yes. None of us know a human being (ph), you know, anything Lenovo --</p><p>CAPLAN: By that, we will now, though. It's come a long way, though.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Let's check back in six months and see if we still don't know anyone who owns Lenovo or anything. All right. Thanks, guys. Happy Halloween, by the way.</p><p>All right. From the U.S., every corner of the globe, MONEY has been flying around the world today.</p><p>First to Syria, inspectors there have completed the destruction of machinery used to produce chemical weapons. The organization for the prohibition of chemical weapon which just won the Nobel Peace Prize you might remember is overseeing the process. It says in a statement that it has, quote, \"verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared chemical weapons production equipment. No word, of course, on Syria's undeclared chemical weapons stash.</p><p>On to England where the public is about to get access to a database aimed at busting tax evaders. The new database contains company ownership details. In an effort to expose international money laundering and tax evasion schemes, the information is specific to those with 25 percent or more of a company's shares or voting rights.</p><p>By making it public, the British government is hoping to put pressure on firms and individuals trying to hide money and profits. We'll see if that works.</p><p>All right. Landing in Egypt, the country's tourism board is launching an ambitious campaign to lure back visitors that haven't been scared off by the political turmoil there. Yes, those pictures not helping with tourism. You'd think being home to one of the wonders of the world would be a big enough draw, but Egypt has lost $2.5 billion in revenue since the revolution began in 2011.</p><p>About eleven and a half million tourists visited Egypt in 2012. The tourism board, though, is hoping to increase that to 13.5 million next year. We'll see.</p><p>Some days, you are too sick to work. Other days, you're simply sick off work. And like Ferris Bueller, you just need a day off. From counterfeit colds to fraudulent flus, you won't believe how far some people go to avoid their job. Stick around for \"Spare Change.\" You can never have too much MONEY or too many sick excuses.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Time for some fun on \"Spare Change.\" Today, we are joined by Veronica Dagher and David Asman. Thanks for joining us. Happy Halloween. We're all in red even though it's Halloween. All right.</p><p>So, it's that time of year, holidays are approaching. Everyone's just counting how many sick days they have left for the year. What better way to spend this Halloween night than breaking down the most outlandish sick day excuses ever because there's going to be a lot of people calling in sick tomorrow when they stay out late in Halloween. It's a Friday. What's the worst sick excuse you've ever used? David, have you lied and said you were --</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS: You know, I honestly have to say --</p><p>FRANCIS: Come on.</p><p>ASMAN: No, no, no, I actually come in. I'm one of these crazy people who loves to work. I actually came in. I had the worst hangover in my life, so bad --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: And came in anyway?</p><p>ASMAN: It took me about two hours to walk one block because I felt like I was 104. And I came in anyway. But once I get to my desk, my head fell down. We used to work at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I used to work to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" I used to work there, and the editor of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" who never came to my office, that one day he came in.</p><p>And luckily, he knew the guy that I'd been drinking with the night before, and I said, I'm sorry, I was out with so and so, and he said, OK, put your head back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Veronica, you have no hope of topping that story.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I really don't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm hoping that you're not the person -- one of the most outlandish excuses that we saw on the Career Builder survey which is, you know, one of the reasons why we're doing this, couldn't make it to work because his false teeth flew out the window while he was driving down the highway.</p><p>ASMAN: That's a good --</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think that guy was telling the truth?</p><p>ASMAN: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: Or do you think something else happened, and they made up that crazy excuse? What do you think, Veronica?</p><p>DAGHER: He's crazy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER: Why would you even share that even if it was true?</p><p>FRANCIS: If it's true, why would you share it?</p><p>DAGHER: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you have to be lying. That's my thought with something like that, right?</p><p>DAGHER: Yes. I mean, I could see that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thirty-three percent of people who called out sick, according to Career Builder, just didn't feel like going to work.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: They called and said they were sick.</p><p>ASMAN: Actually, seriously, I did once when I was at \"The Journal,\" I had to fire somebody because she was always using excuses. But I don't think they were -- this was before the days of all the surveillance devices and everything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: -- posting on Facebook. I mean, they call in sick and then they tweet or they post on Facebook --</p><p>ASMAN: Well, that's it. You can prove it now. In my day, you couldn't necessarily prove it quite as easily. But now, you can prove it. Certainly, if they post anything on Facebook. And I do know of one person who was caught at a baseball game, and they were seen --</p><p>FRANCIS: According to a survey, 30 percent of employers check on employees, either ask them for a doctor's note or they look on social media to see if they really sick when they say -- so word to the wise out there. The first Monday in February is the most popular day for employees to call out sick.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: See, I think that makes total sense because you go through the holidays and you have a great time. You come back in January, and you hit -- you're like, ah, we don't have a day off or anything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, either that or it's the Super Bowl.</p><p>ASMAN: Oh, bingo. That's it. Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. People call in -- but I always think -- I mean, I'm always amazed, I do notice people calling in the day after the Super Bowl, and I'm shocked --</p><p>ASMAN: By the way, you mentioned the false teeth. My favorite one is the guy who called in sick because he said a swarm of bees had surrounded his car, and he couldn't get out. Oh, my goodness!</p><p>FRANCIS: There it is.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, he had proof, i didn't know that.</p><p>FRANCIS: He had proof of it, but obviously, he called someone on a phone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Anyway, all right. Thanks, guys. \"Who Made Money Today?\" It sure is a beautiful day for him and his investors. Not sure who it is? We'll have the answer right after this. You can never have too much MONEY or too many sick excuses.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made Money today.\" Once again, everyone who owns Facebook. Company reported strong third quarter earnings. Social media giant says it swung to a profit with 60 percent revenue growth, beating the street's expectations. Investors decided they aren't overly concerned about a big decline in daily use by younger teens. And Facebook stock closed up almost 2.5 percent today.</p><p>Rock star, Bono, and his investment group, Elevation Partners, owns about 40 million shares of Facebook. They made a very impressive 48 million bucks today. I would take that. Not bad.</p><p>Also making money today, a 67 year-old man in Orlando, Florida who just won his second multimillion-dollar lotto in two years. The Florida Lottery says James Boseman Jr. (ph) hit the jackpot for a three million bucks. Last year, he won 10 million bucks. He bought both tickets from the same 7/11. Fun fact. He didn't use the same numbers. In case you're wondering, the odds of a double win like that are about one in 196 trillion.</p><p>And not spending money, on the Fresno State Basketball team's opening game, everyone who's going. That's because Indiana Pacers all-star, Paul George, bought every single ticket to his Alma Matters first game. The \"Fresno Business Journal\" reports all George purchased all 15,596 seats at the Save Mart Center.</p><p>And season-ticket holders won't have to worry. They'll have the same seats for the game. It's the NBA star's way of giving back to his former college. And the low estimate for what it costs him, about $265,000. Though given that, he just signed a contract extension worth $90 million over five years, I guess, he can afford it.</p><p>That's all we've got for you. I hope you made MONEY today. You've got to watch tomorrow. Our money talker is all about how you should really dress for work. What about those short skirts and too tight dresses? How about the CEO who says women who wear high heels have no brains? Those are fighting words, and we are all over it. That is tomorrow. \"The Willis Report\" is coming up next.

It's  happening more and more, because when they say it's not, it's always about  money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sure, we all love going online to find the best deal, but usually  we're talking about a hotel room, a flight, a television.  Would you feel  comfortable accepting online bid for hip replacement from a doctor you  never met?  It is newest wave in comparison shopping and the Web site  METABID (ph) giving people chance to evaluate offers from doctors across  the country and then travel to get the care of their choice.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to discuss how it all works, the president, Ralph Weber.  </p><p>Ralph, what is the experience, I go online what happens?  </p><p>RALPH WEBER, PRESIDENT, METABID:  Well, you go online and make a  request.  Now, it depend if you work for employer that uses met at that bid  as source care or just an individual.  So, you make a request and you can  put in your parameters, a few health questions, you know, your height, your  weight, any medication allergies.  You can put in how far you're willing to  travel, if at all.  And then you request a bid.  You can review all the  doctors' profiles.  So you see where they went to medical school, what  their training was, what their experience is.  How many of these procedures  they do every year.  So you really get to see a lot about the quality of  the doctor, as you make the request.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  wow.  </p><p>WEBER:  --which with traditional insurance, all you know is in network  or out of network.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  You really don't know that much.  I mean, although you  are able to ask people in your community, generally, especially if your  community is smaller that everybody sort of knows everybody.  I have a lot  of questions about all that.  </p><p>OK.  So, if I'm an individual do I have to join and pay a fee in order  to go look at my employer is not a member?  </p><p>WEBER:  Yes, if your employer is not a member, you can pay $25 just  for one request or join $4.95 per month.  And then $4.95 per month is a  one-year commitment and then you can go on anytime you like to make a  request.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you know, the biggest question, I'm sure, that everyone  in the audience has what kind of doctors do you have on the network?  I  mean, does it include everyone?  Is it just a small group?  I mean, what  percentage would you say of the doctors in America are available in your  Web site?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, not a huge percentage.  We look for doctors that are not  the mainstream big box type of providers.  Doctors prefer getting cash at  the time of care.  The traditional insurance model where they will, you  know, charge one price that is called the charge master.  And then they  carry a re-prices it to the allowable, and then they're paid a portion of  that.  It sometimes takes 120 days or so for them to get their money.  So,  the doctors like getting paid at the time of the care.  And also they get  to set their own prices.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>WEBER:  With traditional insurance they're told what they would be  paid that is it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  No, that is interesting.  They get to set their own prices  to see what the market will bear.  A lot of our viewers tweeted in and  said, you know, it is very normal for people to travel to Sloane Kettering  or to travel to MD Anderson for cancer treatment.  So, they're familiar  with the idea of traveling to big.  Do you have big names like that on your  site?  </p><p>WEBER:  Yes.  As a matter of fact, we do Baylor in Houston, MD  Anderson is participating on very small level.  We have talked to Kerlin  Jobe in Los Angeles.  They kind of were looking at it.  They haven't made a  final evaluation.  So absolutely, and we have overseas facility like in  (INAUDIBLE) and Bangkok.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Let me ask you about how some financials work, OK.  So, say  I get to -- the doctor looks great online, you know, I look at it -- for  whatever you can tell.  I mean, have the same problem when I'm on my own  health network and you are looking, you see their education.  But until you  go see them, you don't really know them.  So, say you get out there and you  meet them or you see hospital and don't feel good about it.  What happens  then?  Do you lose the travel money?  How do the financials work?  </p><p>WEBER:  OK, well, I mean, if you paid for your own flight, then, yes,  I mean you've had sort of two-day vacation I guess or whatever.  I mean, it  is not much different than if you looked in the yellow pages and went to MD  Anderson or the local, you know, corner hospital either way.  I mean, if  you get there, you don't like the physician for whatever reason.  </p><p>Now keep in mind you've had a lot of transactions before you get to  there.  A lot of doctors when they respond to a bid they will say, OK, you  know, before we go through this, maybe we should have a phone call or talk  on Skype or something like that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>WEBER:  So usually by the time you get there you've actually kind of  met the person, sort of online.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And how does insurance play into this?  Because there a  couple of articles that I was reading about this, they were saying that in  some cases your insurance company will pay for to you fly to another place  if it is significantly cheaper for then.  How do you get your insurance  company involved in shopping for prices?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, a lot of people use private third party administrators  where they have more flexibility and it has to be right in the plan  document where it will allow.  Some of the big carriers won't actually  allow you to negotiate a better price without considering it out of network  which means you pay more of a deductible.  So, you have to make sure your  plan is set up to wraparound this kind of travel arrangement.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>WEBER:  I mean, if you're getting a knee replacement for 21,000 versus  70, it would be foolish for the carrier not to cover.  So, it was self- funded employers where they can do this.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What is the most common type of surgery people are traveling  for?  What do you see the most?  Because I imagine it isn't emergency  surgery where people are price comparing.  </p><p>WEBER:  No.  That is true.  Our app is not quite fast enough to work  in the ambulance.  </p><p>A lot of people are using knee replacement, hip replacement,  colonoscopies.  Those are some of our more common.  Rotator cuff repair, we  are getting a lot of requests for cosmetic procedures.  But I think  orthopedic would be the most common surgery because they're mostly  preplanned.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  </p><p>No, it's a very interesting model because of course we're going  through these dramatic changes in health care.  People are trying to figure  out, you know, as they're forced to bear more of a burden of the cost, how  they can make it cheaper for themselves.  Here in New York a lot of doctors  stopped taking insurance all together and gone to all cash because the  system is so hard to deal with.  </p><p>WEBER:  Yes.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, an application like yours I can see it gaining a lot of  popularity as people, you know, realize they're really out there on their  own trying to fend for themselves.  </p><p>Ralph Weber, great stuff, thank you so much.  Very interesting.  </p><p>WEBER:  And it is not just about price though, Melissa.  It is not  just about price.  I mean, when you go to hotels.com, you don't look for a  motel 6.  It is sometimes about access.  Sometimes crossing a state line,  different medical board has different medical regulations with drastically  can increase or decrease the cost.  So, it is about accessing and choice  and getting the doctor that you want rather than the one that covers you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  No, that is a great point.  I'm glad you added that.  </p><p>Ralph, I think it is the wave of the future.  Thank you so much for  coming on.  </p><p>WEBER:  Thank you, Melissa.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next, it won't be long before we're all driving i-cars.   Who can help Apple win the race?  Stick around.  </p><p>And people piling on the bandwagon saying oracle's Larry Ellison is  making too damn much.  It is all the word on Wall Street.  We got the scoop  coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What did I tell you?  88 miles per hour!  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS:  They did it.  Forget the Delorean (ph), Dr. Brown.  Dr.  Brown should try the i-car.  </p><p>German analyst is now pushing for a partnership between Apple and  Tesla saying the tech giant should buy Elon Musk's car company, maybe now  is the right time.  The electric car maker West Coast Supercharger Corridor  is officially open for business.  So Model S owners can travel between San  Diego, California, and Vancouver, Canada, without worry.  But is the buyout  a good or bad idea?  </p><p>Jean Jennings, editor-in-chief for \"Automobile\" magazine and Dan  Ferris is an analyst with Stansberry and Associates.  </p><p>Jean, let me start with you, is this a match made in heaven, the i-car  courtesy of Tesla?  </p><p>JEAN JENNINGS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE:  Well, you know,  for Elon Musk, it might be because he himself has said their company is has  a higher valuation than we rightly deserve.  So, for him it might be the  perfect time.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  Dan, what do you think?  </p><p>DAN FERRIS, ANALYST, STANSBERRY AND ASSOCIATES:  I think Tesla would  be a really bad investment for Apple.  Set aside arguments whether or not  the technologies work together.  Tesla is a horrible investment.  It is an  unprofitable company in one of most capital intensive, ultracompetitive low  margin industries in the world.  Not a good idea.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Well, let me try to make some of the arguments why it  might make sense, Dan.  I mean, if you look at Apple, stockholder have  fallen out of love with Apple basically since the passing of Steve Jobs.   Maybe they need that injection, that magic factor.  They need the  charismatic person to be back in the company, dreaming up new inventions  and making Apple what it was.  Couldn't Elon Musk be that kind of creative,  driving force, who could bring the imagination and the love back to Apple?   No, you're shaking your head already.  Ready to shoot me down.  Let me have  it.  </p><p>FERRIS:  Well look, here's the problem, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, not  the same, OK?  Steve Jobs is revolutionized four industries, right, music,  phones, movies and computers.  And all those are insanely profitable  businesses today.  And Elon Musk is enamored with these kind of very  cutting-edge, I mean, he is a dreamer, right?  But very cutting-edge  technologies and he is not making money at it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Jean, Elon is making a whole lot of money for e-bay  through PayPal.  I mean, PayPal was definitely a $8 home run.  Jean, what  do you think?  </p><p>JENNINGS:  Right.  So, you know, I think Dan has a lot of great  points.  But let's talk about what Elon has done in an industry that  basically no individual is capable of actually making a car like he has  done.  He has been incredibly successful.  I mean, he has had a hell of a  month.  He has just done a deal with Panasonic to produce batteries.  He  has done a deal with AT&amp;T wireless to provide internet connectivity.  He  has done his corridor but he has done the big trio of big moves.  Number  one, he got two of the four major car magazines in America to name that car  an \"Automobile\" magazine's case, automobile of the year.  \"Motor Trend\" car  of the year, because it was flat-out the best and most exciting car  produced last year.  </p><p>In addition to that, \"Consumer Reports\" has just given it a  recommended rating, the same rating they took away from Camry and said it  was one of the highest, highest place-getting tests they have ever done in  their history.  Ninety-nine out of 100 points, just performance-wise.  In  addition to that, the last piece of that NHTSA safety rating.  Five stars  in every single category.  NHTSA said it is highest rated, safest car they  have ever -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  -- of all time it has ever happened.  </p><p>Dan -- but the problem, I think Dan is going to say to you, show me  the money.  I mean, unless you own the stock they are not selling a whole  bunch of these cars, they are not making a bunch of these cars.  Right,  Dan?  </p><p>FERRIS:  Exactly.  Exactly.  </p><p>JENNINGS:  No argument.  </p><p>FERRIS:  You know, it is a $90,000 car.  Yes.  But here is a thing.  </p><p>Look.  Let's say the three of us owned Apple all together, OK?  We're  bringing in 45 billion in cash flow a year, free cash flow, biggest non- financial free cash flow stream in the world.  And then, I come to you too,  and I say hey, let's spend the 25 or 30 billion we need to take over Tesla?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But Dan, what is the next i-device?  I mean, they need the  next big idea.  They need the next revenue stream.  They need something  beyond the phone, the ipad, the computer.  Your car, it is the logical  extension.  That is why German analyst came up with the idea that Apple  needs the next thing is i-car, why not?  Go ahead.  Let me have it.  </p><p>FERRIS:  No, the i-car, look this technology will be in cars one day,  we don't argue that point.  But the next thing will probably be, the next  category is probably going to be TV, right?  That would be the next  category.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But they have already got Apple TV.  I mean, they're already  working on that.  They're perfecting it.  We're going beyond TV.  The next  thing is the car.  </p><p>Jean, go ahead.  </p><p>FERRIS:  But it is not a real i-TV though.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead, Jean.  </p><p>JENNINGS:  Next thing is the future of transportation which is going  to be the connected car and it is the autonomous car.  There is no doubt  about it.  And all of -- </p><p>FERRIS:  Agreed.  </p><p>JENNINGS:  All of the technology involved that is involved in this is  in place now.  So it is a matter of knitting it all together.  The next  technology is -- work on that Elon.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Dan, you hate the idea of Apple doing cars or do you hate  idea of them partnering with Elon Musk?  </p><p>FERRIS:  I don't hate the idea of them partnering with Musk.  I hate  the idea of Apple spending the 25 or 30 billion you would need to do buy a  company that burns 330 million a year in cash.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Very fair point because at end of the day it is all about  money.  And you boiled it down to the dollars and I love that we'll end the  segment there.  </p><p>Thanks to both of you, great job.  </p><p>FERRIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>JENNINGS:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, that was billionaire Larry Ellison is making too much  money at expense of Oracle shareholders.  Pension fund are piling on saying  hell yes.  It is all the word on Wall Street.  </p><p>Plus, is Target setting a sight on job seekers with checkered pasts.   We will tell you why they are rolling out the welcome mat to workers with  criminal records.  </p><p>Do you have too much \"Money?\"  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Now, it is time for juiciest part of the day, the whispers,  the rumors, what is truer?  What is going on behind closed doors?   Investors up in arms over Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's pay, shareholders and  pensions, are teaming together to wage a campaign opposing the re-election  of some of the company's directors at today's annual meeting.  And the fury  is growing, let me tell you.  </p><p>It is about whether Ellison is making too much money at shareholders  expense.  We got all the dirty details in today's word on Wall Street.  </p><p>With me now, Spencer Jakab and Brian Sozzi.  </p><p>Guys, thanks for joining me.  I mean, this is turning -- Larry Ellison  has always attracted a little too much attention to himself with everything  that he is doing, whether it enormous yachts, enormous pay day.  Is it  finally catching up to him?  Spencer, what do you think?  </p><p>SPENCER JAKAB, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  It definitely is not  his behavior that is catching up to him because he has been playing ball  for a long time.  And that is why when he is making you money, that's fine.   The stock is only up a couple of percent this year, not doing so great.   And actually, you know, for years, you know, there have been complains  about him being highest paid CEO, most years being highest paid CEO.  He  gets a salary of one dollar like a lot of guys.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  But if you look at total compensation, I mean, and  we have a full screen to that to show people.  If you look at direct  compensation and you compare it to other big CEOs in the same industry,  Larry Ellison, you know, out there, there you go.  Larry Ellison, 94.6  million.  And that is his salary but that is also -- I mean, most of it is  his option and his stock and everything else.  </p><p>Paul Otellini, John Chambers, Tim Cook, Steve Ballmer, I mean, all a  tiny fraction of that.  You even go to people like Jamie Dimon, you know,  11.5 million.  Nothing is even close to what Larry Ellison --  </p><p>Brian, why is he getting that much money again?  </p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELLUS CAPITAL ADVISORS:  Our time slices is got to  shred.  First of all, it is hard to argue with it first of all because the  stock, market cap is almost over doubled since May 2003.  So, in many  respects he earned it.  But what are you getting for oracle?  You are  paying for past performance like the shrug who hit the free agent market.   And here is one stat to share, on Twitter, Oracle shares since mid 2010  have actually underperformed the Dow, right, sap and Nasdaq.  Oracle is a  little tech stock.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  No, absolutely.  I mean, when you look at it over the  long run it has done well, but if you look at it, you know, year-to-date,  last year, three months, one month, anyway you slice it, it is lagging the  S&amp;P and in some cases by a lot.  You are the day that stand about three in  the third percent while the S&amp;P is up 20 percent.  So it is just, you know  - </p><p>SOZZI:  And that is just the performance of the company.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And so, Spencer, maybe it is time for him to go?  </p><p>JAKAB:  It is not so, it is time for him to go.  But if you look at  what does Larry Ellison bring to Oracle?  I mean, he was the force behind  it.  He was the person pushing it.  Today, you know, you can't, he is not  analogous to Steve Jobs.  He is not indispensable person.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>JAKAB:  It happens to be the owner of about a quarter of the stock and  one of the richest men in the world.  He is worth about $40 billion.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is the inspiration, the driver, I mean, is he the person  that the company is really all about?  You look, I mean, at what Steve Jobs  was, of course, but then you look at other people where the company is  really about them.  Martha Stewart, I mean, you know, is he the guy who is  the driving force behind the company or is the company almost independent  of him now?  </p><p>Brain, what do you think?  </p><p>SOZZI:  Well, I sure hope not because the fact is he has made a lot of  bad acquisitions, and if I'm shareholder I'm worried about how the guy is  spending his money or their money on all his acquisitions over the past  year.  He is running sailing events.  If you look at the Ford structure of  Oracle, they only have two independent directors.  They have the head of  the -- Chairman of the company is former employee.  They need more  independent directors on Oracle's board.  </p><p>And third of all, look at Mark Hurd.  He is the guy who made inherit  this whole entire company.  Is he going to step in the face of Larry  Ellison, and say hey you're making too much, probably not.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  No.  And that is really what they are saying.  It is they  are saying that we need to get -- before we even tackle the issue of Larry  Ellison, we have to tackle the issue of the board which is totally beholden  to him, and he is doing exactly what he wants.  When you see somebody who  is making $94 million a year, you know, big U.K. pension fund among those  pressing for changes.  You have Calpers, the California state retirement  system.  I mean, they're powerful.  They own 11.5 million shares.  New York  City, for example, 10.3 million shares.  Everybody is clamoring for a  change in the board to begin with.  Do you think the move will be  successful?  </p><p>JAKAB:  No.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  No?  </p><p>JAKAB:  I don't think it will be successful because you have already  votes that have been really damning.  You had votes on say on pay and they  said thanks but no thanks, you know.  We kind of -- we like the way that we  are paying him.  </p><p>So, it is very, very difficult, especially with the CEO controlling  quarter of the stock and so many people --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, it this live lagging?  I mean, maybe this is the  problem for the stock.  Is it the bad acquisition or is it this idea that  you have somebody who is running it, who is just out of control?  </p><p>SOZZI:  You are right, Melissa.  And it is because of all the  acquisition.  And I point to last year, they put up 12 percent pre-tax  operating profit increase.  What he need beneath the surface, he actually  with many respects high single digit.  Why is that happening?  Because you  require a lot of business like Sun Microsystems in 2008, to high a price,  had to write it down, business underperforming.  This guy has to go.  Time  for new blood.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, he bought (INAUDIBLE) of the Hawaiian Islands.  I  mean, obviously, you know, there is a lot of resort there.  It was an  investment.  But it is very high-profile thing to do.  I mean, his bank  rolled two victories of America's cup.  He missed his developers'  conference.  That was a huge deal.  We were talking about that before  because of America's cup.  He has a $200 Million Japanese-themed compound  in Silicon Valley.  Should he tone down his life-style a little bit as he  sees the tide turning against him?  Would it help or is it too late?  What  is the scuttlebutt?  </p><p>JAKAB:  It looks bad, for sure, to buy a Hawaiian Island, to not  attend your developers' conference.  The keynote that I think 40,000 people  had traveled.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You don't seem like the $94 million a year man when you are  doing that.  </p><p>JAKAB:  No, you don't.  No, it doesn't look good at all.  But his  behavior is not egregious enough yet to have --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  </p><p>JAKAB:  Exactly because he is just too much wrapped up in associate  with the company.  I don't think you are going to see that.  I think, you  know, once he does something that is really embarrassing or he gets  becomes, you know, too old to really hang on -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Brian, do you agree?  </p><p>SOZZI:  I am very worried.  The fact that he is thinking about buying  islands, thinking about sailing yachts, and this is the man in charge of  the corporate strategy, of acquisition of the company, same strategy,  inspiration, means after buying islands, he is worried about worrying how  in committee to mow a lawn at one of these islands.  That is not good.  You  don't want to see that as a shareholder.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, guy.  Thank you so much.  Great job!  </p><p>All right, up next, thinking of filling out a job application at  target?  You won't have to answer that pesky criminal history question  anymore.  Should they make it easier for ex-cons to get jobs?  Tweet me and  tell what you think.  It is today's money talker.  </p><p>And \"who made \"Money\" today?\"  The international icon is sure walking  on to a whole lot of cash.  You got to keep watching to find out who it is.  </p><p>We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  If you've got a criminal past and you were searching for a  job, Target -- hey, it might be just the place to look.  That is because  now target will not ask if you've been convicted of a crime on their  initial job application.  Target is not the only one.  An unbelievable ten  states and 51 cities have signed some version of this practice into law.   It's got a lot of people fired up.  So, of course, it is today's money  talk.  </p><p>Joining us now, and not submitting to a background check, by the way,  Susan Sullivan, Bill Farmkin and our very own Dennis Kneale.  </p><p>Dennis, you're mad about this?  You are fired up?  </p><p>DENNIS KNEALE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  You know what?  This is now the  new politically correct, wonderful cause of liberals everywhere.  Let's  pass a law, an actual law telling companies that they're not allowed to ask  applicants at first glance, hey, you have been arrested or convicted of a  crime.  I say why don't you let companies figure that out instead of  dictating to them.</p><p>And our federal EEOC is at the forefront of that.  It sued BMW.  It  sued Dollar General because they use screening programs that kind of faired  out convicted or arrested (ph).  They said the impact of that is racist.   And while the intent is not racist, if the impact of it is racist --  disparate impact, when then, by golly, your policies are illegal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let him have it.</p><p>SUSAN SOLOVIC, SMALL BUSINESS EXPERT:  No one would ever accuse me of  being a liberal, trust me.  But did you know that one out of four American  adults have either an arrest record or a conviction?  So, you are just -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  So what?  So what?  So what?  So, put it on your  application.  They're not screened out.  You're just putting it on your  application.</p><p>SOLOVIC:  But I think that there probably is a predisposition to see  that they're screened out.  The problem with that is, what if it's a minor  infraction?  What if it was a kid who got busted for drugs at an early -- </p><p>KNEALE:  Well, then let the company go ahead and make an exception.   Let it decide to instead of some government -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILL FRUMKIN, EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY:  It is absolutely right.  The  concept is there are laws in many states separate and apart from anti- discrimination laws that say that if you have a criminal background or  criminal problem, it has to be related to the job for which you're not  eligible for.</p><p>For example, if you were busted for having a joint ten years ago and  now you want to be a cashier, what does that have to do with it?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why does it hurt the employer to know?  I mean, the employer  can say, hey, guess what, that has nothing to do with whether or not you're  going to be -- </p><p>FRUMKIN:  Because that can't be the reason.  The reason has to be some  other reason.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC:  It has to be a justifiable reason.  The other thing is I  used to practice divorce law, I tell you what, divorce makes the sanest  person go nuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SOLOVIC:  There's a lot of he said/she said when it comes to divorces.   If there is a little domestic dispute, that's the only thing on that  person's record, I'm sorry, I'm going to give them some slack.</p><p>FRANCIS:  The flip side, I mean, I have the right to know if  somebody's robbed a bank, I don't want them managing my cash -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, that's what target is talking about this idea that  they're not going to check the box.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  No, but the point is they won't check the box, but in the  interview, OK, it may come out.  I mean, they may be able to find out from  that screening point.  It's not that they can't consider it all, but the  truth is, has to be job related.</p><p>And just to talk about discrimination for a moment, the bottom line is  that if one in seven African-American males end up in the criminal justice  system and one in 30 Caucasian males end up in the criminal justice system,  this is a facially-neutral way essentially to keep people out -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't buy that at all.  A job is a privilege, it's not a  right.  Employers are in business to make a profit.  They get to choose who  they have in their store working for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  -- there's something about this.  Government always so well  with intended, it's cruel, because what they're going to do now is the  companies are not allowed.  In Minnesota, they're not allowed to ask -- </p><p>SOLOVIC:  That's not true.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  If I can finish -- and then what's going to happen is after  they find out that I was convicted and I got my hopes up, they're going to  dash my dreams and not hire me.</p><p>SOLOVIC:  That is not true.  It has got to be fact-sensitive, and you  are just taking this and making it too simplistic.  All they're doing is  saying we're going to at least look into this.  If the candidate becomes a  serious candidate, they have every right -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- up front then.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC:  Because they don't know what it is.  It says check the box - - </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  -- leave it up to companies to be intelligent enough to  figure out how they want to handle it.  Why should government come in and  dictate a list of -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hold on, guys.  Why should government come in and dictate to  -- </p><p>FRUMKIN:  Because government requires minimum wage laws, and  government requires overtime laws and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  -- women that we don't discriminate against, you know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  -- because a company wants to know if a person has been  arrested?  Exactly -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  They've broken the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC:  It has a disparaging -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But even if it isn't disparate impact, the bottom line is  this, do you want people coming out of jail or coming out and being  convicted and never to work again?</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's right.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  They'll never getting entitlements and then they'll be  getting all these other things.  What about taxpayers being functioning in  society?  That's the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  Wait a minute.  I don't hear you guys worrying about  entitlements on any other issue, so you can't now use it on your side when  you -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  What about the idea don't you guys realize, government is  telling us what to do more and more and more.  Government is in our face  telling us you've got to have not just any insurance, you've got to have  this insurance, telling us -- pretty soon they're going to be telling us --  put our left leg pants on in the morning before the right leg.  how about  just letting business breathe free and -- </p><p>SOLOVIC:  It I wish that were the -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Amen!  I am weeping.  I am weeping.  Go ahead.  Respond -- </p><p>SOLOVIC:  You are being so idealistic.  That is never going to happen.   We are talking about one little box on an application that -- </p><p>KNEALE:  If it's one little box, then what are you guys so worried  about?</p><p>SOLOVIC:  Because -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  -- jobs for the people who have not been arrested and  convicted of a crime.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOVIC:  You have children.  What if your child in college gets  busted for having marijuana -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KNEALE:  Should my daughter not ever have to pay a price for what  she's done wrong?</p><p>FRUMKIN:  For the rest of her life and not work?</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's it.  They're saying for the rest of their life not  work.  They're saying -- </p><p>KNEALE:  Let an employer ask.</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- so you have to report that going forward.  Guys, you were  great.  Thank you so much.  What a spirited discussion.  Hoo!</p><p>All right.  Coming up, he played one of the most influential engineers  ever, and now, a top computer company is hiring Ashton Kutcher as a product  engineer.  What?  We're going to go behind the scenes to see if they might  be confusing him with the real Steve Jobs.  Stay right where you are.  At  the end of the day, it is all about MONEY and heat here on this set!</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, TV's highest paid actor scores a new gig.  Ashton  Kutcher is joining forces with Lenovo but not to just simply sell the  products as an actual engineer.  Kutcher could work with the computer  company to offer advice on design and software for its yoga tablets.  It is  a trend in the endorsement industry using their brains behind the  popularity.</p><p>Here now are celebrity journalist, David Caplan, and tech expert, Todd  Haselton.  Thanks to both of you for joining us.</p><p>David, what do you think?  I mean, this is an interesting one, because  Ashton, you know, I mean, he's a renowned investor.  He's gotten in a lot  of things early, Air B&amp;B, you know, a lot of big tech companies.  He's not  a lightweight in the tech field.  At the same time, I have a hard time  imaging him actually, you know, designing tablets.</p><p>DAVID CAPLAN, CELEBRITY JOURNALIST:  Well, you know, there's two  things.  First of all, he's an influencer which is a word that's bandied  around a lot in the celebrity world meaning he's an influence.  You know,  Lenovo's great for him.  He's perceived as young, he's cutting edge, and I  think Ashton Kutcher, he's huge on Twitter.  He talks a lot about  technology.</p><p>So, first of all, he's already perceived as having that street cred,  but then you want to cross that line, well, does he actually have the  street cred to do it, and he seems to be a real tech-savvy guy.  Listen, he  may not be in the actually drafting these things, but when it comes to  ideas, I mean, he's on top of the trends.  He knows what people want.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I guess.  But, Todd, I mean, I don't actually know a human  being that owns a yoga whatever it is or anything -- </p><p>CAPLAN:  Now, you will because of Ashton.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD HASELTON, TECHNOBUFFALO EXEC. DIR. OF MOBILE:  -- yoga products  are sort of the ones that are tablets and computer, and they've -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>HASELTON:  No.  I don't know -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you know a person who owns one?</p><p>CAPLAN:  No.</p><p>HASELTON:  But to make a point here, I think as Lenovo tries to expand  its market share in the United States, it needs a face to do that.  And  Ashton Kutcher can be that face, but I don't think he's necessarily the  right person -- I don't think he's going to be an engineer back there  actually coding, although, he suggested that yes, he does have a background  in that.</p><p>He has worked closely with start-ups to do so, but I think it's more a  play on Lenovos' to get a U.S. presence especially as they move into U.S.  smartphones -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  And they are -- I mean, the point of this, though, the  larger point, is that consumers are very savvy now.  And just having  someone out there, you know, hawking your product doesn't get it done.  I  mean, when you look at -- who was it that was out there trying to sell --  Alicia Keys -- Alicia Keys out there.  She's saying, you know, that she's  Blackberry, Blackberry's really cool, Blackberry is not, you know, your  grandfather's device from work.</p><p>It's actually cool for young people, and she's doing all this from her  iPhone, and she gets busted along the way.  And consumers are very savvy to  understand that when you put a celebrity out there, they're just doing it  for the dollars.  So, they're trying to act like they're more integrated  into the actual product.  Lady Gaga, for example.</p><p>CAPLAN:  Polaroid (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>CAPLAN:  I mean, but I think, you know, again, for her, that's  actually a good match  because -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  What is she actually doing for Polaroid? </p><p>CAPLAN:  She's their creative director.  So, you know, she is a very  creative person.  So, for example, she'll maybe design sort of special  edition Polaroid cameras.  She'll be partaking their advertising -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  In what sense?  I mean, is she there making drawings -- </p><p>CAPLAN:  I know how this works.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think?</p><p>CAPLAN:  I mean, she really is suggesting ideas like, hey, you know,  the camera should have this -- you know, be this color, should be pink with  this trim.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you think they're all rolling their eyes behind her back  while she's standing at this meeting saying that people, like yes, whatever  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HASELTON:  That's exactly what's going on.  And I think that Ashton  actually is going to have to prove himself.  If he goes to China, which he  said he was going there this week, he has to show engineers that he knows  what he's talking about.  And it's on the company to show not tell (ph),  not simply -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  And he says he has his engineering background.  Well  -- </p><p>CAPLAN:  He dropped out of school.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  He went to, what was it, University of Iowa.  He was  in biochemical engineering.  That was his major before he dropped out.  I  mean, biochemical engineering is not the same thing as what he's doing now  -- </p><p>HASELTON:  And he admitted to partying too hard in school.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  And he was doing it because his twin brother has a  lot of ailments, so he was looking at medicine.  I mean, that's like a far  cry from what he's doing now.  That that doesn't mean that he has any  expertise whatsoever in designing hardware.</p><p>HASELTON:  I agree, absolutely.</p><p>CAPLAN:  But you know, I will say, you know, I wouldn't necessarily,  though, overestimate the public because just as much as some people are  star struck (ph) when they see a celebrity endorsement, a celebrity  endorsement is huge.  While a lot of people are going to be turned off, I  mean, every day there's someone new being signed to something.  And -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Did he sell a lot of cool pix?  Wasn't that what he was -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAPLAN:  Yes.  You know, and it worked great for them.  There's a  whole other category of people out there, specifically, younger people.   They like Ashton -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON:  -- front and center in the Best Buy, right?  So, they're  going to walk in to Best Buy and say, oh, an icon.  But Lenovo's not so  well known name in the United States.  Blackberry was on its way out.   That's why it didn't work with Alicia Keys.  So, you have to look at the  business where it's going anyway.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But this is the new trend in advertising.  I mean, without  question -- well, no, it's not.  I mean, if you look at something that --  Kim Kardashian tweeting about something different every single day, and  people understand she's being paid for that tweet.  She probably has no  idea what the product is, doesn't use it, doesn't matter.</p><p>That now consumers are demanding something a little bit more  authentic, and if you look at other partnerships.  I mean, you look at Dr.  Dre with the Beatz head phones, working with HP to develop, you know,  better sound technology.  Here's a celebrity who knows something who does  actually know something about the technology -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HASELTON:  So, he worked in studios, right?  So, he knows what to do  with headphones.  But then, you look at Ashton Kutcher.  I haven't seen him  working on laptop.  I mean -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>HASELTON:  You know, he works with start-ups, but not with a laptop.   And windows is the problem here.  I think people are driving towards that,  so what's he going to do to improve windows?  That's a Microsoft problem,  not a Lenovo one.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting.  All right.  Yes.  None of us know a human  being (ph), you know, anything Lenovo -- </p><p>CAPLAN:  By that, we will now, though.  It's come a long way, though.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  Let's check back in six months and see if we  still don't know anyone who owns Lenovo or anything.  All right.  Thanks,  guys.  Happy Halloween, by the way.</p><p>All right.  From the U.S., every corner of the globe, MONEY has been  flying around the world today.</p><p>First to Syria, inspectors there have completed the destruction of  machinery used to produce chemical weapons.  The organization for the  prohibition of chemical weapon which just won the Nobel Peace Prize you  might remember is overseeing the process.  It says in a statement that it  has, quote, \"verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared chemical  weapons production equipment.  No word, of course, on Syria's undeclared  chemical weapons stash.</p><p>On to England where the public is about to get access to a database  aimed at busting tax evaders.  The new database contains company ownership  details.  In an effort to expose international money laundering and tax  evasion schemes, the information is specific to those with 25 percent or  more of a company's shares or voting rights.</p><p>By making it public, the British government is hoping to put pressure  on firms and individuals trying to hide money and profits.  We'll see if  that works.</p><p>All right.  Landing in Egypt, the country's tourism board is launching  an ambitious campaign to lure back visitors that haven't been scared off by  the political turmoil there.  Yes, those pictures not helping with tourism.   You'd think being home to one of the wonders of the world would be a big  enough draw, but Egypt has lost $2.5 billion in revenue since the  revolution began in 2011.</p><p>About eleven and a half million tourists visited Egypt in 2012.  The  tourism board, though, is hoping to increase that to 13.5 million next  year.  We'll see.</p><p>Some days, you are too sick to work.  Other days, you're simply sick  off work.  And like Ferris Bueller, you just need a day off.  From  counterfeit colds to fraudulent flus, you won't believe how far some people  go to avoid their job.  Stick around for \"Spare Change.\"  You can never  have too much MONEY or too many sick excuses.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Time for some fun on \"Spare Change.\"  Today, we are joined  by Veronica Dagher and David Asman.  Thanks for joining us.  Happy  Halloween.  We're all in red even though it's Halloween.  All right.</p><p>So, it's that time of year, holidays are approaching.  Everyone's just  counting how many sick days they have left for the year.  What better way  to spend this Halloween night than breaking down the most outlandish sick  day excuses ever because there's going to be a lot of people calling in  sick tomorrow when they stay out late in Halloween.  It's a Friday.  What's  the worst sick excuse you've ever used?  David, have you lied and said you  were -- </p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  You know, I honestly have to say -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Come on.</p><p>ASMAN:  No, no, no, I actually come in.  I'm one of these crazy people  who loves to work.  I actually came in.  I had the worst hangover in my  life, so bad -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  And came in anyway?</p><p>ASMAN:  It took me about two hours to walk one block because I felt  like I was 104.  And I came in anyway.  But once I get to my desk, my head  fell down.  We used to work at \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  I used to work  to \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  I used to work there, and the editor of \"The  Wall Street Journal,\" who never came to my office, that one day he came in.</p><p>And luckily, he knew the guy that I'd been drinking with the night  before, and I said, I'm sorry, I was out with so and so, and he said, OK,  put your head back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Veronica, you have no hope of topping that story.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I really don't.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm hoping that you're not the person -- one of the most  outlandish excuses that we saw on the Career Builder survey which is, you  know, one of the reasons why we're doing this, couldn't make it to work  because his false teeth flew out the window while he was driving down the  highway.</p><p>ASMAN:  That's a good -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you think that guy was telling the truth? </p><p>ASMAN:  No.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Or do you think something else happened, and they made up  that crazy excuse?  What do you think, Veronica?</p><p>DAGHER:  He's crazy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER:  Why would you even share that even if it was true?</p><p>FRANCIS:  If it's true, why would you share it?</p><p>DAGHER:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you have to be lying.  That's my thought with something  like that, right? </p><p>DAGHER:  Yes.  I mean, I could see that.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Thirty-three percent of people who called out sick,  according to Career Builder, just didn't feel like going to work.</p><p>ASMAN:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They called and said they were sick.</p><p>ASMAN:  Actually, seriously, I did once when I was at \"The Journal,\" I  had to fire somebody because she was always using excuses.  But I don't  think they were -- this was before the days of all the surveillance devices  and everything -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  -- posting on Facebook.  I mean, they call in sick and then  they tweet or they post on Facebook -- </p><p>ASMAN:  Well, that's it.  You can prove it now.  In my day, you  couldn't necessarily prove it quite as easily.  But now, you can prove it.   Certainly, if they post anything on Facebook.  And I do know of one person  who was caught at a baseball game, and they were seen -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  According to a survey, 30 percent of employers check on  employees, either ask them for a doctor's note or they look on social media  to see if they really sick when they say -- so word to the wise out there.   The first Monday in February is the most popular day for employees to call  out sick.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  See, I think that makes total sense because you go through  the holidays and you have a great time.  You come back in January, and you  hit -- you're like, ah, we don't have a day off or anything -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, either that or it's the Super Bowl.</p><p>ASMAN:  Oh, bingo.  That's it.  Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  People call in -- but I always think -- I mean, I'm  always amazed, I do notice people calling in the day after the Super Bowl,  and I'm shocked -- </p><p>ASMAN:  By the way, you mentioned the false teeth.  My favorite one is  the guy who called in sick because he said a swarm of bees had surrounded  his car, and he couldn't get out.  Oh, my goodness!</p><p>FRANCIS:  There it is.</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, he had proof, i didn't know that.</p><p>FRANCIS:  He had proof of it, but obviously, he called someone on a  phone -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Anyway, all right.  Thanks, guys.  \"Who Made Money Today?\"   It sure is a beautiful day for him and his investors.  Not sure who it is?   We'll have the answer right after this.  You can never have too much MONEY  or too many sick excuses.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's \"Who Made  Money today.\"  Once again, everyone who owns Facebook.  Company reported  strong third quarter earnings.  Social media giant says it swung to a  profit with 60 percent revenue growth, beating the street's expectations.   Investors decided they aren't overly concerned about a big decline in daily  use by younger teens.  And Facebook stock closed up almost 2.5 percent  today.</p><p>Rock star, Bono, and his investment group, Elevation Partners, owns  about 40 million shares of Facebook.  They made a very impressive 48  million bucks today.  I would take that.  Not bad.</p><p>Also making money today, a 67 year-old man in Orlando, Florida who  just won his second multimillion-dollar lotto in two years.  The Florida  Lottery says James Boseman Jr. (ph) hit the jackpot for a three million  bucks.  Last year, he won 10 million bucks.  He bought both tickets from  the same 7/11.  Fun fact.  He didn't use the same numbers.  In case you're  wondering, the odds of a double win like that are about one in 196  trillion.</p><p>And not spending money, on the Fresno State Basketball team's opening  game, everyone who's going.  That's because Indiana Pacers all-star, Paul  George, bought every single ticket to his Alma Matters first game.  The  \"Fresno Business Journal\" reports all George purchased all 15,596 seats at  the Save Mart Center.</p><p>And season-ticket holders won't have to worry.  They'll have the same  seats for the game.  It's the NBA star's way of giving back to his former  college.  And the low estimate for what it costs him, about $265,000.   Though given that, he just signed a contract extension worth $90 million  over five years, I guess, he can afford it.</p><p>That's all we've got for you.  I hope you made MONEY today.  You've  got to watch tomorrow.  Our money talker is all about how you should really  dress for work.  What about those short skirts and too tight dresses?  How  about the CEO who says women who wear high heels have no brains?  Those are  fighting words, and we are all over it.  That is tomorrow.  \"The Willis  Report\" is coming up next.  Happy Halloween.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

It further reported that Facebook'slobbying efforts in particular were the highest 'among big internet platforms, an increase from its previous high in the same period a year earlier.' It found Google's lobbying spending 'dipped' to $3.1 million in the second quarter.As The Hill reported[2] July 23, 'The surge in spending comes as Congress and regulators are scrutinizing tech giants' market power and handling of user data.' The federal government has Facebook and Amazon under major scrutiny[3] for potential antitrust violations as well as political bias and censorship of conservatives.'The FTC and the Department of Justice are also said to be conducting a review of tech companies' use of their market power that could potentially lead to an antitrust investigation,'The Hill continued.MarketWatch noted[4] Facebook 'lobbied on issues such as data security, privacy legislation, visas for high-tech workers, artificial intelligence, tax policy and the replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.'It also reported that Amazon 'Lobbied on U.S. Postal Service reform, American tariffs, facial-recognition technology, cloud computing, music licensing, legislation affecting drones and many other matters.'Facebook is close to settling with the Federal Trade Commission over its mishandling of users' information in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Bloomberg reported that the FTC voted to fine it $5 billion and final details were expected within days.

It further reported that Facebook'slobbying efforts in particular were the highest 'among big internet platforms, an increase from its previous high in the same period a year earlier.' It found Google's lobbying spending 'dipped' to $3.1 million in the second quarter.As The Hill reported[2] July 23, 'The surge in spending comes as Congress and regulators are scrutinizing tech giants' market power and handling of user data.' The federal government has Facebook and Amazon under major scrutiny[3] for potential antitrust violations as well as political bias and censorship of conservatives.'The FTC and the Department of Justice are also said to be conducting a review of tech companies' use of their market power that could potentially lead to an antitrust investigation,'The Hill continued.MarketWatch noted[4] Facebook 'lobbied on issues such as data security, privacy legislation, visas for high-tech workers, artificial intelligence, tax policy and the replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.'It also reported that Amazon 'Lobbied on U.S. Postal Service reform, American tariffs, facial-recognition technology, cloud computing, music licensing, legislation affecting drones and many other matters.'Facebook is close to settling with the Federal Trade Commission over its mishandling of users' information in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Bloomberg reported that the FTC voted to fine it $5 billion and final details were expected within days.

View original post here[2]. Via LogicMag.io,[3]In recent years, we've been hearing more about the role of algorithms in our lives. Algorithms are helping decide whether people get a job or a loan, what news (fake or otherwise) they consume, even the length of their prison sentence. But algorithms are also rewiring the world of finance, with immensely important consequences. In an era of financialized capitalism, finance plays a powerful role in the global organization of wealth and work\u2014which means that everyone will feel the effects of the industry's transformation. We sat down with an algorithmic trader to learn more about how algorithms are remaking the industry, and why it matters. We talked about what algorithmic finance actually looks like, who the winners and losers are likely to be in the new big data gold rush, and why we may be entering an era of irrational cyborg exuberance.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2019-03-01_13-12-46.jpg?itok=6T1KMdcf\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2019-03-01_13-12-46.jpg?itok=6T1KMdcf</url> Let's start by talking about your background. How did you get involved in finance? I was always interested in economics and had a quantitative background. Anyone who succeeds academically where I grew up ends up being very quantitatively oriented. After school, as I was trying to find a profession that would be financially rewarding but would also allow me to use what I studied, I started looking at the financial industry. I ended up taking a job on a trading floor in an investment bank. Most large banks have at least one, typically several trading floors. It's an actual floor, about the size of a football field, filled with traders who do business with large investors looking to trade stocks, bonds, or futures, or to borrow money. The bank makes money by taking a commission, or by 'market-making'\u2014intermediating between buyers and sellers, taking some risk with its own money while it waits for the two sides to match up. When I think of a trading floor, I think of a bunch of guys screaming into the phone,Wolf of Wall Street-style. It's not so much people yelling into the phones anymore. The trading floor has evolved quite a bit over time. It used to be more about being alive to the transactional flow of global markets. It's increasingly about the operations that enable that flow, and the intellectual property that allows people to make money off that flow. I liked it. The trading floor is still where a lot of the actual design and transactions of global markets take place. And it's stimulating. If you want to use your intellectual muscles, you can do so pretty quickly. You're not just sitting at a desk somewhere out of the way, or trying to pitch corporate titans with some arbitrary analysis to back you up \u2014which can be more of a salesmanship game and less of an intellectual exercise. Anyway, over time I migrated to the investment strategy part of the financial world. I started helping large asset owners\u2014entities like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds\u2014allocate their money to systematic investment programs. That's where I migrated to because that's where most of the financial world was migrating to after the 2008 financial crisis, as everyone realized that the old ways of investing were not really doing what they wanted them to do. Portfolios had been too exposed to the same underlying risks. Technology was now enabling investors to understand their risks better, and to take more direct control over their investments. Part of the shift involved removing human decision-making when it wasn't perceived as adding any value. What do those new ways of investing look like? What are 'systematic investment programs,' and how do they fit into the field of algorithmic finance as a whole? There are many ways that algorithms are actually used in finance, so the term algorithmic finance gets used more loosely than it should. There are at least two major domains in which algorithms dominate. The first is what's frequently called algorithmic trading, which focuses on market microstructures. It programs computers to make split-second automated decisions on how stocks are bought and sold. Should you buy a whole bunch of shares at once? Or should you split up your purchases over time? How do you more intelligently execute trades? Algorithmic trading uses algorithms to help answer these questions\u2014and it's an enormous industry. There are a lot of hedge funds and traditional investment banks that try to make money there. The other domain, which is the one that I'm more focused on, is sometimes called systematic investing and sometimes called quantitative investing. It's also very much algorithmic investing. It involves using algorithms to allocate money systematically based on data. An early version of quantitative investing\u2014starting roughly in the 1950s, with the birth of Modern Portfolio Theory\u2014was designed to create rules to save for retirement. These rules were supposed to help people decide how much of their money to put into stocks and how much of it to put into bonds. Once you've made that decision, you have a rule that lets you allocate money across stocks and bonds at some defined frequency automatically, without a human being going in and having to make any qualitative decision. This basic framework was rapidly adopted across investment portfolios at every scale, from mutual funds for individual investors to asset allocation decisions by the largest funds in the world. Then people took that framework and applied it to an increasing number of underlying assets, with a much finer degree of granularity. So now you're not just making rules that determine the overall mix of stocks and bonds in a portfolio but which stocks, which bonds, which commodities, which corn futures, and so on. And the rules used to distribute assets become far more complex. When you say 'making rules,' what exactly are we talking about here? The simplest rules can be run on a basic spreadsheet. For instance, classic pension portfolios used to allocate 60% of the portfolio to large-cap stocks and 40% to bonds. Then Modern Portfolio Theory started to allocate assets accounting for mathematically measured risk and return. You run a giant optimization that promotes diversification\u2014across stocks within your stock portfolio, across asset classes\u2014to maximize the return you make per unit of risk. These rules didn'tneedany further human intervention, in the sense that they completely defined a portfolio. But in practice, investment wasn't completely rule-based: investors used the model outputs as a baseline, and then tweaked it with their own decisions. Human insight could further improve the asset mix, in a variety of ways. Investors might want to buy cheaper stocks, for instance, or 'time' the market by getting in or out at the right time. Or they might want to find new assets like commodities and mortgage securities, or improve the measurement of risk. More recently, however, advances in computing power and financial engineering have vastly expanded the universe of analytical tools that can be applied to investing. The latest 'rules' involve developing machine learning models that train on large amounts of data. It could be data from the financial statements of publicly traded companies. It could be macroeconomic data. It could be the price history of certain financial instruments. It could also be more esoteric data like satellite imagery. What's a concrete example of an investment decision driven by a machine learning model? You could purchase a 'sentiment' score developed by a firm that trawls Twitter on a continuous basis to understand changes in the mood of the market, or around a specific company. You could use that data to train your model, which could then determine whether to buy or sell certain shares. Usually signals like a sentiment score decay pretty quickly though, so you would want to be able to make that trade fast. How automated would that process be? Are we talking about software making recommendations to human traders, or actually executing trades itself? The level of human oversight varies. Among sophisticated quantitative investors, the process is fairly automatic. The models are being researched and refined almost constantly, but you would rarely intervene in the trading decisions of a live model. A number of hedge funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) run on auto-pilot. By contrast, most traditional investors use models to provide guidance rather than to generate automated trading decisions, since its unlikely that they could operationalize a complex trading strategy. One of the challenges with machine learning is explainability. As the model becomes more complex, it can become harder, even impossible, to explain the results that it generates. This has become a source of concern as public scrutiny of the tech industry has increased, because you have algorithms making decisions that affect people's lives in all sorts of ways while the reasoning for those decisions remains completely opaque. When the financial industry plugs a bunch of data into a model in order to make an investment decision, how important is the explainability of the result? I think the result should be very explainable. But that's not a universal view. In fact, there's a fairly big split between people who have concluded that explainability is holding back the advancement of the use of these techniques, and the people who hold on to the rather quaint notion that explainability is important. But to some extent, explainability was already an issue well before we started using machine learning, because even traditional models of investing were hampered by some of these same issues. Finance is not like physics. You have a lot of feedback loop mechanisms impacting how participants interact with financial markets. To give you a simple example, you might look at the price data of a stock and conclude that because that stock went up last month, it's a good idea to buy that stock today. And if you do that systematically, you might expect to make some money. But if everybody else comes to the same conclusion, then the stock could get overbought today based on the movement of the stock over the past month. And if it's overbought, you might actually expect to lose money on it over the next month. Looking at historical data to figure out where your investment is going to go is useless if you haven't thought about the mechanism by which it's going to do that. In the example I gave, if you didn't have an explanation forwhythe stock was moving the way it was moving, you might have missed the fact that the underlying mechanism didn't really exist, or that it wasn't robust enough to weather a whole lot of market participants looking to take advantage of that phenomenon. So explainability has been an issue for a while. Everyone is always looking for a story for why they're doing what they're doing. And many of those stories aren't that robust.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/6426f6aee9a98d936a8429c1dddc2f1b.jpg?itok=Ij5Vspwn\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/6426f6aee9a98d936a8429c1dddc2f1b.jpg?itok=Ij5Vspwn</url> But isn't there a strong financial incentive to try to understandwhyyou're doing what you're doing, whether it's an algorithm or a human executing the trades? Otherwise it seems very easy to lose a lot of money. Sure. But the market structure of investing dilutes that incentive. The people who are developing the most sophisticated quantitative techniques work for hedge funds and investment banks. For them, there are two ways to make money. You make money by charging fees on the assets you manage, and you make money on the performance of the fund. That split will give you a sense of why there's a dilution of the incentive. Because even if your assets don't perform well, you can still make money on the fees that you're charging to manage those assets. The rewards from those fees are so large that if you can sustain a story for why your technique is superior, you can manage assets for a long time and make a ton of money without having to perform well. And, to be fair, sometimes it takes a number of years before you know whether the quantitative technique you tried actually works or not. So even if you aren't making money in the short term, you could have a reasonable story for why you aren't. At the end of the day, for the manager, it's as important to gather a lot of assets as it is to run a successful strategy. And gathering assets can be largely a marketing game. And you play that marketing game by talking about your algorithms and machine learning models and artificial intelligence techniques and so on. That's right. Let's look at hedge funds in particular. Hedge funds are a very expensive form of investment management. So they need to justify why they're getting paid as much as they're getting paid. There's a large amount of data that suggests that the average hedge fund, after you've paid all the fees that they charge, is not doing much for you as an investor. The last several years in particular have not been very kind to the hedge fund industry in terms of the returns they've produced. So hedge funds have a strong incentive for differentiation in their marketing story. The first marketing question for a hedge fund is always, 'Why are you not the average hedge fund?' Investors want to knowhowa hedge fund is going to make money, given the poor performance of the hedge fund industry as a whole. These days, investors are excited by an orientation towards technology and big data and machine learning and artificial intelligence. These tools offer the promise of untapped returns, unlike older strategies that may have competed away the returns they were chasing. Regardless of whether you're actually good at technology as a hedge fund, you want to have a story for why youmight be. Some of the most prominent hedge fund managers of the last few decades\u2014Steve Cohen, Paul Tudor Jones\u2014are going against type and launching technology-driven quantitative investment funds. They employ physicists and computer scientists to write algorithms to invest money, because that's what investors want. You're seeing a massive arms race across hedge funds to rebrand themselves in that direction. It reminds me a bit of startup founders marketing themselves to Silicon Valley venture capitalists by peppering their pitch decks with buzzwords related to artificial intelligence or some other hot field. The startups might get funded, but the technology might not really work\u2014or it might not even exist. What the startup is calling artificial intelligence could be a bunch of workers in the Philippines doing manual data entry. In the financial industry, investors want firms that use big data and machine learning and artificial intelligence\u2014but do those new tools actually generate better results? That's a good question. The best way to explore it might be to talk about the role of data. There's a lot of excitement in the financial industry about the amount of new data that's being made available. Think about what kind of data might be useful for predicting the price of an oil future. It might be a piece of political news, public announcements from regulators, satellite images of oil refineries to calculate oil reserves. There are tons of different kinds of data out there\u2014pretty much anything you can think of. Along with new forms of data, there are also new forms of data analysis. The early versions of complex data analysis included looking at the financial statements of publicly traded companies. But now you can parse through the data in those statements in more interesting ways. Back in the day, you might care about how much debt the company has or what its earnings are relative to its price, and you might compare those figures to the broader market. But you were ultimately limited by your capacity to source and process this data. Now you can analyze more variables more systematically across thousands of stocks. You can also do more exotic things like use natural language processing techniques to figure out what the company is saying in its statement that isn't reflected in its numbers. How did the commentary change from previous earnings reports? What is the tone of the words they use to describe the underlying business? How does this tone compare to words used by its competitors? Even though it's the same data you had access to before, you have more processing power and better techniques to understand that data. The challenge is that not all of these sources of data and ways to analyze them will be useful for predicting the prices of financial instruments. Many of the new data sets, like satellite imagery, tend to be quite expensive. And they may not add any information more useful than what is already available to market participants from the vast streams of data on prices, companies, employees, and so on. We're still in the phase where we're trying to figure out what to do with all the data that's coming in. And one of the answers might be that most of it is simply not that valuable.The Big Data Gold Rush      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/872-CS-634.jpg?itok=rCriFo4i\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/872-CS-634.jpg?itok=rCriFo4i</url> Let's say itdoesturn out to be valuable. What does the financial industry look like then? Everyone is competing against everyone else. If one firm succeeds in making the market more efficient through quantitative techniques, then there's less money left over for other people to make exceptional investment returns. There will be one or two firms that are good at innovation and recognizing things that other people haven't recognized. But everyone else will be fighting over scraps. One of the fallacies that people have is the assumption that because the people who are working at certain firms are smart, they must be successful. But the fact that they understand artificial intelligence or machine learning or big data is somewhat useless as a competitive advantage if everyone else understands it as well. So as those techniques get diffused across the industry as a whole, they start to be less of a differentiator. How does this impact employment? How do you see these technologies affecting either how many people the financial industry employs, or the level of skill required in different roles? Back before the financial crisis, there was a theoretical basis for the rise of the mortgage-backed security industry. If you can diversify the risk to the investor by bundling a bunch of mortgages together, then the investor should be willing to accept a lower return, which in turn should reduce the cost to homebuyers of taking out a mortgage. That's the theory: when financial markets work well, the benefits should percolate throughout the economy. Obviously, in 2008, that theory broke down. In the field of quantitative investing, the same theory plays out. Let's say people are saving money for retirement by investing in a mix of stocks and bonds. Those assets are a little cheaper for them to buy because there are all kinds of participants in the market who are fighting over making the market a little more efficient because there's a financial incentive for them to do so. The flip side is that the entire financial industry also has an incentive to encourage people who don't know as much as them to give them money to do all the things that ordinary investors don't know about. 'Give me money to use a machine learning technique to manage your money, even if the machine learning technique doesn't work, because it's very profitable for me to take 2 percent of your fund every year.' So the incentive to make the market more efficient is balanced against the excessive proliferation of financial services that don't add value. What is the mechanism that's going to eliminate that? Well, it's the recognition that the industry as a whole may be getting paid far in excess of the value it's providing. How does that recognition actually begin to remake the industry, and what role will new technologies play in that process? The short answer is that tons of jobs are on the verge of getting wiped out because technology can do those jobs. And there are benefits to scale, so you may not need many firms to replace those that don't survive. Take the mutual fund industry. It has more than a hundred thousand employees in the US. And every one of those jobs is at risk from the realization that the economic value of those funds is replicable with the right computer systems. For the moment, those jobs are sustained by inertia, or they are sustained by a story about why a certain manager is going to make you more money than an index fund. But that's changing. That change will play out over the next couple of years. Take the big money managers in Boston like Fidelity and Putnam. Those are old, large institutions. Effectively all of those jobs are at risk unless they evolve fast. And even if they do, automation will cut deep. Hedge funds, same thing. Some of them will be able to eke out value from the development of new techniques, but everyone else will be replaced by computers. You're already seeing big changes at investment banks. Even though investment banks continue to be very large in terms of their physical footprint, number of employees, and impact on the economy, the actual participants inside banks have changed a fair bit. It's far more automated. Many of the actual operations inside an investment bank are done by computers. It's not humans deciding to buy Apple stock; it's computers deciding to buy Apple stock. So that job shift is already happening. Financial firms are increasingly becoming tech firms. JP Morgan Chase employs 50,000 technologists, two-thirds of which are software engineers. That's more engineers than many big tech firms: Facebook, for example, employs about 30,000 people total. You've been in the financial industry for a little while so you've seen this transformation firsthand. How has the influx of technologists changed the industry? The very clubby nature of traditional financial firms like investment banks has been diluted. You've got a lot more geeks and nerds. You don't see certain jokes being made. Football conversations have been replaced by conversations about restaurants or other staples of yuppie culture. The culture has mellowed quite a bit. It's less driven by adrenaline. It's less loud. The value is provided not by the person yelling into the phone but by the person who's sitting at their computer, writing the right algorithm, who needs a little bit of thoughtfulness to do that work. The old model was about driving transactional flow through sheer energy. The new model is about driving transactional flow through computers. So lessWolf of Wall Streetand moreThe Social Network. Totally. But that tension is still playing out. For instance, there's still a big disconnect between the way that HR divisions recruit, especially at large firms, and the kind of candidates that are actually needed. So you're seeing the development of completely alternative hiring tracks within large firms. The traditional hiring track just doesn't give you enough good quantitative candidates. Returning to the question of employment: you said you expected that one of the biggest consequences of these technologies will be a reduction in the number of people the financial industry employs. Does that also affect the overall size of the industry? On the one hand, it seems like many jobs could be eliminated or deskilled. On the other hand, it also seems possible that the very large size of the financial sector relative to the rest of the economy could be reinforced and even intensified by these technologies. I think you're right. There's a contradiction built into managing money using quantitative techniques. Let's say you're a hedge fund and you get paid a lot for an advanced technique. In order to demonstrate to your customer that your technique really does make money and does so in a replicable and sustainable fashion, you need to be a bit open-kimono in talking about why the technique works. You probably have to talk about the actual algorithm itself. But of course once you've described the algorithm, well, why does the investor need to pay a manager to do it? It's just lines of code. Once you've developed it, you can run it for the marginal cost of next to zero. Some of the managers who have been successful at raising money for their quantitative funds may have done the work of educating investors on why peopleshouldn'tbe paying that much money to invest using these techniques. The result is that fees are dropping fast. Currently, the largest growth in investment industry funds is happening in entities like BlackRock or Vanguard. These firms are launching a number of funds that use algorithms to invest but charge very low fees. So they are competing with hedge funds, who are having to lower their own fees in response. But BlackRock and Vanguard are also competing with themselves, because they are educating the market on why their own previous products were too highly priced. If you measure their scale by the number of assets under management, these entities have grown at an explosive rate. BlackRock manages trillions of dollars at this point. But the actual revenue it ekes out from its assets isn't growing nearly as fast. So you see both forces at play: the expansion of funds being managed along quantitative lines, but also the difficulty in sustaining profitability on those assets as more customers become aware of the actual cost and value of managing those assets using quantitative techniques. Even though the footprint might expand, the profitability will probably start to retreat towards levels that reflect the underlying value created. Does that create a tendency towards greater consolidation? As the revenue that firms are able to wring out of the assets they manage goes down due to the impact of quantitative techniques, there's presumably an incentive to manage more and more assets. That's certainly what we've seen. In the new world there are many benefits to scale. BlackRock can charge .01 percent to manage a fund because it's got $6 trillion behind it. A smaller firm can't compete at .01 percent. Fidelity now offers a fund that doesn't even charge a fee. And the reason they can do that is because they have incredible scale across the rest of the platform, and if you're a customer you might buy something somewhere else on the platform. So consolidation is a solution to the low marginal cost of these products. Once the algorithm is known, it's a race to see how low you can go. And how low you can go is a function of how much you manage.Irrational Cyborg ExuberanceWhat new kind of vulnerabilities are introduced into the financial system through these techniques? What role will they play in the next financial crisis? The way that mortgage-backed securities precipitated the financial crisis is very much applicable here. One of the fallacies behind that phenomenon was the assumption that the world would behave in the future the way it had in the past. For instance, housing prices would go ever upwards. That fallacy is intensified in the case of quantitative investing, because all quantitative models use historical data to train themselves. As these techniques become more widespread, the assumption that the world will behave in the future the way it has in the past is being hard-wired into the entire financial system. Another fallacy in the lead-up to the financial crisis was the assumption that financial markets were so efficient that participants didn't need to do the underlying work to figure out what the securities were actually worth. Because you could rely on the market to efficiently incorporate all available information about the bond. All you need to think about is the price that someone else is willing to buy it from you at or sell it to you at. Of course, if all participants believe that, then the price starts to become arbitrary. It starts to become detached from any analysis of what that bondrepresents. If new forms of quantitative trading rely on assumptions of market efficiency\u2014if they assume that the price of an instrument already reflects all of the information and analysis that you could possibly do\u2014then they are vulnerable to that assumption being false. Is Uber worth $60 billion? Well, Uber is worth $60 billion because we believe someone is willing to pay $60 billion for it. But maybe Uber is worth zero. Maybe that's the actual value of the revenues that Uber will make in the future. In the current environment, we rely on liquidity to sustain prices for financial assets. When liquidity dries out and you're forced to rely on the things that those financial assets actually represent, however, you could see painful shocks if there's a big disconnect between price and reality\u2014the kind of shocks you saw during the financial crisis. If people didn't want to do the analysis before, they're probably even less inclined to do it now. They figure the machine learning models are taking care of it. Right. The machines are taking care of it. Or other market participants are taking care of it. I might think that the share of a particular company is worth 20 dollars. But its price can go up to 100 dollars well before it drops down to 20, in which case I can't sustain my measure of its actual value. So if all of the computers are pushing the price to 100 dollars, I might as well not do the work of figuring out what the company is actually worth because it's somewhat irrelevant to the price that it trades at. Paraphrasing Keynes, 'Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.' It sounds like algorithms have the potential to make that irrationality worse. If the underlying computer models are less sensitive to measures of fundamental worth, they can create very large distortions in the prices of financial assets. You don't need computers to do that, of course. You can have the Fed making a lot of cash available to everyone, cash that needs to go somewhere, and assets appreciate in response. Computers can do something similar. They can assume that prices will behave the way that their models tell them they'll behave, and therefore drive prices to a point that is extremely disconnected from the things those prices are supposed to represent. On February 5, 2018, the stock market fell off a cliff. The Dow industrials dropped nearly 1600 points, its worst intraday point drop in history. In the aftermath, there was a lot of discussion about the role of computerized trading in triggering the crash. Is this a preview of the world to come? Should we expect more of that in the future? There are certainly forms of instability that have been introduced by algorithmic trading that will increase as we put more and more faith in these algorithms. The February 2018 flash crash was instructive. The culprit was a slightly esoteric exchange-traded product that has a rebalancing mechanism inside of it. And that rebalancing mechanism ended up destroying the product on one specific day when the market moved a little bit more than the product was designed to handle. The product was required to trade a lot of instruments in response to that move. But then those trades exaggerated a small move and it became a big move, which required more rebalancing\u2014and everything spiraled out of control. What about the impact of a more algorithmic financial system on retail investors? We've mostly been talking about big institutional investors, which makes sense because that's where the money is. But how do these types of tools filter down to the ordinary investor who's maybe got a small retirement fund? You've already got robo-advisors, which use algorithms to manage assets for retail investors. We're also probably only a few years away from you being able to log into a brokerage account and run a sophisticated institutional-grade algorithm yourself. People tend to assume that the diffusion of these technologies is a good thing. I'm more ambivalent. I think it could be a big mistake to have the population at large play around with algorithms. Some people who are very good at it might benefit from having access to this broadened toolset. But most people will just end up paying too much or make bad decisions because they're being given access to a technology that they aren't equipped to do anything useful with. They can lose money with it, however. Looking ahead, what else do you see on the horizon as finance becomes more algorithmic? We've talked about the extent to which large financial firms are becoming tech firms. But I expect that it'll start accelerating in the other direction: big tech firms will become financial firms. If you're a tech firm, why would you assume that a traditional financial firm is better at tech than a tech firm? If we're talking about using big data and machine learning, well, tech firms have been doing that for a while. They're better at data structure and organization and processing than anybody. They're also newer, so they probably started off with better architecture internally. In China, this is already happening. Large Chinese tech firms like Alibaba are much further along in their integration into the financial industry than their equivalents in the US. They're doing payments and deposits and loans. The regulatory structure is more permissive. Given the expected growth of financial services there, it's likely also a more attractive investment than for large tech companies in the US. Entrenched incumbents may be harder to dislodge here. What financial firms have is a large customer base, which can be sticky. They also have a lot of unique knowledge\u2014customer, economic, regulatory\u2014from their position in the economy. But Google and Facebook have a ton of information they can employ for the same purposes\u2014I mean, it's hard to compete with the sheer quantity of data that tech firms have, or the scale of their integration into people's lives. Retail investors have to put their money somewhere. They're currently putting it into traditional financial firms. But there's no reason that Google and Facebook shouldn't be accepting deposits, facilitating payments, making loans, managing assets, running quantitative investment funds. Everything I've described to you in the field of quantitative investing, I would imagine those companies could do very quickly. The data, the analysis, the algorithms, the infrastructure. The only question is why they haven't yet.

He is due to be back in court on August 12th to be arraigned. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Alex Hogan in New York for us tonight, thank you.</p><p>So as preparations continue in Milwaukee for next month's Democratic National Convention, more than 100 law enforcement agencies have informed the city, they're withdrawing from agreements to send personnel to assist with convention security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB BAUMAN, ALDERMAN, MILWAUKEE: These other police forces claiming, well, we're not going to participate unless there's adequate, what's adequate? So again, I think it's politics mostly that's being played in support of law enforcement, in general, and then Chief Morales, in particular.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: We're joined now by the police chief of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, William Lamb to respond to claims that the move is political. Chief, good to have you with us.</p><p>WILLIAM LAMB, POLICE CHIEF, FOND DU LAC, WISCONSIN: Thank you. Pleasure to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So what is your sense here? Because what we've heard from a number of these agencies is that they are worried about sending their personnel there when they're told they can't use tear gas or pepper spray or other things they may generally in the past had been able to use to control crowds. Is that the main issue as you understand it?</p><p>LAMB: Yes, that's absolutely the main issue. We had concerns leading up to this, going back into June, that there might be shortages of some of the supplies that we would need for crowd control but also that overly restrictive policies might be enacted.</p><p>And last week, the Milwaukee fire police commission validated our concerns when they issued a mandate to Chief Morales of the Milwaukee Police Department, instructing him to change department policy to discontinue the use of the chemical irritants or pepper spray in those types of situations. So that was the stepping off-point for myself and a lot of other chiefs.</p><p>BREAM: What do you say to people who look at these incursions that are happening with protesters in various cities? Now the peaceful ones, the ones who are taking the next step, inciting violence, destroying property, that kind of thing, and say that it's the use of chemical irritants and those kinds of things that provoke them. And it's not something that law enforcement officers should be using on the streets. How do you respond?</p><p>LAMB: Well, I would say that anybody who asserts that law enforcement's use of chemical irritants is what actually incites violence or destruction. Hasn't spent a lot of time studying those situations. As the lead into your broadcast tonight talked about, these are horrific, dynamic, dangerous situations.</p><p>And law enforcement does a really remarkable job of responding improperly, and using those chemical munitions or chemical irritants pepper spray, whatever you want to call them, only when they're legally justifiable, and when there are no other alternatives that might work. It's a middle ground and if you take that away...</p><p>BREAM: Yes. I mean, we know that your officers go through incredible training, very in depth on these kinds of issues, and I'm guessing it's not something they want to have to engage with protesters and with these particular kinds of weapons.</p><p>I want to play something that Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana said on this show last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I have no doubt that our local law enforcement officials could safely protect every one of us if the mayors of these cities will allow them, but they're not allowing them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So, Chief, what is the situation where you are? What do you hear from your other law enforcement peers about this? Because, listen, you know, Senator Kennedy is saying what most people think local police are completely up to protecting their own cities, that's what they train for. You're part of the community. It's what you do. Here. His assessment, though, is there are some local leaders that won't let some local police do that.</p><p>LAMB: Yes, that's the widely held consensus of law enforcement leaders across the country. Some areas seem to be better than others, some areas worse than others.</p><p>Here, unfortunately, in the state of Wisconsin, as I said, in Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission issued a mandate to Chief Morales to discontinue use of the chemical irritants.</p><p>And again, that's been the stepping off point for myself and a lot of other chiefs to say that they -- with the rules that they are -- that they have imposed, they are compromising the safety of everybody that's going to be involved.</p><p>Everybody attending the DNC, people that might be in that area, law enforcement officers, and frankly, they're setting the law enforcement officers up for failure, and that's unconscionable.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Chief Lamb, our thanks to you, your men and women who are out there on the frontlines every day. We know the vast majority of law enforcement folks in this country are good, brave, courageous people who do this, because they do want to serve their communities and we thank you for that, sir.</p><p>LAMB: Thank you for that.</p><p>BREAM: Well, the president doubling down tonight on how he feels about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're doing very well on vaccine and very well on therapeutics, so that's very important. But I happen to be a believer in hydroxy, I've used it, I had no problems. I happen to be a believer. Many, many people agree with me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Well, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel is digging through the data and he's here tonight with his diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine. Good evening, Doctor.</p><p>DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening, Shannon. As of today, the President is still sticking by hydroxychloroquine. But what is the actual science show?</p><p>Over the last several weeks, at least four major studies have come out on the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, but they have not all reached the same conclusions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>First, a study from Mount Sinai in New York looked at close to 6,500 patients in retrospect, and found that hydroxychloroquine use was associated with a lower death rate among hospitalized patients. This was published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.</p><p>Then another retrospective study from the Henry Ford Health Systems in Detroit, published in the International Journal for Infectious Diseases, looked at over 2,500 patients with an average hospitalization time of six days, and again found that there was a significant reduction in death among patients who were given hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>Just when it seemed that science might really back the drug, two new studies came out in mid-July randomized trials that sometimes drive scientific conclusions. Scientists like to call them the gold standard.</p><p>A study from Brazil examined over 500 patients with mild to moderate COVID and found that the group that received hydroxychloroquine did not fare better than those who did it. Critics still said that the drug was given too late. An average of seven days after symptom onset indeed, three other randomized controlled studies which was stopped for the drug providing no benefit were also criticized for the drug being given too late after the patient became ill.</p><p>But around the same time, a double blinded internet-based placebo- controlled study from the University of Minnesota, looking at close to 500 outpatients, fail to show a significant benefit to hydroxychloroquine use. The study had flaws relying on self-reporting and lack of diagnostic testing for all patients, but the study was definitely another nail in the drug's coffin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIEGEL: Advocates are still hopeful, but the final answer about the early and preventative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 isn't in yet. Earlier studies seemed quite promising. But the latest randomized trials have definitely been stacking against it.</p><p>More studies are ongoing. We can only hope, Shannon, that in the end, it is the science which decides. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Dr. Siegel, thank you for the recap.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, underwent a minor non-surgical procedure today at a New York City Hospital, having a revision of a bile duct stent, that was originally placed last August. 87-year-old Ginsburg, the court's oldest justice is said to be resting comfortably and expects to be released from the hospital by the end of the week.</p><p>Shark attacks and headlines coast to coast, including a rare one in Maine that was deadly.</p><p>All right, check it out. We're going to show you a drone video from a team of scientists in Southern California. Supposedly you can see there a great white shark near a surfer waiting for the waves and other sharks circling around offshore. They're also using these underwater robots to get close ups. Researchers say shark populations are going up even as more people are getting out there in the water.</p><p>Well, yet again tonight, the left warning that President Trump could deploy federal forces to prevent a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election.</p><p>Well, Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, has a lot to say about that, then he's going to join us next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): I also asked them to commit that they will not let Trump use these forces in the event he loses the election and doesn't want to leave office peacefully. I want to hear that commitment. I want to hear it in their own words. And if they won't say it, then I want to hear that silence. Because at a time like this, their silence will shout.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Massachusetts Senator, Elizabeth Warren, expressing concern that the President might deploy federal forces to prevent a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the upcoming election to Joe Biden.</p><p>What are the agencies she wants a commitment from is the Department of Homeland Security? So, let's discuss with the players at DHS, the Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan. Good to have you back on the show.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So what do you make of this? We continue to hear, over the last couple of weeks, very specific language. This is a trial run, this is going to be martial law, the President is not going to leave. How do you respond to Senator Elizabeth Warren and others who are making those claims?</p><p>MORGAN: Look, Shannon, I've been a law enforcement professional for 30 years, that's pure politics. I'm not going to get into -- it's not even worthy of a response. That's ridiculous and outrageous.</p><p>What you're seeing in Portland, it has nothing to do with those comments. We were there in Portland to absolutely address specific situations going on, and that's over 60 days of violence targeted against the federal building of the federal law enforcement officers. That's what that's about. That's just an absurd comment.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, I want to read something from Oregon governor, Kate Brown, her tweet saying this, \"After my discussions with VP Pence and others, the federal government has agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland. They've acted as an occupying force and brought violence. Starting tomorrow, all Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers will leave downtown Portland.\"</p><p>Now, there's been some back and forth on what this does doesn't mean what the agreement is or isn't. What can you tell us tonight?</p><p>MORGAN: Yes. So it's crystal clear. And the Secretary has been crystal clear about his conversations in what was agreed upon. Your listeners need to know, we're not going anywhere right now.</p><p>Look, the state police, the governor has authorized the state police to come in to work with the federal authorities that are there, shoulder by shoulder, side by side to address the ongoing violence and anarchy going on in the city streets of Portland, that's what we should be doing, that's what we've been doing for a long time.</p><p>But we're not leaving until we're absolutely sure that the threat against that courthouse and the officers inside are -- is gone. Until then, we are going to remain in Portland.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Will it be in the same fashion that it's been on the streets with the fencing around the courthouse? Is anything optically going to change? Because their argument has been that this is instigating violence, that this is upsetting the protesters, that it's inciting and accelerating the situation. So will it look different at this point?</p><p>MORGAN: You know, Shannon, first of all, the whole premise, I just get so frustrated that -- think about that. And I know the American people are buying this that the sheer presence of federal law enforcement is what's causing and justifying to try to burn down the building and seriously injure the federal agents that are there, that's outrageous and ridiculous.</p><p>But what you are going to see and it makes sense, again, something we've been asking for, as the state police come, we're not patrolling the streets of Portland, that's the local state police responsibility. They're going to come in there, they're going to have a strategy where they are going to go in the streets of Portland and do what they should.</p><p>If they do that, we can -- we can reduce our footprint and our posture, that's what we're going to do. So you're going to see a different posture at the courthouse. But again, we are going to remain in the Portland area until we think it's safe.</p><p>BREAM: It seems that there are two different groups that are getting drawn into this that don't want to be, which are -- you know, we hear from the peaceful protesters and we hear from different Black Lives Matters leaders and people there in Portland who say, you know, they've hijacked our message. We are not about this violence. We want to draw attention to the deaths of George Floyd and others.</p><p>We feel like, you know, that's getting lost in this whole thing. Then you have, you know, agents, law enforcement, state, local, federal, who are drawn into this, but people who seem intent on creating chaos and trouble. That's not part of the original message.</p><p>How are your men and women out there doing on the frontlines? I can't imagine what a difficult time it is for them, for their families to know that they're walking into this every night.</p><p>MORGAN: Shannon, that's exactly right. You just described it very well, that the tragic irony here is a very legitimate message has been hijacked by these criminals and these anarchists. You know, I've been trying to tell the protesters there, the peaceful ones, the lawful ones, hey, go block over. Get your message out, but don't be there because you're actually providing cover for these anarchists.</p><p>And I got to tell you, the men and women of law enforcement, it is tough, but they're getting up every day and they're doing the job, the job we're asking them to do to restore law and order and protect that federal building and each other. They're proud to do that, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: We're thankful. We are.</p><p>OK. One more thing. Ron Wyden, who's democratic senator there as well, he also doesn't think you're leaving, you say you're not until things change, but this is his take.</p><p>\"I'm especially concerned there's no specific timeline for full withdrawal of Bill Barr and Donald Trump's minions, his words, that's a loophole big enough to drive an armored personnel carrier through. Bottom line, this occupation should never have happened.\"</p><p>I'll give you the final word there tonight, sir.</p><p>MORGAN: I agree the -- you know, we didn't, first of all, disregard the premise of his occupation. I think you know how I feel about that. But the federal resources didn't need to go there. If two months ago, the local police and state police would have done their job to quell the violence right from the get go, that didn't happen, that's what's caused this.</p><p>And now, they're going to work together shoulder to shoulder as we should have at the beginning to absolutely address this anarchy and violence, and I think you're going to see a market difference when we do what we're supposed to as law enforcement agency, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Well, we are watching closely tonight and every night beyond until things change for the better in Portland.</p><p>Acting CBP Commissioner, Mark Morgan, always good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MORGAN: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple grilled on Capitol Hill today over accusations they're targeting conservatives. We'll debate it, next.</p><p>BREAM: Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Apple's Tim Cook defending their companies today against lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, during a big hearing on Capitol Hill.</p><p>But first, an ironic series of technical glitches threatened the testimony, but once it got started, it was deadly serious.</p><p>Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Congressman Jim Jordan got right to the heart of what Republican lawmakers have been wanting to grill these big tech execs about for two years.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Big techs out to get Conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.</p><p>TURNER: Jordan put Google's Sundar Pichai directly on the firing line.</p><p>JORDAN: Is Google going to tailor its features to help Joe Biden.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, ALPHABET: You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.</p><p>TURNER: Other lawmakers quickly lasered in on Zuckerberg.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: Thank you for the opportunity to testify.</p><p>TURNER: Who pushed back hard on accusations that Facebook has censored Republicans.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas.</p><p>TURNER: But asked about Twitter censorship of Donald Trump Jr. this week for posting a video advocating hydroxychloroquine to cure COVID-19, Zuckerberg hedged.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that, that would be a bad position for us to be in and not, not what we should be doing.</p><p>TURNER: Democrats had a different axe to grind anti-competitiveness. Chairman David Cicilline accusing all four companies of becoming so big, they're killing the tech industry.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Open markets are predicated on the idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers and business partners will choose another option. We're here today because that choice is no longer possible.</p><p>TURNER: Apple's Tim Cook made the case his company doesn't dominate the market.</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We have fierce competition at the developer side, and the customer side, which is a, which is essentially it's so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.</p><p>TURNER: Wildcard Jeff Bezos, who had never faced off against lawmakers during his 25-year reign at Amazon until today, tried to stay out of the fray but got in hot water anyway.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Did Amazon ever access and use third party seller data, when making business decisions?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private labeled business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.</p><p>TURNER: Murphy's Law was in full effect at this hearing today. It had tech problems from beginning to end with lawmakers starting about an hour late and then taking breaks so that those problems could get fixed. One source here on Capitol Hill tells us: it's about par for the course these days. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: No one is immune. All right. Jillian Turner, thank you. So, between the big tech today and the Attorney General on the hill yesterday, it's been a high-profile week of heated hearings on Capitol Hill. Democrats use the opportunity to take aim at the Attorney General.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA): He was disrespectful. Spoke over top of every one of us. In particular, he spoke over women. He was flanked by at least 10 staffers, not a person of color among them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So, let's debate the mood on Capitol Hill with Fox News Contributor Leslie Marshall, and Author of the brand-new book \"Defender in Chief\", John Yoo. Good to have you both with us.</p><p>JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon. Good to be here.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so John, regardless of which side of the aisle that you're on, if you've watched this thing yesterday and listen, it happens when different groups are in power, different parties are in power. But to continually grill the Attorney General and when he would try to answer a question and say I reclaim my time and not let him answer and then call him rude, John, it seemed like a little bit of a stretch yesterday.</p><p>YOO: I thought it was incredible. Look, I've been a staffer on the Senate, on the Judiciary Committee, and helped prepare senators and I've been a witness before congressional committees. I've never seen anything like the performance yesterday. They treated Bill Barr like he was one of the cardboard cutouts in the second rate, Major League Baseball cave we've been watching, he's just a prop.</p><p>They were making speeches, campaign commercials, essentially, and they weren't giving Attorney General Barr the chance to answer. Our congressmen and congresswomen should remember that these events are called hearings. They're called hearings for a reason; they are supposed to be hearing and listening to the American people about problems and to be seeing how the executive branches doing its job.</p><p>Instead, they did all the talking and I'm afraid, wasted a whole day of Attorney General's time when he has a lot of important things to be doing. There are serious problems, no doubt that they could be asking questions about: the riots in Portland, the intervention of federal law enforcement officers, and so on. Instead, they went ahead and scored, I thought cheap political points, rather than really trying to figure out what the problems are and what possible solutions are.</p><p>BREAM: Unless, I mean, there was plenty of coverage, and there are those on different points of the ideological spectrum who think the Democrats didn't do themselves a ton of favors yesterday with this hearing, because it did look very combative and unserious. Do you think that's a legitimate point?</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, I do. I'm a Democrat, I felt they were clearly out for blood. And, you know, look, whether it's left or right, I would agree with John in the sense that if you're going to ask a question, you need to hear, out of hearing the answer. But here's the problem further with these televised hearings, we see it on reality shows all the time.</p><p>People play for the cameras, and we see that both from Republicans, you know, and Democrats and I think sometimes they lose sight. What Democrats were accusing the Attorney General of was not being the attorney general, the lawyer for the United States, but rather being biased and being the President's, if you will, personal lawyer.</p><p>And I think there were two times he alluded to that, and they should have pushed back more and I were, personally, would have liked to have heard more answers regarding to issues of voter fraud by mail, which he had no evidence of his comments for. And in addition, for COVID-19, and some of the failings not only of the federal government, but of the various states.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and for this issue about mail-in ballots, I mean, there are a number of cases that have been, you know, flagged in recent headlines, and not least of which is the fact that in New York, not necessarily fraud, but that a bunch of ballots that are still missing weeks after the election there, the primary election there. So, I know there are questions on that point, but I want to ask you quickly both about the president tweeting this about the big tech today saying: \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with executive orders. In Washington, it's been all talk and no action for years and the people of our country are sick and tired of it.\" Before we run out of time, I want to get a quick comment from you both. John, can you do that?</p><p>YOO: Well, gosh, I think anti-trust is really boring, frankly. But I think there is a much more important, they should stick can the government regulate these very large companies, which are private companies, so they don't have to follow the free speech clause of the Constitution? Can the government intervene and force them to give free rights of speech to everyone? I'm not sure they can, and I don't know if they can do it under the guise of Anti-Trust Law.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and some will say it's become a bit of a public forum, and the government may have an interest in getting involved there.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, definitely. It's funny, John, said that, because I was going to say, look, Congress needs to rethink Anti-Trust Laws, period, whether you have these hearings or not. This is an area where you have bipartisan agreement. Additionally, I think we have not just national but international agreement when it comes to protecting our children for the child sex abuse exploitation that we see out there on the Internet.</p><p>But even more so, Shannon, right now, the American people I think, are really sick of hearings, whether it's the Attorney General, or these tech giants, because what Americans really care about is COVID, are they going to be able to feed themselves with a July 31st fast approaching. And in addition to that, you know, the, the, the racial injustice, the riots, the protest, that's what on America -- that's what's on America's minds, not Google, not Amazon, not Facebook, and not Bill Barr.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Leslie, we're going to talk about that coming up with a special guest. Thank you both very much, Leslie and John, good to see you.</p><p>YOO: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Congressman Louie Gohmert says he's going to isolate for 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19. The Republican from Texas is disputing reports that he's not been wearing a mask for most of his time on the Capitol Hill, but he says he still believes in personal freedom concerning face coverings. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was in contact with Gohmert yesterday tested negative for the virus tonight.</p><p>And in a quick COVID update from overseas, the Dutch government deciding it will not advise the public to wear masks, saying their effectiveness has not been proven through. But you can see here a walk-through Amsterdam yesterday, revealing a lot of people who are wearing masks.</p><p>So, there's an uptick in cases in Europe as well as here but Sweden for example, which never closed businesses or primary schools all the way says it's still seeing a decline in its cases.</p><p>Another show of defiance amid COVID restrictions, this time in northern Minnesota. Thousands showed up as for what's known as Minnesota's largest outdoor rodeo, packing the stands for the three-day events despite orders to limit crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel safe going anywhere and I'll, I'll do that at my own risk.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We all live this same lifestyle and we all have each other's backs. And we all are adults, we can pull up our big boy pants and know that if we're sick, we don't go out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Most of the attendees did not appear to be wearing masks.</p><p>All right, late breaking news tonight, the NBA rocked by yet another human rights scandal in China. Florida Senator Marco Rubio weighs in right here, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALMER LUCKEY, FORMER EXECUTIVE, FACEBOOK: A lot of people in Silicon Valley don't really understand this. A lot of people in Silicon Valley, a lot of companies in Silicon Valley see China as the ultimate business opportunity, not the ultimate adversary, and that is a huge problem. Think about if in World War II, if the biggest companies in the United States with the best technology had believed that Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany were better long-term business prospects in their own country. Do you think that we would have won? Would we have built the tech that we did? No, of course not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Former Facebook Executive Palmer Luckey, echoing Attorney General Bill Barr and characterizing American businesses cozying up to China, akin to being unpatriotic even dangerous. Meanwhile, tonight, the NBA's China problem is back again. According to an investigation by ESPN, the league's youth development academies in its largest international market, China, now stand accused of physical abuse and a lack of schooling for the program's young participants. Talk about all the new revelations what's going on in China and more with acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman, Republican from Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Welcome back to FOX NEWS AT NIGHT.</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so let's start with some of these NBA allegations. Former NBA coach is quoted in this investigation as saying we were basically working for the Chinese government. The investigation outlines all kinds of abuse, lack of schooling, other things regarding young players. What is the situation with the NBA with China? What do you think it shouldn't be?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's troubling. Look, the National China has a billion people. It's a massive market, basketball is very popular. And if you're the NBA, you're thinking to yourself, we have a chance to sell our product in the biggest market in the world and they see dollar figures and they're looking to expand and grow.</p><p>The problem is, this is not just any other market. This is the totalitarian government that doesn't have any of the same concepts of freedom of speech or human rights that we have in the United States, or many parts of the world, and you got to play by the rules. So, when you go to China, number one, you are a part of the Chinese government, there's no other way around it because even their companies have people on their boards and inside of their offices that are from the Communist Party.</p><p>They are all ultimate -- you're only in business in China, they allow you to be in business. And by allow you to be in business, it means you have to play by their rules and serves their purposes. And so, the NBA is in the same place as a lot of large corporations are when they go into China. They have to look the other way on some pretty atrocious actions on the part of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and the allegations that we're hearing in recent weeks. I mean, we've been hearing -- oppression of a religious minority, they're like millions of people. This is something more that we're hearing now, activist pushing for an investigation to claims that China is forcibly harvesting organs of the Uighurs.</p><p>The quote from Foxnews.com says this: \"Two Uighur activist organizations filed a complaint to the International Criminal Court against the Beijing leadership, alleging that the top brass had committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uighurs, including the stealing of organs from the mostly Muslim-Turkic ethnic group.\"</p><p>I got to say, most Americans, if they believed that that was a reality, if they knew that it was a reality, would want nothing to do with being involved American companies, American interests with China, but do we have a voice in calling out the human rights abuses by staying engaged? Should we disengage? I mean, that's a horrific allegation.</p><p>RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me just say it is a horrific allegation. I'm not here to tell you, but no one's been a bigger opponent of what they do than I do. I've heard that allegation before. I don't have evidence of it. Obviously, there is evidence of it the world deserves to know. But what we already know for sure is they are, they detain people, they put them in camps, they try to strip them of their identity, they force them to change their name, renounce their faith and religion, all sorts of terrible things, and forced labor.</p><p>They forced them to work. And we know that there are Western companies that have benefited from that. Your fundamental question is, do we disengage from China? Look, they are the second largest economy in the world, the most populous nation on Earth, they're a nuclear power, they're going to continue to grow in power and influence. We have to have a relationship with them, but it has to be a balanced relationship, meaning we can't continue to allow them to cheat, steal our jobs and, and create unfair advantages over us.</p><p>And it also has to be one that doesn't require us to abandon our fundamental print, in essence that requires us to look the other way when they do these horrible things, or when they crack down on free speech, or when they break the rules when it comes to the commitments that made on Hong Kong. The price of that balance and of engagement cannot be that we abandon our principles, our ideals, and most importantly, our national interests.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, because I don't think that there's a bigger megaphone to draw attention to that than the American megaphone. I want to ask you about something else what we have you, the negotiations going on, on the Hill about coming up together with another relief package as key elements of the current coronavirus package are set to expire. This is what Senate Minority Leader, the top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said today about Republicans in these negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They put us up against the wall we have to cliffs because they wouldn't negotiate for months. The heroes bill passed 10 weeks ago today. I've been -- we've been asking Leader McConnell to negotiate for a month and now they're up against the wall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK, so where are we tonight, Senator?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, a couple points. I mean, we have to do something for the economy writ large. We know that I don't like spending a trillion dollars or whatever it ends up being. But I think the alternative is even worse, which is structural deep damage to our economy that could take a decade or more to recover from, and millions of people losing their jobs, so we have to do something.</p><p>Passing something means you have to have a Republican Senate passed something with support from Democrats, we need 60 votes. A Democratic House passed something and a Republican president, President Trump sign it. So, it's going to have to be a product of that dirty word called compromise, but we're going to have to do something. And now, it's not going to be the Heroes Act.</p><p>I mean, that bill has all kinds of things in it that has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic. But it does have to be something that helps people that are looking for jobs and can't find one right now, help small businesses survive, help protect companies from being sued out of existence, help develop more testing capability and, and hopefully ultimately vaccine and helps with the exhort extraordinary cost of going back to school that will be associated with making those schools safe.</p><p>We have to do all of that. And we got to get it done soon. And I hope we can make some progress and stop playing this sort of political game back and forth and finger pointing, which you know has become far too common hear from my, my friends as we call them on the other side of the aisle, the Democrat.</p><p>BREAM: Well, it sounds like there are a lot of threads there potentially that everybody could agree together on and get together on. We'll watch as those deadlines are taking in. Senator Marco Rubio, thanks for your time.</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: The President vows he will never let anyone put American energy out of business, details when we return.</p><p>BREAM: The President is making an election year push to enhance U.S. energy independence. Correspondent Rich Edson joins us with more. Hey, Rich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. President Trump's swung through Texas this afternoon picking up millions for his reelection campaign, knocking his presumed opponent the former Vice President Joe Biden, and touting his administration's record on energy. The President toward the double Eagle energy oil rig in Midland. This year, lower prices have battered the oil industry and the President is campaigning on supporting the sector.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left is fighting to abolish American energy to destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs.</p><p>EDSON: In Libya, Russian-linked military contractors have seized control of two of Libya's largest oil facilities. Libya has been in a civil war for the better part of a decade. A State Department spokesperson says Libya should reject attempts to militarize the energy sector.</p><p>Two weeks ago, the Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian businessman. Officials say, they believe is behind the Russian-backed militia operating in Libya. A bipartisan congressional report is also focusing on wealthy Russians. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations says Russian oligarchs are using the art industry to evade American sanctions.</p><p>The report says intermediaries bought more than $18 million of art through shell companies linked to Russian oligarchs, the same Russians the US sanctions in 2014. The report says quote: \"The subcommittee's investigation uncovered a complex set of facts involving shell companies with hidden owners, intermediaries who mask purchasers and sellers and lacks money laundering safeguards in the U.S. art industry. Senators Rob Portman and Tom Carper say they're pushing for stronger standards to police transactions in the art industry. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Thanks, Rich. Good night from Washington.

Selon vous, innovation et r\u00e9gulation sont-elles compatibles ? FRAN\u00c7OIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU - L'innovation a toujours exist\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re financi\u00e8re et c'est une bonne chose. Cela offre des opportunit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les clients, qu'ils soient particuliers ou entreprises. Notre premier engagement c'est d'\u00eatre ouvert \u00e0 l'innovation, de l'accompagner, et m\u00eame d'en \u00eatre nous-m\u00eames partie prenante pour renforcer l'efficacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier. </p><p>Mais nous sommes aussi garants de la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et donc des contributions des innovations \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier. L'ouverture d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'autre, sont parfois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme une contradiction potentielle. Dans la dur\u00e9e, je pense que les deux convergent, car une innovation qui diminuerait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des particuliers ou des entreprises serait peu cr\u00e9dible et peu durable. Plus il y a d'innovations, plus il doit y avoir un dialogue avec le secteur priv\u00e9, que ce soit avec les fintech, les banques et les compagnies d'assurance \u00e9tablies, ou demain, avec les big tech. Nous jouons pleinement notre r\u00f4le de superviseur, mais nous superviserons demain en int\u00e9grant ces innovations, chez nous comme chez les institutions supervis\u00e9es. Comment la Banque de France se transforme-t-elle de l'int\u00e9rieur pour s'adapter \u00e0 cette nouvelle donne technologique ? Aujourd'hui, nous recrutons un certain nombre de profils - data scientists, des sp\u00e9cialistes de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de l'intelligence artificielle - que nous ne recrutions pas il y a 15 ans. Nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un Lab en juin 2017, o\u00f9 nous avons men\u00e9 une trentaine d'exp\u00e9rimentations parmi lesquelles le projet Madre [registre interbancaire d\u00e9centralis\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur la blockchain, qui permet de d\u00e9livrer instantan\u00e9ment les identifiants de cr\u00e9anciers SEPA. C'est la premi\u00e8re blockchain mise en production par une banque centrale dans le monde, ndlr]. Aujourd'hui, la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements bancaires fran\u00e7ais y sont connect\u00e9s et nous envisageons de l'\u00e9largir au fichier des implantations bancaires cette ann\u00e9e. Nos portes sont \u00e9galement ouvertes \u00e0 tous, y compris aux fintech, et nous allons organiser cette ann\u00e9e, avec l'ACPR [Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution, adoss\u00e9e \u00e0 la Banque de France, ndlr] qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un p\u00f4le fintech,\u00a0un forum o\u00f9 elles seront convi\u00e9es. Le paysage bancaire se transforme avec le d\u00e9veloppement des n\u00e9obanques, qui totalisent 3,5 millions de comptes actifs dans l'Hexagone. Selon-vous, pr\u00e9sentent-elles une menace ? Fin 2018, l'ACPR a publi\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate montrant que ces n\u00e9obanques en France repr\u00e9sentent un tiers des nouvelles ouvertures de compte. C'est tr\u00e8s significatif. L'\u00e9tude souligne \u00e9galement que leur enjeu principal r\u00e9side dans la recherche de leur \u00e9quilibre \u00e9conomique, au moins initial, ce qui s'explique notamment par les co\u00fbts d'acquisition des client\u00e8les. Ces nouveaux acteurs ne constituent pas une menace pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re d\u00e8s lors qu'ils respectent les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que les autres. Un de leurs effets est de stimuler encore davantage l'innovation les banques existantes. La quasi-totalit\u00e9 d'entre elles ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une filiale ou d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une offre enti\u00e8rement mobile. Ce mouvement a commenc\u00e9 sur le march\u00e9 des particuliers mais on le voit potentiellement se d\u00e9placer sur le terrain des entreprises, et notamment les PME [la n\u00e9obanque pour PME Qonto a lev\u00e9 104 millions d'euros en janvier dernier, ndlr]. Parmi les principaux points de sensibilit\u00e9, il y a la lutte anti-blanchiment\u00a0: en cela, l'identification des clients et la v\u00e9rification de leur existence juridique et \u00e9conomique via le KYC (pour \u00abknow your customer\u00bb en anglais) est cl\u00e9. Fin d\u00e9cembre, nous avons contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 simplifier les exigences auxquelles sont soumises les banques fran\u00e7aises pour l'entr\u00e9e en relation en ligne, mais cela doit aller dans les deux sens et il faut s'assurer que la lutte anti-blanchiment est men\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on aussi rigoureuse par l'ensemble des acteurs bancaires qui s'adressent aux clients fran\u00e7ais. Qu'en est-t-il des big tech ? Quels domaines sont les plus expos\u00e9s \u00e0 leur concurrence ? Les big tech posent les m\u00eames questions que les fintech mais avec des d\u00e9fis suppl\u00e9mentaires, qui tiennent \u00e0 leur taille. Aujourd'hui, dans les pays avanc\u00e9s elles sont relativement marginales dans le domaine financier. Mais nous pouvons au moins citer deux grands domaines, o\u00f9 les big tech peuvent devenir des concurrents assez importants pour les banques existantes : le cloud et les paiements. Pour ce dernier, un certain nombre d'offres sur le march\u00e9 [comme Apple pay, Google pay, Alipay, Wechat Pay, ndlr] se d\u00e9veloppent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sous la forme de partenariats. Mais ces entreprises peuvent \u00eatre tent\u00e9es d'avoir un r\u00f4le de leader car les barri\u00e8res \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e sont relativement faibles : il y a moins d'exigences en capital et les agr\u00e9ments sont plus faciles \u00e0 obtenir. Qui plus est, l'activit\u00e9 de paiements pr\u00e9sente deux d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s int\u00e9ressants : la collecte des donn\u00e9es et le contact client, qui est beaucoup plus fr\u00e9quent que dans une activit\u00e9 bancaire traditionnelle. Avec les activit\u00e9s de paiement, les big tech sont en interface avec le client plusieurs fois par jour tandis qu'une banque traditionnelle centr\u00e9e sur du d\u00e9p\u00f4t et du cr\u00e9dit, c'est au mieux plusieurs fois par mois\u00a0! Les big tech iront-elles un jour sur l'activit\u00e9 bancaire elle-m\u00eame ? C'est une question ouverte. Certains observateurs estiment qu'elles pourraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 demander une licence bancaire, qui est beaucoup plus exigeante en mati\u00e8re de capital et de r\u00e9glementation. Sur ce point, le partenariat entre Apple et Goldman Sachs est un cas encore assez isol\u00e9. Comment faire face aux risques sp\u00e9cifiques que posent les big tech ? Pour faire face aux challenges de taille que posent ces acteurs, la coop\u00e9ration internationale doit s'\u00e9tendre \u00e0 au moins trois champs, qui sont au c ur des mod\u00e8les big tech. Le premier champ, c'est la protection des donn\u00e9es. Le deuxi\u00e8me est celui de la concurrence, car nous savons que ces big tech dominent souvent par un effet de r\u00e9seau et de taille, qui peut aussi poser des probl\u00e8mes de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Si nous nous retrouvons avec un acteur priv\u00e9 financier dominant, cela peut repr\u00e9senter un risque syst\u00e9mique. Le troisi\u00e8me sujet, enfin, est celui de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9. Or, sur ces trois domaines, la coop\u00e9ration internationale est beaucoup moins d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e que sur la r\u00e9gulation financi\u00e8re traditionnelle. En la mati\u00e8re, il n'existe pas l'\u00e9quivalent du Conseil de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re, ni des accords de B\u00e2le. Lors de la pr\u00e9sidence fran\u00e7aise du G7, nous avons voulu mettre l'accent sur cet aspect avec le ministre de l'Economie et des Finances Bruno Le Maire, en organisant des conf\u00e9rences th\u00e9matiques. C'est un d\u00e9but mais c'est un sujet qu'il va falloir d\u00e9velopper, notamment avec les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. La pr\u00e9sentation du projet de cryptomonnaie Libra de Facebook a provoqu\u00e9 une lev\u00e9e de boucliers unanime de la part des gouvernements et des r\u00e9gulateurs. Cette initiative est-elle condamn\u00e9e ? Le principe dans la r\u00e9gulation financi\u00e8re c'est : m\u00eame activit\u00e9, m\u00eames r\u00e8gles. Or, le projet Libra soulevait notamment des questions en termes de lutte anti-blanchiment, dans la mesure o\u00f9, si l'on en comprend bien ces usages, certaines transactions pourraient \u00eatre faites de mani\u00e8re anonyme. Le livre blanc pr\u00e9sentant le projet Libra consacrait 73 pages \u00e0 la technologie, trois pages aux usages et... seulement une page au respect des r\u00e9glementations. Le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre est frappant. Autre chose serait la pr\u00e9tention de cr\u00e9er une monnaie mondiale priv\u00e9e, ce qui poserait d'\u00e9videntes questions de souverainet\u00e9. Personne ne peut s\u00e9rieusement penser qu'une monnaie priv\u00e9e puisse pr\u00e9senter les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques de bien commun qu'une monnaie garantie par des autorit\u00e9s publiques, notamment celle de reconnaissance universelle qui est difficile \u00e0 associer \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, fut-elle internationale. C'est un vrai sujet de fonctionnement d\u00e9mocratique.\u00a0Dans l'histoire, toutes les monnaies d'initiative purement priv\u00e9e se sont, pour rappel, toujours mal termin\u00e9es. Fin 2019 plus de 80% des banques centrales dans le monde \u00e9tudiaient la cr\u00e9ation d'une monnaie digitale de banque centrale, contre 70% en 2018. Cette forte mobilisation est-elle une r\u00e9ponse au projet Libra ? Si le projet Libra sert d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur, c'est d'abord sur le secteur des paiements transfrontaliers. Car parmi ses finalit\u00e9s, il y avait l'id\u00e9e qu'elle puisse servir d'outil pour les \u00ab\u00a0remittances\u00a0\u00bb [transferts d'argent internationaux des migrants ou diasporas, ndlr]. Actuellement, ces transferts sont trop chers et trop longs. Y apporter une r\u00e9ponse efficace est une des priorit\u00e9s de la pr\u00e9sidence actuelle du G20 et du Conseil pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Le sujet est complexe, technique et touche aussi \u00e0 la lutte anti-blanchiment. Pourquoi alors la grande majorit\u00e9 des banques centrales planchent-elles sur une monnaie digitale ? Quelles pourraient en \u00eatre les applications ? Ces r\u00e9flexions pr\u00e9existaient au projet Libra et aucune banque centrale n'\u00e9met de monnaie digitale pour le moment. Deux applications sont th\u00e9oriquement possibles. La premi\u00e8re serait destin\u00e9e aux particuliers comme en Su\u00e8de. C'est un pays qui voit d\u00e9cro\u00eetre extr\u00eamement vite l'usage des esp\u00e8ces, billets et pi\u00e8ces, mais qui souhaite continuer \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 ses citoyens l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette monnaie \u00e9mise par la banque centrale. Lorsque vous payez avec un billet en euros, vous avez en face de vous la garantie et la solidit\u00e9 du bilan de la Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne et de la Banque de France. A premi\u00e8re vue, ce n'est qu'une diff\u00e9rence mineure, mais lors des crises financi\u00e8res, notamment en Gr\u00e8ce en 2015, on a vu des particuliers faire cet arbitrage et vider leur compte bancaire pour retirer de la monnaie banque centrale sous forme de billets. On pourrait imaginer que cette monnaie de banque centrale prenne un jour une forme digitale ; elle pourrait \u00eatre distribu\u00e9e via les banques. Une seconde application, qui pourrait venir plus vite, serait celle de la monnaie digitale de banque centrale \u00ab\u00a0de gros\u00a0\u00bb, car r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux transactions entre les institutions financi\u00e8res et avec les banques centrales elles-m\u00eames. Une banque commerciale am\u00e9ricaine, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 nou\u00e9 des accords avec un certain nombre d'institutions financi\u00e8res pour effectuer des r\u00e8glements avec un moyen de paiement digital, \u00e9mis sur sa propre blockchain. [JP Morgan exp\u00e9rimente le JPM Coin, un jeton (token) digital dont la valeur est index\u00e9e sur le dollar pour des paiements entre acteurs institutionnels, ndlr]. Cette approche semble pr\u00e9senter deux avantages : gr\u00e2ce au token vous pouvez, sur le plan technologique, embarquer une s\u00e9rie d'informations que vous n'avez pas dans les syst\u00e8mes de paiement traditionnels. Le second avantage, c'est la possibilit\u00e9 de passer dans une logique d'instantan\u00e9it\u00e9 avec un syst\u00e8me fonctionnant 24h/24 7j/7. Les banques centrales pourraient offrir un service de ce type dans leur propre actif de r\u00e8glement\u00a0: la monnaie de banque centrale qui est sans risque. C'est une question qui peut arriver plus vite. La Banque de France s'appr\u00eate \u00e0 mener ses propres exp\u00e9rimentations. De quelle nature seront-elles ? Un e-euro \u00e0 destination du grand public verra-t-il le jour ? Toute d\u00e9cision \u00e9ventuelle sur un e-euro rel\u00e8ve d'une discussion dans l'Eurosysteme, et prendra du temps. Les premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9rimentations que nous comptons lancer y contribueront, et viseront en priorit\u00e9 cette application de gros. Nous lancerons notre appel \u00e0 projets au mois de mars. A priori, la technologie sous-jacente sera la blockchain, avec les questions qui y sont associ\u00e9es, notamment celle du passage \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle et la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 supporter des transactions de grands volumes. L'\u00e9tude d'une monnaie digitale \u00e0 destination du grand public n'est pour autant pas exclue. En France, plus de 60% des transactions se font encore en esp\u00e8ces et il est extr\u00eamement important d'assurer la libert\u00e9 du choix du moyen de paiement. Je ne ferai jamais partie de ceux qui opposeront la monnaie digitale aux esp\u00e8ces. Il faut ouvrir le spectre et \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 innover, mais garantir la libert\u00e9 du choix de la m\u00e9thode de paiement est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de confiance dans la monnaie. Si un jour il y avait un sentiment de diminution d'acc\u00e8s aux esp\u00e8ces, je pense que nous verrions en France un recul de la confiance dans l'euro. Aujourd'hui, en France, nous observons une \u00e9rosion de l'usage des esp\u00e8ces. Mais nous sommes l\u00e0 pour garantir l'\u00e9gale s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l'\u00e9gale disponibilit\u00e9 des moyens de paiement. C'est le c ur de notre mission de banque centrale. L'intelligence artificielle a la capacit\u00e9 de modifier le secteur de la finance en profondeur. De quelle mani\u00e8re ? On estime que 50% des projets d'investissements des grandes banques fran\u00e7aises en IT comportent d\u00e9j\u00e0 aujourd'hui une forte composante d'intelligence artificielle. Vous pouvez voir au moins deux usages. Le premier concerne l'interface client, comme les chatbot et les robo-advisors en banque priv\u00e9e, mais beaucoup plus largement sur le KYC, et la reconnaissance faciale.\u00a0Le deuxi\u00e8me sujet, qui importe encore plus pour nous, c'est la gestion des risques. Les banques vont d\u00e9velopper de plus en plus d'algorithmes bas\u00e9s sur l'IA, \u00e0 la fois pour des scores de risques et des scores commerciaux. Quel regard portez-vous sur l'utilisation de l'IA en tant que superviseur ? Nous allons avoir deux exigences. La premi\u00e8re c'est que les institutions financi\u00e8res comprennent demain leurs algorithmes. Si c'est une bo\u00eete noire et que les r\u00e9sultats sont pris les yeux ferm\u00e9s, nous le refuserons. La deuxi\u00e8me exigence concerne la gouvernance interne. La notion de ma\u00eetrise des risques est au c ur de l'entreprise, c'est pour cela que nous insistons toujours sur l'autonomie de la fili\u00e8re risque et son rattachement \u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Nous n'accepterions pas qu'un dirigeant de banque ou de compagnie d'assurance indique que la gestion des risques rel\u00e8ve d'un algorithme g\u00e9r\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement IT. \u00c0 la fin, la d\u00e9cision doit revenir au comit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9dit. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, nous n'homologuerons pas des algorithmes \u00ab\u00a0bo\u00eete noire\u00a0\u00bb ou qui pr\u00e9tendent faire un transfert de responsabilit\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la gouvernance normale de l'entreprise.

Selon vous, innovation et r\u00e9gulation sont-elles compatibles ? FRAN\u00c7OIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU - L'innovation a toujours exist\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re financi\u00e8re et c'est une bonne chose. Cela offre des opportunit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les clients, qu'ils soient particuliers ou entreprises. Notre premier engagement c'est d'\u00eatre ouvert \u00e0 l'innovation, de l'accompagner, et m\u00eame d'en \u00eatre nous-m\u00eames partie prenante pour renforcer l'efficacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier. </p><p>Mais nous sommes aussi garants de la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et donc des contributions des innovations \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me financier. L'ouverture d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'autre, sont parfois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme une contradiction potentielle. Dans la dur\u00e9e, je pense que les deux convergent, car une innovation qui diminuerait la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des particuliers ou des entreprises serait peu cr\u00e9dible et peu durable. Plus il y a d'innovations, plus il doit y avoir un dialogue avec le secteur priv\u00e9, que ce soit avec les fintech, les banques et les compagnies d'assurance \u00e9tablies, ou demain, avec les big tech. Nous jouons pleinement notre r\u00f4le de superviseur, mais nous superviserons demain en int\u00e9grant ces innovations, chez nous comme chez les institutions supervis\u00e9es. Comment la Banque de France se transforme-t-elle de l'int\u00e9rieur pour s'adapter \u00e0 cette nouvelle donne technologique ? Aujourd'hui, nous recrutons un certain nombre de profils - data scientists, des sp\u00e9cialistes de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de l'intelligence artificielle - que nous ne recrutions pas il y a 15 ans. Nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un Lab en juin 2017, o\u00f9 nous avons men\u00e9 une trentaine d'exp\u00e9rimentations parmi lesquelles le projet Madre [registre interbancaire d\u00e9centralis\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur la blockchain, qui permet de d\u00e9livrer instantan\u00e9ment les identifiants de cr\u00e9anciers SEPA. C'est la premi\u00e8re blockchain mise en production par une banque centrale dans le monde, ndlr]. Aujourd'hui, la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements bancaires fran\u00e7ais y sont connect\u00e9s et nous envisageons de l'\u00e9largir au fichier des implantations bancaires cette ann\u00e9e. Nos portes sont \u00e9galement ouvertes \u00e0 tous, y compris aux fintech, et nous allons organiser cette ann\u00e9e, avec l'ACPR [Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution, adoss\u00e9e \u00e0 la Banque de France, ndlr] qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un p\u00f4le fintech,\u00a0un forum o\u00f9 elles seront convi\u00e9es. Le paysage bancaire se transforme avec le d\u00e9veloppement des n\u00e9obanques, qui totalisent 3,5 millions de comptes actifs dans l'Hexagone. Selon-vous, pr\u00e9sentent-elles une menace ? Fin 2018, l'ACPR a publi\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate montrant que ces n\u00e9obanques en France repr\u00e9sentent un tiers des nouvelles ouvertures de compte. C'est tr\u00e8s significatif. L'\u00e9tude souligne \u00e9galement que leur enjeu principal r\u00e9side dans la recherche de leur \u00e9quilibre \u00e9conomique, au moins initial, ce qui s'explique notamment par les co\u00fbts d'acquisition des client\u00e8les. Ces nouveaux acteurs ne constituent pas une menace pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re d\u00e8s lors qu'ils respectent les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que les autres. Un de leurs effets est de stimuler encore davantage l'innovation les banques existantes. La quasi-totalit\u00e9 d'entre elles ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une filiale ou d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une offre enti\u00e8rement mobile. Ce mouvement a commenc\u00e9 sur le march\u00e9 des particuliers mais on le voit potentiellement se d\u00e9placer sur le terrain des entreprises, et notamment les PME [la n\u00e9obanque pour PME Qonto a lev\u00e9 104 millions d'euros en janvier dernier, ndlr]. Parmi les principaux points de sensibilit\u00e9, il y a la lutte anti-blanchiment\u00a0: en cela, l'identification des clients et la v\u00e9rification de leur existence juridique et \u00e9conomique via le KYC (pour \u00abknow your customer\u00bb en anglais) est cl\u00e9. Fin d\u00e9cembre, nous avons contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 simplifier les exigences auxquelles sont soumises les banques fran\u00e7aises pour l'entr\u00e9e en relation en ligne, mais cela doit aller dans les deux sens et il faut s'assurer que la lutte anti-blanchiment est men\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on aussi rigoureuse par l'ensemble des acteurs bancaires qui s'adressent aux clients fran\u00e7ais. Qu'en est-t-il des big tech ? Quels domaines sont les plus expos\u00e9s \u00e0 leur concurrence ? Les big tech posent les m\u00eames questions que les fintech mais avec des d\u00e9fis suppl\u00e9mentaires, qui tiennent \u00e0 leur taille. Aujourd'hui, dans les pays avanc\u00e9s elles sont relativement marginales dans le domaine financier. Mais nous pouvons au moins citer deux grands domaines, o\u00f9 les big tech peuvent devenir des concurrents assez importants pour les banques existantes : le cloud et les paiements. Pour ce dernier, un certain nombre d'offres sur le march\u00e9 [comme Apple pay, Google pay, Alipay, Wechat Pay, ndlr] se d\u00e9veloppent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sous la forme de partenariats. Mais ces entreprises peuvent \u00eatre tent\u00e9es d'avoir un r\u00f4le de leader car les barri\u00e8res \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e sont relativement faibles : il y a moins d'exigences en capital et les agr\u00e9ments sont plus faciles \u00e0 obtenir. Qui plus est, l'activit\u00e9 de paiements pr\u00e9sente deux d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s int\u00e9ressants : la collecte des donn\u00e9es et le contact client, qui est beaucoup plus fr\u00e9quent que dans une activit\u00e9 bancaire traditionnelle. Avec les activit\u00e9s de paiement, les big tech sont en interface avec le client plusieurs fois par jour tandis qu'une banque traditionnelle centr\u00e9e sur du d\u00e9p\u00f4t et du cr\u00e9dit, c'est au mieux plusieurs fois par mois\u00a0! Les big tech iront-elles un jour sur l'activit\u00e9 bancaire elle-m\u00eame ? C'est une question ouverte. Certains observateurs estiment qu'elles pourraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 demander une licence bancaire, qui est beaucoup plus exigeante en mati\u00e8re de capital et de r\u00e9glementation. Sur ce point, le partenariat entre Apple et Goldman Sachs est un cas encore assez isol\u00e9. Comment faire face aux risques sp\u00e9cifiques que posent les big tech ? Pour faire face aux challenges de taille que posent ces acteurs, la coop\u00e9ration internationale doit s'\u00e9tendre \u00e0 au moins trois champs, qui sont au c ur des mod\u00e8les big tech. Le premier champ, c'est la protection des donn\u00e9es. Le deuxi\u00e8me est celui de la concurrence, car nous savons que ces big tech dominent souvent par un effet de r\u00e9seau et de taille, qui peut aussi poser des probl\u00e8mes de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Si nous nous retrouvons avec un acteur priv\u00e9 financier dominant, cela peut repr\u00e9senter un risque syst\u00e9mique. Le troisi\u00e8me sujet, enfin, est celui de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9. Or, sur ces trois domaines, la coop\u00e9ration internationale est beaucoup moins d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e que sur la r\u00e9gulation financi\u00e8re traditionnelle. En la mati\u00e8re, il n'existe pas l'\u00e9quivalent du Conseil de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re, ni des accords de B\u00e2le. Lors de la pr\u00e9sidence fran\u00e7aise du G7, nous avons voulu mettre l'accent sur cet aspect avec le ministre de l'Economie et des Finances Bruno Le Maire, en organisant des conf\u00e9rences th\u00e9matiques. C'est un d\u00e9but mais c'est un sujet qu'il va falloir d\u00e9velopper, notamment avec les autorit\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. La pr\u00e9sentation du projet de cryptomonnaie Libra de Facebook a provoqu\u00e9 une lev\u00e9e de boucliers unanime de la part des gouvernements et des r\u00e9gulateurs. Cette initiative est-elle condamn\u00e9e ? Le principe dans la r\u00e9gulation financi\u00e8re c'est : m\u00eame activit\u00e9, m\u00eames r\u00e8gles. Or, le projet Libra soulevait notamment des questions en termes de lutte anti-blanchiment, dans la mesure o\u00f9, si l'on en comprend bien ces usages, certaines transactions pourraient \u00eatre faites de mani\u00e8re anonyme. Le livre blanc pr\u00e9sentant le projet Libra consacrait 73 pages \u00e0 la technologie, trois pages aux usages et... seulement une page au respect des r\u00e9glementations. Le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre est frappant. Autre chose serait la pr\u00e9tention de cr\u00e9er une monnaie mondiale priv\u00e9e, ce qui poserait d'\u00e9videntes questions de souverainet\u00e9. Personne ne peut s\u00e9rieusement penser qu'une monnaie priv\u00e9e puisse pr\u00e9senter les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques de bien commun qu'une monnaie garantie par des autorit\u00e9s publiques, notamment celle de reconnaissance universelle qui est difficile \u00e0 associer \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, fut-elle internationale. C'est un vrai sujet de fonctionnement d\u00e9mocratique.\u00a0Dans l'histoire, toutes les monnaies d'initiative purement priv\u00e9e se sont, pour rappel, toujours mal termin\u00e9es. Fin 2019 plus de 80% des banques centrales dans le monde \u00e9tudiaient la cr\u00e9ation d'une monnaie digitale de banque centrale, contre 70% en 2018. Cette forte mobilisation est-elle une r\u00e9ponse au projet Libra ? Si le projet Libra sert d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur, c'est d'abord sur le secteur des paiements transfrontaliers. Car parmi ses finalit\u00e9s, il y avait l'id\u00e9e qu'elle puisse servir d'outil pour les \u00ab\u00a0remittances\u00a0\u00bb [transferts d'argent internationaux des migrants ou diasporas, ndlr]. Actuellement, ces transferts sont trop chers et trop longs. Y apporter une r\u00e9ponse efficace est une des priorit\u00e9s de la pr\u00e9sidence actuelle du G20 et du Conseil pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Le sujet est complexe, technique et touche aussi \u00e0 la lutte anti-blanchiment. Pourquoi alors la grande majorit\u00e9 des banques centrales planchent-elles sur une monnaie digitale ? Quelles pourraient en \u00eatre les applications ? Ces r\u00e9flexions pr\u00e9existaient au projet Libra et aucune banque centrale n'\u00e9met de monnaie digitale pour le moment. Deux applications sont th\u00e9oriquement possibles. La premi\u00e8re serait destin\u00e9e aux particuliers comme en Su\u00e8de. C'est un pays qui voit d\u00e9cro\u00eetre extr\u00eamement vite l'usage des esp\u00e8ces, billets et pi\u00e8ces, mais qui souhaite continuer \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 ses citoyens l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette monnaie \u00e9mise par la banque centrale. Lorsque vous payez avec un billet en euros, vous avez en face de vous la garantie et la solidit\u00e9 du bilan de la Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne et de la Banque de France. A premi\u00e8re vue, ce n'est qu'une diff\u00e9rence mineure, mais lors des crises financi\u00e8res, notamment en Gr\u00e8ce en 2015, on a vu des particuliers faire cet arbitrage et vider leur compte bancaire pour retirer de la monnaie banque centrale sous forme de billets. On pourrait imaginer que cette monnaie de banque centrale prenne un jour une forme digitale ; elle pourrait \u00eatre distribu\u00e9e via les banques. Une seconde application, qui pourrait venir plus vite, serait celle de la monnaie digitale de banque centrale \u00ab\u00a0de gros\u00a0\u00bb, car r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux transactions entre les institutions financi\u00e8res et avec les banques centrales elles-m\u00eames. Une banque commerciale am\u00e9ricaine, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 nou\u00e9 des accords avec un certain nombre d'institutions financi\u00e8res pour effectuer des r\u00e8glements avec un moyen de paiement digital, \u00e9mis sur sa propre blockchain. [JP Morgan exp\u00e9rimente le JPM Coin, un jeton (token) digital dont la valeur est index\u00e9e sur le dollar pour des paiements entre acteurs institutionnels, ndlr]. Cette approche semble pr\u00e9senter deux avantages : gr\u00e2ce au token vous pouvez, sur le plan technologique, embarquer une s\u00e9rie d'informations que vous n'avez pas dans les syst\u00e8mes de paiement traditionnels. Le second avantage, c'est la possibilit\u00e9 de passer dans une logique d'instantan\u00e9it\u00e9 avec un syst\u00e8me fonctionnant 24h/24 7j/7. Les banques centrales pourraient offrir un service de ce type dans leur propre actif de r\u00e8glement\u00a0: la monnaie de banque centrale qui est sans risque. C'est une question qui peut arriver plus vite. La Banque de France s'appr\u00eate \u00e0 mener ses propres exp\u00e9rimentations. De quelle nature seront-elles ? Un e-euro \u00e0 destination du grand public verra-t-il le jour ? Toute d\u00e9cision \u00e9ventuelle sur un e-euro rel\u00e8ve d'une discussion dans l'Eurosysteme, et prendra du temps. Les premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9rimentations que nous comptons lancer y contribueront, et viseront en priorit\u00e9 cette application de gros. Nous lancerons notre appel \u00e0 projets au mois de mars. A priori, la technologie sous-jacente sera la blockchain, avec les questions qui y sont associ\u00e9es, notamment celle du passage \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle et la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 supporter des transactions de grands volumes. L'\u00e9tude d'une monnaie digitale \u00e0 destination du grand public n'est pour autant pas exclue. En France, plus de 60% des transactions se font encore en esp\u00e8ces et il est extr\u00eamement important d'assurer la libert\u00e9 du choix du moyen de paiement. Je ne ferai jamais partie de ceux qui opposeront la monnaie digitale aux esp\u00e8ces. Il faut ouvrir le spectre et \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 innover, mais garantir la libert\u00e9 du choix de la m\u00e9thode de paiement est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de confiance dans la monnaie. Si un jour il y avait un sentiment de diminution d'acc\u00e8s aux esp\u00e8ces, je pense que nous verrions en France un recul de la confiance dans l'euro. Aujourd'hui, en France, nous observons une \u00e9rosion de l'usage des esp\u00e8ces. Mais nous sommes l\u00e0 pour garantir l'\u00e9gale s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l'\u00e9gale disponibilit\u00e9 des moyens de paiement. C'est le c ur de notre mission de banque centrale. L'intelligence artificielle a la capacit\u00e9 de modifier le secteur de la finance en profondeur. De quelle mani\u00e8re ? On estime que 50% des projets d'investissements des grandes banques fran\u00e7aises en IT comportent d\u00e9j\u00e0 aujourd'hui une forte composante d'intelligence artificielle. Vous pouvez voir au moins deux usages. Le premier concerne l'interface client, comme les chatbot et les robo-advisors en banque priv\u00e9e, mais beaucoup plus largement sur le KYC, et la reconnaissance faciale.\u00a0Le deuxi\u00e8me sujet, qui importe encore plus pour nous, c'est la gestion des risques. Les banques vont d\u00e9velopper de plus en plus d'algorithmes bas\u00e9s sur l'IA, \u00e0 la fois pour des scores de risques et des scores commerciaux. Quel regard portez-vous sur l'utilisation de l'IA en tant que superviseur ? Nous allons avoir deux exigences. La premi\u00e8re c'est que les institutions financi\u00e8res comprennent demain leurs algorithmes. Si c'est une bo\u00eete noire et que les r\u00e9sultats sont pris les yeux ferm\u00e9s, nous le refuserons. La deuxi\u00e8me exigence concerne la gouvernance interne. La notion de ma\u00eetrise des risques est au c ur de l'entreprise, c'est pour cela que nous insistons toujours sur l'autonomie de la fili\u00e8re risque et son rattachement \u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Nous n'accepterions pas qu'un dirigeant de banque ou de compagnie d'assurance indique que la gestion des risques rel\u00e8ve d'un algorithme g\u00e9r\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement IT. \u00c0 la fin, la d\u00e9cision doit revenir au comit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9dit. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, nous n'homologuerons pas des algorithmes \u00ab\u00a0bo\u00eete noire\u00a0\u00bb ou qui pr\u00e9tendent faire un transfert de responsabilit\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la gouvernance normale de l'entreprise.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> () --  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Monopolies are an important issue in the 2020 presidential campaign and even took the center stage at the first of last week's Democratic debates, with Elizabeth Warren pronouncing early on that she wanted to return government to the people. </p><p>This was a break from past presidential debates, to say the least. Author and editor David Dayen tweeted, \"Literally more monopoly discussion in the first 5 minutes of this debate than the past 50 years of presidential politics.\"</p><p>People tend to think of Big Tech as the antitrust issue of the day, but tech giants are only the tip of the iceberg of the monopoly problems plaguing America. Most of the major challenges the candidates discussed --- including unaffordable health care, income inequality and stagnant wages --- can't be solved without checking monopolies' economic and political power. </p><p>Take health care. The Open Markets Institute, where I work, recently published Volume II of America's Concentration Crisis, presenting troubling data on health care market concentration. In one example, two corporations, Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita, control a 92% market share in dialysis centers, a $24.4 billion industry. This concentration is a major reason health care costs have been skyrocketing for Americans. When health care providers lack competition, they can name their price and patients ultimately foot the bill. Even people with insurance through their employers pay higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs. </p><p>Yet health care is still only the beginning. The concentration crisis extends throughout our economy to include markets like baby formula, where three companies control 80% of the market, washer and dryer manufacturing, where three companies control 100% of the market, and airlines, where four companies control 76% of the market overall, with even higher concentrations on individual routes. </p><p>As monopolies and oligopolies rule most sectors of the economy, they are extracting wealth from everyone else. Chicken monopolies are extracting wealth from chicken farmers. Hospital mergers are depressing nurse's wages. Small and big businesses, workers and creators are being squeezed by monopolists who use their market power to extract the fruits of everyone else's labor. It's no surprise we are experiencing economic inequality that amounts to a New Gilded Age, with the richest 0.1% of all American families owning as much wealth as the lower 90% of all American families combined. </p><p>Monopolies are destroying the American Dream.</p><p>Market concentration causes wages to stagnate because it reduces competition for labor. Companies can pay their employees less without having to worry about losing them to competitors. One study found a 17% decline in wages when a labor market goes from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in concentration.</p><p>Lower wages, higher prices and the squeezing of suppliers and creators amounts to billions of dollars in wealth transfer to companies with market power. C-suite executives and corporate shareholders are the ones who win when monopolies and oligopolies reign, meaning that the top 0.1% capture the bulk of monopoly rents. </p><p>Warren, who has made antitrust a cornerstone of her campaign, understands the widespread harms of an economy that lacks competition. \"There is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country,\" she said in the debate. \"That hurts workers. It hurts small business. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall. And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.\" </p><p>Warren has advanced a plan for combating monopoly power in Big Tech that includes breaking up tech platforms, like Google, Facebook and Amazon, and requiring them to meet a standard of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory dealing with users and unwinding the companies' anti-competitive mergers. She also has a plan for tackling the growing consolidation among big agribusinesses and \"un-rigging\" the rules that work against farmers. </p><p>Other candidates have advanced their own proposals to tackle growing monopoly powers in the United States. </p><p>Cory Booker last year introduced a bill to put a moratorium on agriculture mergers, and said during the debate that he would appoint judges that will enforce antitrust law and \"have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.\" </p><p>Amy Klobuchar proposed changing legal standards to make it easier to challenge mergers and regulation of Big Tech through stronger privacy rules and political ad transparency.</p><p>Bernie Sanders has proposed a series of reforms that aim to level the playing field for farmers and farmworkers that include a similar moratorium on agricultural mergers, as well as the breaking up of agribusiness. </p><p>All of these proposals are steps in the right direction. Both stronger antitrust enforcement and sector-by-sector anti-monopoly policies are needed. Although weakening monopolies' grip on America will not solve all our problems, we will not be able to solve our problems without doing so. </p><p>Even the horrific abuses at the border are inseparable from the problem of our rigged economy. Widespread inequality has made so many Americans powerless that they rebuke America's historic role as a haven for the powerless. The politics of hate have made immigrants the scapegoats for Americans' powerlessness, while providing cover for the already powerful to amass even more power.</p><p>\"For all the American citizens out there who feel you are falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn't do that to you,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during the debate. \"The big corporations did that to you.\" </p><p>Certainly, the problem of corporate power having undue influence on our democracy is not a new one. But monopolies and oligopolies are like corporate power on steroids.

Many goods and services were cheaper here than in Europe. Twenty years later, American free markets are becoming a myth. Internet service, cellphone plans, and plane tickets are now cheaper in Europe and Asia than in the US. In 2018, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.atlasandboots.com/remote-jobs/countries-with-the-cheapest-internet-world/\">average monthly cost</url> of a broadband internet connection was $31 in France, $39 in the UK and $68 in the US. American households also spend       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.atlasandboots.com/remote-jobs/countries-with-the-cheapest-internet-world/\">twice as much</url> on cellphone services as households in France or the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a result of policy choices. In 1999, the US had free and competitive markets while European markets were dominated by oligopolies. The airline industry is a prime example. Over the past two decades a wave of mergers has turned the US airline industry into an oligopoly while Europe has opened its skies to competition, thanks in part to low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet. US regulators allowed these mergers to happen without meaningful challenges. EU regulators, on the other hand, encouraged the entry of low-cost competitors by making sure they could get access to takeoff and landing slots.</p><p>There are many layers of irony in this historic reversal. One irony is that the free market ideas and business models that benefit European consumers today were inspired by US markets. Another irony is that some leftwing US politicians are now contemplating policies that most Europeans would find extreme. We do not think private health insurance companies should be abolished. We favor wealth taxes, but we do not think they are a cure for all ills.</p><p>The polarization of the political debate is partly the result of ignorance. The American left sees Europe as an El Dorado of free healthcare, free education and workers' rights. The American right sees it as a socialistic nightmare with no growth and no innovation. They're both wrong, and the result is misguided policies and time wasted tilting at windmills.</p><p>But we are also witnessing a justified backlash against the corruption of American free markets. A powerful system of lobbying and campaign finance contributions is largely responsible for the growing monopolization of the US economy.</p><p>Implementing a pro-competition policy in America will be no easy task. Incumbent companies maintain their power with an array of unfair tactics to exclude rivals - acquisitions of nascent competitors, heavy lobbying of regulators, and lavish expenditures on campaign donations. To be successful in today's economy, a pro-competition policy would need to tackle the new monopolies as well as the old ones - the Googles and Facebooks and the pharmaceutical and telecom companies alike.</p><p>The payoffs would be large, however. Based on my research, I estimate that monopolies cost the median American household about $300 a month. Taking into account all the other inefficiencies monopolies entail, I estimate that the lack of competition deprives American workers of about $1.25tn of labor income every year. No wonder, then, that American workers are angry.</p><p>There is also another ironic lesson for Europe. The quality of existing European institutions is partly due to the beneficial influence of the UK. Historically France and Germany did not have a tradition of strong and independent regulators able to stand up to lobbyists and resist short term political pressures. The European Central Bank and the EU Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp) have demonstrated that they can. These institutions, while imperfect, are a public good that benefits all European citizens.</p><p>Brexit will have a significant impact on competition policy in Europe. When the UK leaves, the EU will need to keep its free market spirit alive. The UK, on the other hand, risks losing the competitive benefits of the single market. Many commentators view it only as a loss of market access, but this is just part of the story. Equally important, in my opinion, are the benefits of unfettered competition in protecting consumers, keeping domestic monopolies in check, and forcing regulators to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>The final irony is that US policymakers are now looking to Europe for clues about modern market regulations. The same pundits who made fun of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) two years ago are now thinking about the best way to create its US equivalent and offer much-needed privacy protection to US consumers. Europe's antitrust actions against big tech are no longer derided but carefully studied instead.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Thomas Philippon is the Max L Heine Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

And Senator Elizabeth Warrenhas a plan for that[1], as you might have heard. The presidential candidate has long been one of the few public officials to address the growing dominance of monopolies, and she's highlighted the problem\u2014and how to fix it\u2014on the campaign trail. (She's even placedbillboards demanding the breakup of Big Tech[2]in Silicon Valley's backyard.) I had a chance to talk with Warren between Senate votes in Washington. </p><p>We discussed how she talks about monopolies to the public, what Congress can do with its authority, and building an antitrust movement.David Dayen: We're doing this issue about economic concentration. And one thing I've noticed is that, probably since 1912 there hasn't been this much talk about monopoly in a presidential context, in a presidential race. To what do you attribute that? I mean, why do you think this issue has inspired this interest at this time? Elizabeth Warren: I believe the central question in America today is who government works for. Yeah, it's got a lot of different directions, but that's the fundamental one. Is it just going to work for the rich and the powerful, or is it going to work for everyone else? Antitrust cuts right to the heart of that. We've had a government that has kissed up to every giant corporation for decades. It has weakened antitrust enforcement, looked the other way on mergers, passed on deals that everyone knew were anti-competitive and would be bad for the economy and bad for competition but good for the bottom line of the companies that wanted it. And no one so much as fluttered an eyelash over it. And that's started to change. And I think\u2014So here's my thinking: it's because we're focusing more on what's wrong in this country. It's not like somebody woke up and just said 'antitrust'\u2014we're not that nerdy\u2014but it's about what's wrong in this country. And as people increasingly see that the problem is not an overreaching government, the problem is a government that won't get in the fight on the side of the people. Antitrust becomes one of the clearest places to see that. DD: Now youdid a speech at the end of 2017[3], you talked about this issue, and at the beginning of the speech you said something like, you know, people don't have to know the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to know that there's something wrong. EW: Exactly. DD: But how do you talk about it on the trail? How do you talk about it to really drive that home so that it doesn't get bogged down in numbers and economic theory and stuff like that? EW: It's important to give examples of how it touches people's lives. So when I talk about Amazon, for example, I talk about the platform where everybody goes to buy coffee makers and pet cookies, and that the platform works great. But that Amazon does something extra. It's not just an ordinary marketplace. It's a marketplace where Amazon, the owner of the platform, sucks up information from every transaction and every near-transaction, the fact that a shopper looked at the item, right, searched for the item, spent a little time hovering, it's been in your cart. And I talk about that. And then they use that information to go into competition with the businesses that are trying to sell you coffee makers or pet cookies. And the consequence of that is that the guy who busted his tail, figured out the pet cookie business, got out there and marketed it\u2014Amazon looks over the edge and says, hmm, profit to be made there, let's do pet cookies, don't even identify it as an Amazon business, and move the guy who built this business back to page seven in the search. Routine, and now Amazon has sucked up one more business. DD: The other issue with Amazon is, that pet cookie business, they take a cut out of every transaction he makes anyway. EW: Exactly, exactly. DD: And they can raise that price, they can change and say, 'Oh, we're charging more for shipping now, we're charging more for storage now.' EW: Every part of it. So, in other words, the way I describe that particular point is, it's like baseball. You can run the platform\u2014that is, you can be an umpire\u2014or, you can have a team in the game\u2014that is, you can run competition against others who are trying to sell the items. But you don't get to do both at the same time. And people in the room all say, 'Right.' That makes sense to me. DD: You just break it down and it makes sense. EW: That's right. DD: So we've seen, very recently, thesehearings in the House[4]on the digital platforms. EW: Yay. DD: And, you know, I'm wondering about your thoughts on the role of Congress in this policy. These are policies that Congress wrote, that they have oversight function on. You know, in the '40s we saw something called the Temporary National Economic Committee, which was a series of investigations into all sorts of sectors over the economy. Do you think, is that something we need now? How can Congress get involved in this? EW: Okay, I'm glad to see Congress doing this. I think it's great. I want them to call witnesses, to let people tell their stories, I want them to expose the data. I want to see the books and records of some of these companies. Remember, Congress has got a lot of muscle if it decides to use it. But I want to make two other points. The first is current law gives the Justice Department and the FTC and the banking regulators a lot of power to move now. Even without Congress, a president who put a strong team in place could change antitrust enforcement in this country, without a single change in the laws from Congress. DD: And it's interesting you say the banking regulators, because people don't realize how much power is in, you know, other agencies, not just the FTC and the Justice Department. EW: Exactly right. I picked banking, but you're exactly right. But it's the reminder\u2014There's a lot we could do right now. But also, and this is what I argue should come out of all this, there are places where Congress should draw a bright line in this. SoI have a plan[5]to break up the big platforms. If a platform is doing more than a billion dollars in business, the platform has to be broken off from all of the ancillary businesses. And there's just\u2014We shouldn't have to litigate it. Just make it happen. It's too much concentration of power. And so I'm both ways on this: there's a lot we can do without\u2014I'm delighted Congress is doing this. There's a lot we can do, even if Congress doesn't change any law. But, there is at least one good place Congress could change the law and make this whole system work better. DD: You mention your plan on the platforms, but you've also made the point that if we broke up Google and Amazon and Facebook tomorrow, we'd have a terrible concentration problem in America. EW: Oh, it's much broader than just that. Platform is such an obvious one and we've\u2014 DD: And everyone interacts with it. EW: That's exactly right the analogy from history where someone\u2014one business\u2014could not only control the marketplace, but also be a dominant player in the marketplace simultaneously. It's not that you can't find them in history. It's that when we found similar economic concentrations in history, we broke them up. DD: Sure, sure. EW: Especially when they started buying everything else. And then, of course, doing\u2014as I recall in the railroads\u2014doing a discriminatory pricing map. Charge themselves a different price from May Lynn's grain outfit. DD: Absolutely. So, I mean, the sort of elephant in the room on this is the judiciary, which has a very particular theory and view of antitrust and even if you put in enforcers that want to take that in a different direction, you still have to argue that in court. So what do you think can be done there? I mean, obviously a new president would have judicial nominations, but you know, that's going to take some time, so how\u2014Is there a way to sort of get the judiciary to realize that they need to do their part here? EW: Use every tool in the toolbox. So part of it is get an aggressive antitrust team. Part of it is presidential leadership. Get out and talk about this issue. And explain to the American people why the laws are working for the big guys and not for them. Encourage the academics to get out and make their case. Remember\u2014 DD: The ones not on the payroll\u2014 EW: I was gonna say\u2014That's exactly right. Remember, it was the academics that got this started in the wrong direction, arguably. DD: I would argue that as well. EW: Yes, exactly, so I think it's all of the above. And, at the same time, move on the congressional front. I just don't want this to feel like, gee, if we can't move Congress, we can't do anything. No. Bang away without Congress, but also, bang away on Congress to make change. Just move on all the fronts. DD: Excellent, excellent. And finally, there's a famous\u2014It was Richard Hofstadter wrote this thing in the '60s. And he said\u2014And the title of it was 'What happened to the antitrust movement?' EW: Yes. DD: That there was a movement that created all these laws and then the movement sort of went away and said, 'Regulators will take care of it.' It seems like a movement is what is necessary at some level, and how do you inspire that? EW: Okay, now let's move back up to the 10,000 feet where we started this, because I think that's what this is all about. When we started this conversation, I said that I think the question is who government works for. I think much of the antitrust relaxation over time in the '60s was confidence the government would handle this. Confidence that we had regulators who knew their stuff and who were technically adept and who had shown that they would be on the side of the American public. And when the big corporations started pushing back, started advancing the academic work that said, 'No, let the giant corporations do whatever they want. What could possibly go wrong?'\u2014That it's taken a long time for people to see the implications of that. Look, for 40 years now, the mantra in Washington and in most of the Republican Party and a big chunk of the Democratic Party has all centered around Ronald Reagan's 'What are the nine worst words in the English language? I'm from the government and I'm here to help.' Ha ha ha. The idea that it's government that poses the threat to all of the rest of America and must be held at arm's length, and missing the fact that it's government that balances out the power of these giant corporations. And without an effective government to enforce antitrust laws\u2014and other laws\u2014we're all in trouble. DD: Well, it's the idea that if there's\u2014If government takes away the regulation, the regulation doesn't go away, it's just in the hands of the giant corporations. EW: It's just in the hands of the giant corporations. DD: So they get to do regulation from the boardroom. EW: And that's how we keep hearing lately about self-regulation. Aircraft manufacturers that self-regulated; how did that work out? You know, it's\u2014But it's over and over. It's wait, what? They're doing what? The oil companies that were doing the drilling offshore were self-regulating? You know, they filed some reports that nobody read. That's not a government that's working for the public. So when you say about, is it going to take a movement? The answer's yes. That is the movement we're starting to build. This interview has been edited for publication.

It all comes down to power: who has it, and who doesn't.    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big corporations have become so dominant that workers and consumers have fewer options and have to accept the wages and prices these giant corporations offer. This has become even worse now that thousands of small businesses have had to close as a result of the pandemic, while mammoth corporations are being bailed out.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, worker bargaining power has declined as fewer workers are unionized and technologies have made outsourcing easy, allowing corporations to get the labor they need for cheap.     </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These two changes in bargaining power didn't happen by accident. As corporations have gained power, they've been able to gut anti-monopoly laws, allowing them to grow even more dominant. At the same time, fewer workers have joined unions because corporations have undermined the nation's labor laws, and many state legislatures - under intense corporate lobbying - have enacted laws making it harder to form unions. </p><p>Because of these deliberate power shifts, even before the pandemic, a steadily larger portion of corporate revenues have been siphoned off to profits, and a shrinking portion allocated to wages.</p><p>Once the economy tanked, the stock market retained much of its value while millions of workers lost jobs and the unemployment rate soared to Great Depression-era levels. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/hwyvjvZO5Ls\">https://youtu.be/hwyvjvZO5Ls</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To understand the current concentration of corporate power we need to go back in time.</emphasis></p><p>In the late nineteenth century, corporate power was a central concern. \"Robber barons,\" like John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt, amassed unprecedented wealth for themselves by crushing labor unions, driving competitors out of business, and making their employees work long hours in dangerous conditions for low wages. </p><p>As wealth accumulated at the top, so too did power: Politicians of the era put corporate interests ahead of workers, even sending state militias to violently suppress striking workers. By 1890, public anger at the unchecked greed of the robber barons culminated in the creation of America's first anti-monopoly law, the Sherman Antitrust Act. </p><p>In the following years, antitrust enforcement waxed or waned depending on the administration in office; but after 1980, it virtually disappeared. The new view was that large corporations produced economies of scale, which were good for consumers, and anything that was good for consumers was good for America. Power, the argument went, was no longer at issue. America's emerging corporate oligarchy used this faulty academic analysis to justify killing off antitrust. </p><p>As the federal government all but abandoned antitrust enforcement in the 1980s, American industry grew more and more concentrated. The government green-lighted Wall Street's consolidation into five giant banks. It okayed airline mergers, bringing the total number of American carriers down from twelve in 1980 to just four today. Three giant cable companies came to dominate broadband. A handful of drug companies control the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p>Today, just five giant corporations preside over key, high-tech platforms, together comprising more than a quarter of the value of the entire U.S. stock market. Facebook and Google are the first stops for many Americans seeking news. Apple dominates smartphones and laptop computers. Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The monopolies of yesteryear are back with a vengeance.</emphasis></p><p>Thanks to the abandonment of antitrust, we're now living in a new Gilded Age, as consolidation has inflated corporate profits, suppressed worker pay, supercharged economic inequality, and stifled innovation. </p><p>Meanwhile, big investors have made bundles of money off the growing concentration of American industry. Warren Buffett, one of America's wealthiest men, has been considered the conscience of American capitalism because he wants the rich to pay higher taxes. But Buffett has made his fortune by investing in monopolies that keep out competitors.</p><p>- The sky-high profits at Wall Street banks have come from their being too big to fail and their political power to keep regulators at bay. </p><p>- The high profits the four remaining airlines enjoyed before the pandemic came from inflated prices, overcrowded planes, overbooked flights, and weak unions. </p><p>- High profits of Big Tech have come from wanton invasions of personal privacy, the weaponizing of false information, and disproportionate power that prevents innovative startups from entering the market. </p><p>If Buffett really wanted to be the conscience of American capitalism, he'd be a crusader for breaking up large concentrations of economic power and creating incentives for startups to enter the marketplace and increase competition.</p><p>This mega-concentration of American industry has also made the entire economy more fragile - and susceptible to deep downturns. Even before the coronavirus, it was harder for newer firms to gain footholds. The rate at which new businesses formed had already been halved from the pace in 1980. And the coronavirus has exacerbated this trend even more, bringing new business formations to a standstill with no rescue plan in sight. </p><p>And it's brought workers to their knees. There's no way an economy can fully recover unless working people have enough money in their pockets to spend. Consumer spending is two-thirds of this economy. </p><p>Perhaps the worst consequence of monopolization is that as wealth accumulates at the top, so too does political power.</p><p>These massive corporations provide significant campaign contributions; they have platoons of lobbyists and lawyers and directly employ many voters. So items they want included in legislation are inserted; those they don't want are scrapped. </p><p>They get tax cuts, tax loopholes, subsidies, bailouts, and regulatory exemptions. When the government is handing out money to stimulate the economy, these giant corporations are first in line. When they've gone so deep into debt to buy back their shares of stock that they might not be able to repay their creditors, what happens? They get bailed out. It's the same old story.</p><p>The financial returns on their political investments are sky-high.</p><p>Take Amazon - the richest corporation in America. It paid nothing in federal taxes in 2018. Meanwhile, it held a national auction to extort billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies from cities eager to house its second headquarters. It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back away from a tax on big corporations, like Amazon, to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the city's sky-high rents, caused in part by Amazon!</p><p>And throughout this pandemic, Amazon has raked in record profits thanks to its monopoly of online marketplaces, even as it refuses to provide its essential workers with robust paid sick leave and has fired multiple workers for speaking out against the company's safety issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">While corporations are monopolizing, power has shifted in exactly the opposite direction for workers.</emphasis></p><p>In the mid-1950s, 35 percent of all private-sector workers in the United States were unionized. Today, 6.2 percent of them are.</p><p>Since the 1980s, corporations have fought to bust unions and keep workers' wages low. They've campaigned against union votes, warning workers that unions will make them less \"competitive\" and threaten their jobs. They fired workers who try to organize, a move that's illegal under the National Labor Relations Act but happens all the time because the penalty for doing so is minor compared to the profits that come from discouraging unionization. </p><p>Corporations have replaced striking workers with non-union workers. Under shareholder capitalism, striking workers often lose their jobs forever. You can guess the kind of chilling effect that has on workers' incentives to take a stand against poor conditions.</p><p>As a result of this power shift, workers have less choice of whom to work for. This also keeps their wages low. Corporations have imposed non-compete, anti-poaching, and mandatory arbitration agreements, further narrowing workers' alternatives. </p><p>Corporations have used their increased power to move jobs overseas if workers don't agree to pay cuts. In 1988, General Electric threatened to close a factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana that made electrical motors and to relocate it abroad unless workers agreed to a 12 percent pay cut. The Fort Wayne workers eventually agreed to the cut. One of the factory's union leaders remarked, \"It used to be that companies had an allegiance to the worker and the country. Today, companies have an allegiance to the corporate shareholder. Period.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, as unions have shrunk, so too has their political power. In 2009, even with a Democratic president and Democrats in control of Congress, unions could not muster enough votes to enact a simple reform that would have made it easier for workplaces to unionize.</p><p>All the while, corporations have been getting states to enact so-called \"right-to-work\" laws barring unions from requiring dues from workers they represent. Since worker representation costs money, these laws effectively gut the unions by not requiring workers to pay dues. In 2018, the Supreme Court, in an opinion delivered by the court's five Republican appointees, extended \"right-to-work\" to public employees. </p><p>This great shift in bargaining power from workers to corporate shareholders has created an increasingly angry working class vulnerable to demagogues peddling authoritarianism, racism, and xenophobia. Trump took full advantage. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All of this has pushed a larger portion of national income into profits and a lower portion into wages than at any time since World War II.</emphasis></p><p>That's true even during a severe downturn. For the last decade, most profits have been going into stock buybacks and higher executive pay rather than new investment. </p><p>The declining share of total U.S. income going to the bottom 90 percent over the last four decades correlates directly with the decline in unionization. Most of the increasing value of the stock market has come directly out of the pockets of American workers. Shareholders have gained because workers stopped sharing the gains. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So, what can be done to restore bargaining power to workers and narrow the widening gap between corporate profits and wages?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For one, make stock buybacks illegal,</emphasis>as they were before the SEC legalized them under Ronald Reagan. This would prevent corporate juggernauts from siphoning profits into buybacks, and instead direct profits towards economic investment. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Another solution: Enact a national ban on \"right-to-work\" laws,</emphasis> thereby restoring power to unions and the workers they represent. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Require greater worker representation on corporate boards</emphasis>, as Germany has done through its \"employee co-determination\" system. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Break up monopolies</emphasis>. Break up any bank that's \"too big to fail\", and expand the Federal Trade Commission's ability to find monopolies and review and halt anti-competitive mergers. Designate large technology platforms as \"utilities\" whose prices are regulated in the public interest and require that services like Amazon Marketplace and Google Search be spun off from their respective companies. </p><p>Above all, antitrust laws must stop mergers that harm workers, stifle competition, or result in unfair pricing. </p><p>This is all about power. The good news is that rebalancing the power of workers and corporations can create an economy and a democracy that works for all, not just a privileged few.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1594284860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609V-4NY1-DYTP-R431-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

It was the least turbulent part of the day. We open with some grim news on today's BradCast[2] before moving on to some shockingly encouraging news out of....wait for it....Congress of all places! [Audio link to full show is posted at end of summary.] First up today, former Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain succumbed[3] to the coronavirus. </p><p>As co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, the 74-year old Cain attended Donald Trump's controversial mask-free rally in Tulsa on June 20. By July 2nd he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and now dead a month later. He wasn't the only high profile Republican to pass away from the coronavirus today. Bill Montgomery also died[4]. He was the 80-year old co-founder of the rightwing \"student group\" (yes, a GOP student group founded by an 80-year old!) called Turning Point USA. The organization hosted Trump's second, similarly mask-free rally after Tulsa in Phoenix. Despite claims by both Cain and Montgomery's group that hydroxychloroquine was \"100% effective\" in treating coronavirus, turns out, as the FDA has emphasized, it isn't. Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis was finally laid to rest[5] on Thursday in Atlanta, where he was eulogized by three former Presidents. Trump did not attend after also failing to pay his respects while Lewis lay in state at the U.S. Capitol earlier this week. President Obama, however, offered stirring remarks in memoriam, calling for the expansion of voting rights which Lewis spent a lifetime --- and no small amount of blood --- fighting for. The former President's remarks came shortly after our current President feebly suggested[6] on Twitter that the November election should be delayed \"until people can properly, securely and safely vote,\" charging that \"2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp;#38; FRAUDULENT Election in history\" due to the use of mail-in ballots needed to counteract the dangers of in-person voting during the pandemic that Trump utterly failed to control. That controversial call for delaying the election --- immediately and universally rejected by Republicans and Democrats alike --- was largely to a) further propagandize Trump's supporters into believing the November election results will be illegitimate and, more immediately, b) distract from the horrific economy news[7] released by the federal government just minutes before Trump's tweet. The news he was hoping to distract from: The U.S. economy plunged a staggering, unprecedented, annualized 32.9% in the second quarter of this year. By way of comparison, it took three years before the economy fell 30% during the Great Depression. This has happened in months, as another 1.4 million workers filed for new unemployment claims last week. It was the 19th week in a row of record-shattering 1 million plus applicants, leaving some 30 million Americans now jobless, as Republicans in Congress have failed to extend the expanded unemployment payments from he CARES Act. Those benefits have expired as of this week, and neither Congressional Republicans nor the White House appear to have an acceptable plan to replace them. House Democrats passed their own $3 trillion HEROES Act[8] several months ago to continue those payments and much more critical relief to workers, states and cities, hospitals, homeowners, the U.S. Post Office and many others through the end of the year. Republicans appear to be in stultifying disarray[9]. But there is some good news today and, believe it or not, it comes out of Congress! The U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday held a five-hour hearing on Big Tech monopolies, featuring the CEOs of Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai) and Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg) as witnesses. All of them where grilled by Democrats and, yes, even Republicans alike for years of runaway, anti-competitive business practices. Progressive Matt Stoller's coverage of the hearing at The Guardian was headlined \"Congress forced Silicon Valley to answer for its misdeeds. It was a glorious sight.\"[10] Our guest today, DAVID DAYEN, author[11], investigative financial journalist and Executive Editor of the progressive American Prospect, filed a piece with the exhuberant hed: \"The Triumphant Return of Congress,\"[12] following up his 175-tweet live thread[13] from his Wednesday coverage. Dayen tells me today that it was \"probably the most consequential hearing on corporate power in decades,\" where one CEO after another was called on the carpet to answer for years of crushing, anti-competitive practices in their sectors. He reports that the \"members of that subcommittee,\" headed up by Democratic Chair David Cicilline of Rhode Island, \"knew exactly what they wanted to talk about. They knew who they wanted to target. This is the culmination of a year-long investigation and these members had an incredible amount of knowledge about the harms that these four large corporations have been causing through the exertion of their power.\" \"They really extracted confessions from Bezos and Zuckerberg and others about the practices they engage in which really are illegal,\" he says. The hearing couldn't have been better timed for Dayen, coming just a week or so after the publication of his new book Monoplized: Life in the Age of Corporate Power[14] documenting the breathtaking reach of unchecked corporate mergers and consolidation over the past four decades. He explains on today's show, as he does in the book, how century old anti-trust laws were turned on their head during the Reagan Administration, when a theory promoting the idea that monopolies are actually good for consumers was advanced by one Robert Bork. The theory would eventually prove untrue by its own standards. It was not good for consumers and, Dayen describes, failed to take into account the damage that anti-competitive practices actually wrought on small business, employees and the supply chain itself --- leading directly to some of the dangerous consequences and ridiculous shortages we've seen during the COVID crisis in everything from toilet paper to critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment. \"This hearing was a complete indictment of the Federal Trade Commission and the anti-trust division of the Justice Department, who had access to all this information that the subcommittee had. They had all of these documents. They had all of the ability to conduct an investigation. In fact, it's their job to do so,\" Dayen observes. \"They did not do that, and waved through merger after merger after merger, and the people who had that authority, under Democratic administrations and Republican administrations, who were responsible for this failure should not be listened to again, and they should not hold power again.\" Dayen is hopeful that Wednesday's hearing may actually spur action --- grant permission, if you will --- to the FTC and DOJ to start upholding those unenforced anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws and regulations that remain on the books. \"The only way that gets done is that the momentum from this hearing is built, where a popular movement to understand and work against the power of monopolies is what is going to carry us forward. It has in the past. That's how we got these laws in the first place, because people demanded the political system respond, and it's how we're going to get them now.\" I should note here that I make a personal cameo appearance in Dayen's new book (beginning on page 85, if you must know) discussing my own personal experience with the anti-competitive monopoly practices in the media industry, and how the unchecked \"sale\" of our public airwaves to a handful of mega-media corporations has led directly to all of the various disasters --- political, economic, societal and, yes, medical --- that are now rending apart our very republic. Dayen, whose indispensable daily \"Unsanitized\" column[15] at The American Prospect chronicles the continuing eroding state of our national battle with the global coronavirus pandemic and its ever-worsening toll on our economy, closes by bringing us up to date on the disastrous Republican effort to craft a new emergency relief bill in Congress, as expanded unemployment benefits expire and the U.S. Postal Service faces implosion just months away from the largest vote-by-mail election in the nation's history...

[ Audio link to full show is posted at end of summary. ]    First up today, former Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain succumbed to the coronavirus. As co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, the 74-year old Cain attended Donald Trump's controversial mask-free rally in Tulsa on June 20. By July 2nd he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and now dead a month later. He wasn't the only high profile Republican to pass away from the coronavirus today. Bill Montgomery also died . He was the 80-year old co-founder of the rightwing \"student group\" (yes, a GOP student group founded by an 80-year old!) called Turning Point USA. The organization hosted Trump's second, similarly mask-free rally after Tulsa in Phoenix. Despite claims by both Cain and Montgomery's group that hydroxychloroquine was \"100% effective\" in treating coronavirus, turns out, as the FDA has emphasized, it isn't.    Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis was finally laid to rest on Thursday in Atlanta, where he was eulogized by three former Presidents. Trump did not attend after also failing to pay his respects while Lewis lay in state at the U.S. Capitol earlier this week. President Obama, however, offered stirring remarks in memoriam, calling for the expansion of voting rights which Lewis spent a lifetime --- and no small amount of blood ---  fighting for.    The former President's remarks came shortly after our current President feebly suggested on Twitter that the November election should be delayed \"until people can properly, securely and safely vote,\" charging that \"2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history\" due to the use of mail-in ballots needed to counteract the dangers of in-person voting during the pandemic that Trump utterly failed to control. That controversial call for delaying the election --- immediately and universally rejected by Republicans and Democrats alike --- was largely to a) further propagandize Trump's supporters into believing the November election results will be illegitimate and, more immediately, b) distract from the horrific economy news released by the federal government just minutes before Trump's tweet.    The news he was hoping to distract from: The U.S. economy plunged a staggering, unprecedented, annualized 32.9% in the second quarter of this year.  By way of comparison, it took three years before the economy fell 30% during the Great Depression. This has happened in months , as another 1.4 million workers filed for new unemployment claims last week. It was the 19th week in a row of record-shattering 1 million plus applicants, leaving some 30 million Americans now jobless, as Republicans in Congress have failed to extend the expanded unemployment payments from he CARES Act. Those benefits have expired as of this week, and neither Congressional Republicans nor the White House appear to have an acceptable plan to replace them. House Democrats passed their own $3 trillion HEROES Act several months ago to continue those payments and much more critical relief to workers, states and cities, hospitals, homeowners, the U.S. Post Office and many others through the end of the year. Republicans appear to be in stultifying disarray .    But there is some good news today and, believe it or not, it comes out of Congress! The U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday held a five-hour hearing on Big Tech monopolies, featuring the CEOs of Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai) and Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg) as witnesses. All of them where grilled by Democrats and, yes, even Republicans alike for years of runaway, anti-competitive business practices. Progressive Matt Stoller's coverage of the hearing at The Guardian was headlined \"Congress forced Silicon Valley to answer for its misdeeds. It was a glorious sight.\" Our guest today, DAVID DAYEN , author , investigative financial journalist and Executive Editor of the progressive American Prospect , filed a piece with the exhuberant hed: \"The Triumphant Return of Congress,\" following up his 175-tweet live thread from his Wednesday coverage.    Dayen tells me today that it was \"probably the most consequential hearing on corporate power in decades,\" where one CEO after another was called on the carpet to answer for years of crushing, anti-competitive practices in their sectors. He reports that the \"members of that subcommittee,\" headed up by Democratic Chair David Cicilline of Rhode Island, \"knew exactly what they wanted to talk about. They knew who they wanted to target. This is the culmination of a year-long investigation and these members had an incredible amount of knowledge about the harms that these four large corporations have been causing through the exertion of their power.\"    \"They really extracted confessions from Bezos and Zuckerberg and others about the practices they engage in which really are illegal,\" he says. The hearing couldn't have been better timed for Dayen, coming just a week or so after the publication of his new book Monoplized: Life in the Age of Corporate Power documenting the breathtaking reach of unchecked corporate mergers and consolidation over the past four decades. He explains on today's show, as he does in the book, how century old anti-trust laws were turned on their head during the Reagan Administration, when a theory promoting the idea that monopolies are actually good for consumers was advanced by one Robert Bork. The theory would eventually prove untrue by its own standards. It was not good for consumers and, Dayen describes, failed to take into account the damage that anti-competitive practices actually wrought on small business, employees and the supply chain itself --- leading directly to some of the dangerous consequences and ridiculous shortages we've seen during the COVID crisis in everything from toilet paper to critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment.    \"This hearing was a complete indictment of the Federal Trade Commission and the anti-trust division of the Justice Department, who had access to all this information that the subcommittee had. They had all of these documents. They had all of the ability to conduct an investigation. In fact, it's their job to do so,\" Dayen observes. \"They did not do that, and waved through merger after merger after merger, and the people who had that authority, under Democratic administrations and Republican administrations, who were responsible for this failure should not be listened to again, and they should not hold power again.\"    Dayen is hopeful that Wednesday's hearing may actually spur action --- grant permission, if you will --- to the FTC and DOJ to start upholding those unenforced anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws and regulations that remain on the books. \"The only way that gets done is that the momentum from this hearing is built, where a popular movement to understand and work against the power of monopolies is what is going to carry us forward. It has in the past. That's how we got these laws in the first place, because people demanded the political system respond, and it's how we're going to get them now.\"    I should note here that I make a personal cameo appearance in Dayen's new book (beginning on page 85, if you must know) discussing my own personal experience with the anti-competitive monopoly practices in the media industry, and how the unchecked \"sale\" of our public airwaves to a handful of mega-media corporations has led directly to all of the various disasters --- political, economic, societal and, yes, medical --- that are now rending apart our very republic.    Dayen, whose indispensable daily \"Unsanitized\" column at The American Prospect chronicles the continuing eroding state of our national battle with the global coronavirus pandemic and its ever-worsening toll on our economy, closes by bringing us up to date on the disastrous Republican effort to craft a new emergency relief bill in Congress, as expanded unemployment benefits expire and the U.S. Postal Service faces implosion just months away from the largest vote-by-mail election in the nation's history...

Uniformed staff discreetly prowl the five-storey townhouse, making sure they attend to the well-heeled guests' every whim.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It could be a branch of Soho House or any one of the chi-chi boltholes for the wealthy that have sprung up like mushrooms in the capital, but this is a club with a difference: it is a luxurious lair for some of London's top accountants and their favoured clientele.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get past the flunkies and inside the imposing front door, you have to be a partner or customer of the accountancy firm KPMG. That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain's largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.</p><p>The An audit - essentially an independent check of the books and systems - is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole.</p><p>clients marched disaster shameful It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position. All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort - and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.</p><p>And all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.</p><p>The behaviour of the Big Four auditors - Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG - has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years - from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa - has erupted with no advance warning.</p><p>As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.</p><p>The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in 'recklessness, hubris and greed' at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scotfree and continue to enrich themselves with impunity - unless they are finally called to account.</p><p>KPMG's audit shame IN THE plush, self-congratulatory backdrop of Number Twenty, it seems preposterous to imagine that KPMG has been at the heart of a string of the worst corporate failures of recent times - but that is exactly what has happened.</p><p>At the bar, partners sip cocktails overlooked by four Warhol-style portraits. The pop art prints on the walls are not of celebrities, but of the founders, Messrs Klynveld, Peat, Marwick and Goerdeler, whose initials spell out the name of the firm. One can only imagine what these frugal fellows would make of their firm nowadays. They might be amazed as today's partners lift a champagne glass to celebrate the billions that pour in every year from clients. They might also feel a sting of shame at the way KPMG's reputation has taken a hammering.</p><p>In the year to the end of September, it pulled in nearly \u00a32.2billion of revenues. The average UK partner took home nearly \u00a3520,000 - and for the top ones, it would have been much more. It is a similar story at the other three top firms. But in KPMG's case, it has a long and unhappy list of audits for firms that have gone to the wall. Not least of these was HBOS, the former Halifax Building Society, which had merged with Bank of Scotland before pursuing an aggressive list of who to is lending policy that ended in its ruin. KPMG earned \u00a356million from auditing HBOS in the eight years before its downfall and a further \u00a345million in consultancy fees.</p><p>Astoundingly, the audit firm's boss in the UK at the time, John Griffith-Jones, went on to chair regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, one of the watchdogs charged with investigating the collapse of HBOS. Politicians who gave the green light to his appointment were either unaware of, or untroubled by, the glaring conflict of interest. KPMG also gave unblemished audit certificates to Bradford &amp; Bingley, a former building society that had overstretched itself in the buy-to-let market and which duly disappeared in the credit crisis.</p><p>Similarly, the Co-operative Bank, chaired at the time of its disgrace by Paul Flowers, was able to wave an immaculate audit report courtesy of KPMG shortly before its implosion.</p><p>Another former client was HSBC, which six years ago was found guilty of widespread money laundering for drug barons and rogue states. In yet another unremarked conflict of interest, the bank's former finance director turned chairman, Douglas Flint, was an old boy of KPMG. The list of its clients who marched to disaster clutching a clean audit certificate is a lengthy and shameful one. Carillion, which was audited by KPMG for the entire 19 years of the outsourcing firm's existence, is just the latest disgrace.</p><p>The accountants raked in \u00a329million of fees, before Carillion collapsed under a \u00a31.5billion debt pile earlier this year.</p><p>MPs investigating the disaster, which affected hospitals including an urgently needed new building in Liverpool, declared that: 'KPMG should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.' If past experience is a guide, it seems unlikely.</p><p>KPMG is not alone. All of the Big Four have handed spotless audit reports to companies that turned out to be riddled with losses and fraud, yet they continue, largely unpunished and entirely unrepentant.</p><p>Luxleaks: the tax avoidance factory IN JANUARY this year, a bespectacled young man emerged from a Luxembourg courtroom, swathed in smiles. He was Antoine Deltour, a whistleblower extraordinaire, whose revelations had shed an astonishing light on the activities of one of the world's leading accountancy firms, PwC.</p><p>The court had just vindicated his crusade by overturning a suspended prison sentence he had been given for leaking information to the media. He had discovered the orchestration of tax avoidance on a grand scale by PwC, the world's largest accountancy firm, in the Grand Duchy.</p><p>As a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC's Luxembourg office in 2010, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret 'advance tax agreements' between his firm's clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.</p><p>Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500 'rulings' involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the 'Luxleaks' scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years.</p><p>Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office. PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman's agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax division.</p><p>The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.</p><p>Tax avoidance isn't new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has How football away morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry - and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.</p><p>bribery so long? Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GLAXOSMITHKLINE held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way - all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.</p><p>Caught offside ACCOUNTANCY failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world's top ten football officials with arrest warrants.</p><p>Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.</p><p>How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.</p><p>From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags.</p><p>A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.committee.No\">www.committee.No</url> alarm was raised.</p><p>But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><p>The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa's successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.</p><p>Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner's dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a coordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79 million Swiss francs over five years.</p><p>In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said 'shortcomings' had been found in KPMG's work between 2008 and 2014 and one individual was reprimanded.</p><p>Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced \u00a318.99.

The onetime Goldman Sachs senior executive mounts a vigorous defense of the 2017 tax bill, calling it a victory for supply-side economics and for the American people.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past decade the gap between income growth for ordinary Americans and that for their wealthiest countrymen has widened at a rate unseen since the Gilded Age. As a result, populists now openly challenge neoliberalism from both the left and the right. Talk of tax cuts and trickle-down effects by financial elites is a rearguard action fought on behalf of a crumbling economic consensus. Like the delusional Vietnam War\"\"era generals who pointed to rising body counts as progress toward victory, Mr. Cohn, President Trump, and others frequently refer to a soaring stock market and low unemployment as indicators of a \"surging economy.\"</p><p>At this point many of us understand that beneath the hood, the once powerful American engine of mass prosperity is malfunctioning. When 10 percent of the American population owns 80 percent of equities, a 35 percent gain in the Nasdaq is a vanity metric rather than a true indicator of system performance. Similarly, low unemployment rates mask the neo-serfdom of the sharing economy \"\" and thus tell only part of the story.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>To borrow a metaphor from writer Anand Giridharadas, tussles over the American economy have played out in just two different \"stadiums\" since 1932.\u00a0 </p><p>The Stadium of Franklin Delano Roosevelt stood on a New Deal consensus from the mid-1930s until well into the 1970s. Policymakers in both parties sought to limit the concentration of economic power, decentralize the corporate sector, and ensure free and fair competition for small business. In the mid-1970s, American politicians abandoned this accord for the Stadium of Ronald Reagan, where subservience to the free market and an abiding skepticism of government became shibboleths in both parties. It may have been Reagan who convinced Americans that their government was out to get them, but it was a Democratic president from rural Arkansas who gutted the federal bureaucracy in the mid-1990s and then used his State of the Union address to brag about it.\u00a0</p><p>The one thing \"\" perhaps the only thing \"\"\u00a0 that the left and the right seem to agree on today is that the current field of play no longer seems so prosperous for the average citizen.\u00a0</p><p>Following leaders like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one team and Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley on the other, people are looking for the exits. Where they will go is unknown, but whether closure comes in 2020 or a few years later, the lights are flickering in the House that Ronnie Built.\u00a0</p><p>Matt Stoller's Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy is a timely guide for those looking to understand how, where, and by whom the next stadium will be built. Goliath's central assertion is that to understand why our economy distributes its fruits so unevenly, you must recognize what many elites and policymakers struggle to see: The present-day prevalence of monopolies and other significant concentrations of economic power is unprecedented in American history.\u00a0</p><p>His time on Capitol Hill during the financial crisis propelled Stoller into a decade-long exploration of American economic history. In Goliath he unearths a century's worth of antitrust debates to show the consequences of monopolization and economic concentration. For decades, American antitrust battles were led by a seemingly forgotten assemblage of anti-monopolists that includes John Sherman, Louis Brandeis, and America's most famous class traitor, Franklin Roosevelt.</p><p>The book's unlikely hero, however, is Congressman Wright Patman, the son of an East Texas tenant cotton farmer. The populist Patman's 46-year career in the House of Representatives, launched on the eve of the Great Depression, mirrors the rise and fall of the New Deal economy. Patman was instrumental in passing the Bonus Bill for World War I veterans; he also led impeachment proceedings against then\"\"Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon. He was, as one eulogizer said, a man who \"comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable.\"\u00a0</p><p>In 1975 a group of newly elected Democrats known as the \"Watergate Babies\" deposed the elderly Patman as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. That Patman's ouster came neither at the hands of Republicans nor at those of his enemies on Wall Street is a central point in Goliath: In their zeal to end the Vietnam War and enact civil rights legislation, Democratic legislators ceded thought leadership on matters of political economy to a rising technocratic elite. Patman \"\" elderly, white, and Southern \"\" fell victim to the grandfathers of today's woke capitalists.\u00a0</p><p>A credentialed technocracy soon led the Democratic party astray. Well-intentioned, corporatist liberals undermined the New Deal consensus, allowing Chicago School libertarians to peddle simplistic views of the relationship between the government, the citizen, and the economy. Stoller reserves his sharpest critiques not for Big Business or Wall Street, but rather for educated elites on his own team who, after a century of looking out for small businesses, farmers, and workers, quickly abandoned them for free trade, private equity, and, eventually, Amazon.\u00a0</p><p>To ensure the complete and lasting victory of neoliberalism, its forces buried the New Deal vocabulary. Financial elites, their allies on Capitol Hill, and a not-yet-discredited cadre of libertarian economists dismantled the guardrails on capitalism erected by New Deal policymakers from both parties. Thereafter, to suggest that the market might need some degree of oversight was to invite scorn and derision.</p><p>The resurrection of the anti-monopoly lexicon and its history is a positive step toward a new economic consensus. So is the fledgling movement to build a 21st-century industrial policy, incubated by intellectuals on the right and now embraced by mainstream politicians. Business culture also appears to be shifting, and it has once again become possible to be \"pro-business\" while objecting to returns earned through labor arbitrage. Even JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon now suggests that the efficiencies-over-everything-else shareholder economy might not be right for our democracy.\u00a0</p><p>Throughout Goliath, Stoller asserts that the past century's antitrust struggles can and, indeed, must inform the challenges in front of us. A conversation about Amazon is incomplete without understanding the pitched battles that unfolded in the 1930s between federal regulators and the A&amp;P chain store. It might surprise young investors and managers today to discover that for decades, American law protected producers' ability to price their own goods. The monopoly issue is also one of national security: As we grapple with the implications of Big Tech's cozy relationship with an ascendant, cyber-forward China, we might look to the 1930s, when the federal government belatedly intervened to prevent Standard Oil and Alcoa from helping Hitler reconstitute the German war machine.\u00a0</p><p>For investors it is Stoller's discussion of the impairment of small business that is most valuable. From the turn of the 20th century until the mid-1970s, American policymakers deliberately structured the economy to support the producer and reward production. Reaganism \"\" with plenty of help from the New Democrats \"\" inverted this order of operations, asserting the consumer as the prime mover (and beneficiary) of American capitalism. As Amazon shows, anticompetitive and illegal behavior, not to mention widespread labor abuse, is now tolerable, as long as the annual letter to shareholders proclaims the right amount of \"customer obsession.\" Stoller rightly points out how neoliberalism's consumer focus not only distorts our economy, but also perverts the economic rights of democratic citizenship, reducing them to opportunities to obtain goods quickly and buy them cheaply.\u00a0</p><p>For all of the bleating about innovation at business schools and elsewhere, American entrepreneurship is in a perilous state. Despite a ten-year bull market, annual small business formation is still at only two thirds of its pre-recession levels. Over a longer horizon the picture only grows bleaker. In the 1970s new firms (defined as those less than one year old) accounted for approximately 15 percent of all American businesses. Forty years later that percentage hovers in the mid-single digits. Our winner-take-all economy is creating fewer businesses and, as a result, inferior investment opportunities. Our business culture now seems purpose-built to celebrate founders and companies whose entire business model can be described as seeking monopoly, while avoiding mention of the collateral damage to other sectors of the economy.\u00a0</p><p>Populism has long been a dirty word to the business community. When it comes to the crude, incoherent Trump variant, corporate America may be forgiven for being dismissive of what is far more likely to be a transitory presidency than one that results in a new ideological stadium. But the anger that propelled Trump to office is not an aberration. Behind the scenes a new cohort of conservative intellectuals are preparing for his departure, whether it occurs this year or in 2024. Like Fox News television host Tucker Carlson, they may disagree vehemently with liberals on the social issues, but when it comes to the economy, they are far closer to Elizabeth Warren than Paul Ryan. Their progressive counterparts have taken notice, laying the groundwork for the establishment of a new stadium in the near future. </p><p>There are still those who assure us that everything is all right. They lack either the honesty or the nuance to have a conversation about what share buybacks, tax cuts, and prolonged low interest rates are doing to the economy. You can find a slew of them at The Wall Street Journal, people with little skin in the game mounting ardent defenses of the status quo against critics both foreign and domestic and admonishing the populists for their rhetorical excesses.\u00a0 </p><p>But investors dismiss an increasingly bipartisan economic populism at their own peril.\u00a0</p><p>As Julius Krein, founder of the \"American Affairs\" journal and an ardent critic of Reagonomics, highlighted recently, American class conflict might soon reach a front closer to home: Millennial HENRYs (High Earners Not Rich Yet) working in finance, law, and consulting have started to realize that when it comes to the fruits of a distorted, monopolized economy, they too will be on the outside looking in. America's top 9.9 percent, who still depend primarily on professional labor to accumulate wealth, are on a strikingly different trajectory from the top 0.1 percent, who earn via capital gains. For the first time, America's young bourgeoisie is calling into question the return on investment of an arrangement that requires outsize student debt, climbing coastal living costs, and delayed family planning.\u00a0</p><p>These trends should interest those who allocate capital with a long-term view. As a new generation of antitrust crusaders in Congress takes up the debate, investors would do well to participate constructively in the conversation. A new stadium will be built, and its potential location and ground rules will be influenced, at least in part, by whether or not those who control and administer capital are able to confront just how bad things have gotten. This will be a challenging shift in mind-set \"\" from the luxury boxes the game always looks pretty good.</p><p>Besides, in the nosebleeds they are celebrating their tax cuts.\u00a0\u00a0\"}}</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INSIAE-b1jz6grn07x012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INSIAE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5T-7CD1-JD1P-T0P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318073</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institutional Investor (America's Edition)</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

The lack of another round of stimulus in the U.S., a spike in virus infections in Europe and ongoing U.S.-China frictions weighed on equities. But not all the developments were downbeat, as the Fed, ECB and BoJ reaffirmed commitments to maintain accommodation for as long as it takes for a self-sustaining recovery to emerge. Vaccine development continued to progress, supporting optimism that the pandemic will eventually subside. </p><p>It will likely be another turbulent month for the markets in October, as investors continue to juggle the implications of the economic data, virus/vaccine developments and the upcoming U.S. election.News was mixed on the virus: Europe saw a spike in cases associated with the summer travel season, which prompted a return to stricter measures from some governments in the region. The jump in cases prompted worries in the U.S. that a similar scenario could play out this fall, hampering the recovery. Meanwhile, the development of a vaccine continued to make headway, with efforts by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson in late stage trials. The total number of people infected in the U.S. topped seven million as of late September, and 203k having died of the disease according to John Hopkins data. U.S. stimulus hopes were resuscitated in the last weekend of September after Speaker Pelosi said \"I believe we can come to an agreement,\" with the \"we\" referring to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. She said she is ready to make a new \"proffer\" shortly. The agreement on a CR to keep the government running into the new fiscal year supposedly helped move the two sides to a deal, though they are still far apart with the Democrats wanting a $2.2 tln amount and the Republicans wanting a much smaller \"skinny\" package. President Trump has reportedly said he could support a $1.5 tln level. The big sticking points remain extra unemployment insurance and funding for state and local governments U.S. China relations remained tense, with Beijing undecided on green lighting an agreement to allow TikTok to become a U.S. based firm. In August, an executive order from President Trump forced the firm to sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. firm or be banned from doing business in U.S. A federal judge subsequently denied the implementation of the ban, leaving the ban and sale in limbo. While this is just one facet of the complex U.S.-China relationship, the enmity on both sides (each nation views itself as the aggrieved party on the TikTok matter) speaks to the low level of cooperation, which in turn lessens the upside for a sustained global recovery. FOMC: Flat Rate Path Ahead The FOMC further codified its lower-for-longer 0%-0.25% rate stance in its first policy meeting (September 16) since the framework review. The policy statement and SEP estimates took a circuitous and somewhat contradictory path to get there. There were two dissenters, Kaplan and Kashkari. Chair Powell said it wasn't surprising to see a range of opinions with respect to the new policy posture, and especially with the big changes in the economy due to COVID-19. Yet, the FOMC member forecasts showed a wide range of estimates for the economy, and a minority of members expected rate hikes despite low inflation estimates that suggested a low tolerance for inflation overshoots.There wasn't any real clarity from the policy statement or from Chair Powell's comments, where he tried to explain the new posture and strategy under the Framework Review. The markets were fully priced for a dovish stance, and they got it in spades as the FOMC underscored its lower for longer rate stance. The Fed is now \"aiming\" for an above 2% inflation rate for some time. However, the markets got a little more than they bargained for with respect to the dot plot, which showed several rate hikes in the future.The Congressional testimony from Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin didn't reveal anything new or surprising. Chair Powell pushed back against comments that the Fed has \"bailed out\" banks and some other misconceptions about the Fed's actions, including backstopping corporate debt. Both Powell and Mnuchin did argue for more fiscal stimulus, with Mnuchin emphasizing a more targeted approach for kids and hard hit sectors and industries. The Treasury Secretary lamented the problems in the commercial real estate market and the inability to address them, though he and Powell are working on it. He noted there is some $134 bln in leftover PPP that could be repurposed. He didn't think the administration had the authority to act unilaterally to forgive loans of less than $150,000. The ECB meeting saw the bank remaining in a wait and see stance, with officials still firmly committed to the very expansionary monetary policy and the PEPP program. Lagarde suggested the PEPP is still expected to be used in full. While the \"low for very long\" message remains in place, there was nothing to suggest that the ECB is in fact preparing additional easing measures. On the contrary, Lagarde not only played down the importance of the negative HICP rate for August, but actually suggested deflationary pressures have receded somewhat compared to June. The meeting was a confirmation of the wait and see stance, with the ECB still committed to a highly accommodative monetary policy stance. The Bank of Japan remained pledged to do whatever it takes to support the recovery, as expected. Interestingly, the BoJ minutes highlighted that some council members are becoming concerned that virus developments will negatively impact the recovery. On the political front, PM Abe resigned due to health reasons. New PM Suga is expected to maintain policy continuity. Economic Trends The U.S. economic recovery continued, contrasting with fears in late August that a pick-up in virus cases and unwind of the CARES act would significantly sap momentum. Indeed, our estimate for Q3 GDP is tracking a 32.5% rebound in growth (q/q, saar) after the -31.4% plunge in Q2. The Q2 GDP data captured the powerful impact of mandatory closures, which left Q2 contraction rates of 20%-40% for most measures of demand, and larger 50%-65% declines for foreign trade. We saw a fifth consecutive quarterly inventory subtraction from GDP that left a record pace of inventory liquidation in Q2. The inventory plunge left considerable room for an inventory rebound into the end of the year.The shift in the U.S. national consumption basket has left demand for many goods and services well above the prior trend, but comes alongside a massive shortfall in demand for restaurant, travel, and entertainment services. Housing may be the starkest example of an industry that is now expected to function well above prior output levels. We still expect business fixed investment in the second half of 2020 to be depressed by weakness in construction of nonresidential structures as the commercial real estate market sorts itself out. Yet, it is noteworthy that many measures of aggregate activity have now more than fully reversed the pandemic-hit, and are setting new highs. In the Eurozone, inflation measures fell into negative territory. The HICP was confirmed at -0.2% y/y in the final reading for August, in-line with expectations. The sharp decline from the 0.4% y/y rate in July was largely due to special factors though, including the temporary cut to the German VAT rate and the delay of summer sales in some countries. Part of the negative inflation environment was also due to still low energy prices, which remained down -7.8% y/y, even if the measure has improved from the low of -11.9% y/y seen in May. Meanwhile, an increasing number of new infections have led to renewed travel restrictions, quarantine measures and regional lockdowns. Hence, concerns are on the rise that the still fragile Eurozone and UK recoveries will be disrupted. While we expect an 8.2% bounce in Q3 GDP (q/q, sa) after the -12.0% plunge in Q2, the market will closely monitor the data released through October for cracks in the recovery.Japan's core CPI remained negative in September, with government travel discounts largely to blame. However, inflation was subdued even without the discounts, and is well below the government's 2% target. Specifically, Tokyo core CPI contracted -0.2% y/y in September after the -0.3% drop in August. National core CPI fell -0.4% y/y in August after the flat readings (0.0%) in June and July. The measure fell -0.2% in both April and May and has not grown since March's 0.4% rise. Final GDP, released in early September, showed a -28.1% tumble in Q2 (q/q, saar), a slight downward revision from the -27.8% drop in the first release. The focus has turned to the magnitude of the expected rebound in Q3, which we've tentatively pegged at 14%. All eyes will remain on the monthly reports during October as GDP estimates are refined -- Q3 GDP is not due until November 16. China's economy appeared to further distinguish itself from the struggling global economy, although the global economy remains a potent source of uncertainty for China's export driven growth model. The official manufacturing PMI improved to 51.5 in September from 51.0 in August, notching the seventh consecutive month the index has been in expansionary territory after posting a record low 35.7 in February. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 55.9 in September from 55.2 in August, marking the strongest reading since the all-time low of 29.6 in February and consistent with the ongoing strength in services. China was the only growing economy in Q2, rebounding to a 3.2% y/y growth rate after tumbling -6.8% in Q1. We expect Q3 GDP, due October 19 and sure to be scrutinized by the market, to improve to a 4.5% y/y pace.Market Developments Equities came under pressure through September, ending the remarkable rally that stretched to early September. Relentless uncertainty finally took a toll on investor optimism, as the lack of fresh fiscal stimulus in the U.S., pocket of rising virus cases stateside, and a rise in infections in Europe prompted fresh worries regarding the durability of the U.S. and global recovery. In addition, U.S. election jitters were thrown in the mix, with a rancorous first presidential debate seeming to add to the perception that the results of the election will be highly contested. Still poor U.S.-China relations remained a concern. In short, stock market valuations were challenged by still elevated uncertainty, prompting some profit taking though the month of September.The rip roaring rally on Wall Street peaked on September 2, with all three indexes sliding lower through the remainder of the month. The NASDAQ ended September -8% below its record high close set on September 2, having shot 76% higher from March lows to the early September peak as investors bet (correctly) that big tech would outperform in the pandemic economy. The S&amp;#38;P 500 reversed -7% from its all-time high seen on September 2nd, having roared 60% higher from March lows to the record-high closing level. The Dow dropped -6% compared to its September 2nd level (it was the best since March, but not an all-time high), trimming the 57% gain from March lows to the early September peak. After the losses in September, the NASDAQ was 62% above its March low, the S&amp;#38;P 500 was up 49% and the Dow was 47% higher. Meanwhile, modest declines were evident in Europe and the UK: the Euro Stoxx fell -2% by late September versus the end of August, Germany's DAX was off -1% and the UK's FTSE 100 dipped -1%. The gains relative to March lows were 35%, 52% and 18%, respectively. As for Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was 0.2% firmer by the end of September compared to the last session of August while China's CSI dropped -5% over the same period. Longer dated Treasury yields eased lower into month end after perking up early in September, although the 10-year Treasury was confined to a relatively narrow range. The Fed's ZIRP and the further confirmation that rates will be at current levels for a long time helped anchor rates, while nascent inflation fears and a heavy supply outlook provided support. The 10-year yield moved lower to 0.645% as September came to a close after posting a month high (close basis) of 0.718% on September 4. Global sovereign yields were weaker as well. The German 10-year Bund fell to -0.546% from -0.400%. The UK's Gilt contracted to 0.193% from 0.334% in late August. The 10-year Japanese Government bond (JGB) slid to 0.009% from 0.048% in late August, having tested 0.0% late in September.WTI crude oil traded in a narrow range around the $40 level through September amid concerns over reduced global demand. The global demand for crude oil remains weak relative to pre-COVID levels, suggesting that crude oil prices will struggle to gain traction going forward.Demand worries weighed on the Reuters/CRB commodity index, as did likely profit taking. The index fell -4% to 147 by the end of September from its post March peak of 153 at the beginning of September. It bottomed out at 106.3 in mid-April as oil prices collapsed. Gold prices fell -8% to $1,897 by late September after posting a record high $2,063.55 in early August. Gold traded at $1,529 to begin 2020. Bank of England Looks into Negative Rates as Risks Mount Initially it seemed as though the BoE meeting would not offer up surprises with the central bank keeping all policy settings on hold, the statement suggesting that consumption is stronger than expected at the time of the August inflation report and the outlook for inflation slightly higher. That would back the wait and see stance that was the main message of the statement. The minutes, however, were surprisingly dovish, and showed that officials were briefed on negative rates. This reflected the high uncertainty over the outlook, with the balance of risks tilted to the downside and banks eager to be prepared for negative shocks, which at this point would also include a no-deal Brexit scenario. The main message from the BoE was no real surprise, and this confirmed the wait and see stance. The bank rate was left unchanged at 0.1% and the target for the total stock of assets was kept steady at GBP 745 bln. The overall message was that of cautious optimism on the outlook, with the BoE saying that high frequency data suggests that consumption is now \"around its start-of-year level in aggregate, stronger than expected in the August Report.\" Investor intentions have remained weak but projections for GDP in this quarter are somewhat better than previously expected.The central bank did acknowledge that inflation fell from 1.0% in July to just 0.2% in August, but highlighted that this was mainly the result of temporary factors relating to the Government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday accommodations and attractions. While inflation is expected to remain below 1% until early next year, the statement still highlighted that the trajectory until then is slightly higher than expected last month. So at first glance it was a slightly less pessimistic statement, even if the statement also highlighted that the number of paid employees has fallen by around -700K between February and August and that there is still considerable uncertainty on how the labour market will fare once government job support schemes unwind. This also means that there is still the risk \"of a more persistent period of elevated unemployment than in the central projection.\" The BoE also warned that uncertainty remains very high, which means that it is unclear how informative data are \"about how the economy will perform further out.\" Indeed, the statement highlighted that \"the recent increases in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity.\" The statement concluded that the BoE will continue to monitor the situation closely and \"stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit.\" The BoE also promised that the Committee \"does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. In essence then a pretty similar assessment than Lagarde delivered last week. But what the statement did not mention is the fact that MPC members were in fact briefed on negative rates.However, like in the Eurozone, where comments from council members since the meeting revealed that there are at least some council members who are more uneasy about the outlook and seem to lean towards a further extension of the PEPP program, the BoE minutes also reveal a somewhat more differentiated picture. After the August Monetary Policy Report discussed the effectiveness of negative policy rates as part of the central bank's policy toolkit, the MPC was subsequently briefed on \"the Bank of England's plans to explore how a negative Bank Rate could be implemented effectively, should the outlook for inflation and output warrant it at some point during this period of equilibrium rates. The Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority will begin structured engagement on the operational considerations in 2020 Q4.\" So despite the slightly better than expected developments since the August meeting, the Bank of England is preparing for a worst case scenario amid heightened uncertainty. The elephant in the room that was suspiciously absent from the statement was the deterioration in U.K.-EU relations since the last inflation report. The minutes highlighted that the August inflation report was \"conditioned on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021.\" If there was a discussions on developments it didn't make it into the minutes, which only said that the \"Committee would consider economic issues relating to Brexit within the context of its wider forecast discussions ahead of the November MPC meeting\".By then discussions on the negative rate will also have started, and the outlook on Brexit may be clearer. For now, it seems pretty much a repeat of last year, with Boris Johnson and his government moving on a confrontation course and going as far as threatening to break international law and go back on the already signed and legally binding Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. The government made a concession, however, by including an amendment to the domestic legislation which would now require a parliamentary vote in the event that the government wanted to invoke the parts of it that would break international law. That amendment alone is unlikely to placate the EU, and while there is still hope in some quarters that Johnson's moves are an attempt to get the EU to soften its stance ahead of the showdown at the leaders level in October, that would likely backfire, as developments will only harden the EU's demand to get legally binding agreements on state aid. And while the U.K. last week celebrated its first major trade agreement outside of the EU, the deal with Japan actually just about replicates the deal the U.K. would have had as an EU member. As the FT[1] highlighted, it also makes more concessions on state aid than the EU demands which, again, will only harden the EU's stance in future talks with the U.K. On agriculture, the U.K. didn't get any new quotas from Japan, but Tokyo conceded that for 10 out of 25 products covered in the EU-Japan deal the UK will be able to use any quota left over by the EU. What this means is that far from being able to make better deals outside of the EU, the U.K. barely manages to replicate those that would have been available as an EU member. And while there may be an agreement in principle with Japan, a no-deal scenario would not just leave the U.K. having to fall back to WTO terms with trade to its closest and most important trading partner, but also the vast majority of countries the EU has a trade arrangement with. Clearly that scenario would have a major impact on growth and inflation developments going forward. Investors were already discounting an expansion of the QE envelope before the end of the year and expectations that the BoE will eventually be forced to join the negative rate camp will clearly increase after the most recent statement.

However, as the month of August began, equities had again largely defied skeptics, although tech stocks were the clear winners while performance was mixed across other sectors. Fixed income richened in July after seeing modest cheapening in June, as worries over the second wave of the viral pandemic, U.S.-China frictions, the government's inability to pass a new U.S. stimulus bill and the whatever-it-takes policy commitments from the core central banks all weighed on bond yields. Market sentiment in August promises to again be whipsawed by a variety of factors, most notably the progress of the pandemic and the impact on the recovery.There was some optimism a U.S. fiscal package will soon be passed following weeks of wrangling in Washington. </p><p>At the time of this writing, there were small positive comments from negotiators, suggesting some progress. Senate Leader McConnell urged an agreement soon, but Republican Senator Perdue said talks could take two more weeks as the Democrats are not \"negotiating in good faith.\" There is still a wide divide on the big issues including the total size of the package, the extra unemployment benefits, evictions, and funding the Postal Service. President Trump has indicated he'll go it alone on the payroll tax cut if he has to. The relationship between the U.S. and China continued to deteriorate. In July, the U.S. ordered China to close its consulate in Houston. China retaliated by ordering the U.S. consulate in Chengdu to close. TikTok has been the latest source of friction, with President Trump pushing for U.S. ownership of the U.S. operations of Chinese firm BytDance's popular video sharing app. On a positive note, the U.S. and China will hold high level talks on August 15 to discuss China's compliance with the bilateral trade agreement signed early this year, reported the Wall Street Journal. Talking is preferable to silence. While some U.S. states reversed re-openings (California did so on July 14), there has been good news on the pandemic. The leading candidate vaccines are reportedly making rapid progress towards final approval and mass distribution. There are well over 100 other vaccines in development. There was encouraging news on the treatment front, as biotech company Synairgen reported what is being touted as the best treatment so far. There is data showing that the novel SARS COV-2 coronavirus is not the apocalyptic event that was feared in March. Fed: Now Triple Not \"Thinking About\" Raising Rates The FOMC remains fully committed to its accommodative stance. Although there were no changes in terms of the 0% to 0.25% rate band, QE, or hints on forward guidance at the July 28,29 meeting, Chair Powell made it perfectly clear that the very accommodative monetary policy posture will be maintained for a long time. In fact, Powell even tripled down on that notion, stressing \"we're not even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates,\" adding one more \"thinking about\" to June's statement. That highlighted the Fed's concerns over the economy and employment due to the pandemic and the willingness to keep accommodation in place until policymakers are \"very confident\" the support is no longer needed. The Fed is hoping for the best in terms of a vaccine but is planning for the worst.There were few changes to the policy statement versus June. Chair Powell cited in the presser the high frequency data that were reflecting a slowing in the recovery. The path forward for the economy remains \"extraordinarily\" uncertain, he said. He repeated several times the sentence from the statement that the \"path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.\" Much will depend on a vaccine. The number of COVID-19 cases has risen sharply, he worried, and said he is seeing signs that it is weighing on the economy. The Fed is \"totally focused\" on providing the economy the support it needs, and the economy will likely need the highly accommodative policy and the use of our tools for an extended time. \"We're absolutely committed to staying in this until we are \"very confident\" the support is not needed.The ECB effectively switched to a wait and see stance at the July 16 meeting, with the initial fire-fighting stage of the pandemic response apparently over. That doesn't mean monetary policy won't remain supportive -- Lagarde tried to calm fears that the central bank may not use the full PEPP envelope while stressing that the central bank will remain on standby. Meanwhile, later in the month, the EU struck a fiscal deal and implemented a EUR 750 bln recovery package. The BoJ kept policy settings unchanged, as expected, while predicting a sharp decline in economic activity during the current fiscal year, although less than the bank's worst case scenario in April. BoJ Governor Kuroda assured that the bank won't hesitate to do whatever it takes if necessary. Economic Trends An historic -32.9% contraction in GDP (q/q, saar) was a highlight of the U.S. data docket in July. GDP dropped -5.0% in Q1. The details of the report were dismal as was widely expected, with consumption plunging -34.6% versus -6.9% in Q1. Fixed investment plunged -27.0% from Q1's -6.7%. Inventories subtracted -3.98% versus -1.34% previously. Exports dove -64.1% from -9.5% (was -9.0%), while imports dropped -53.4% from -15.0% (was -15.7%). Net exports added 0.68% versus 1.13% previously. The chain price index dropped -1.8% from 1.4%, and was the weakest since 1949, with the core rate sliding -1.1% from 1.6% (was 1.7%).With the BEA's figures for the record-decline in Q2 GDP released, we are in a better position to calibrate the record-bounce likely to be reported for Q3. Note that a large rebound is already in place even if the economy doesn't grow at all between July and August, given the climb already booked into June and July from the April bottom. We do expect a continued uptrend in consumer spending through Q3 however, though at a much more moderate pace, and a substantial rebound in trade following an out-sized Q2 hit for that sector. We anticipate a 29.0% rebound in Q3 GDP. The bottom line is that the recovery is continuing despite relentless uncertainty over the virus and government containment measures. Of course, there is always the proverbial \"other hand\" when making economic projections -- high frequency data suggest that the economy may have lost some momentum during July.In the Eurozone, the preliminary Q2 GDP numbers confirmed a sharp contraction in activity, highlighting that even with the emergence of a modest expansion it will take a long time to reach pre-crisis levels of activity. The first estimate of Eurozone Q2 GDP showed activity contracting -12.1% (q/q, sa). National GDP rates varied along the lines of virus developments and depending on the extent of lockdown measures. Spain saw a -22.1% (q/q, sa) GDP plunge, Italy was down -17.3% (q/q, sa) and France fell -13.8% (q/q, sa). Germany, where lockdowns were not as severe as in other Eurozone countries reported a drop of -10.1% (q/q, sa). The second consecutive contraction left overall Eurozone activity down -15.0% y/y in Q2 after a -3.1% y/y loss in Q1. While the results for Q2 were dismal, the report was not surprising. The focus is on Q3, where we expect a 8.2% (q/q, sa) rebound for Eurozone GDP, supported by the easing/ending of lockdowns and massive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. Japan's economy contracted -2.2% in Q1 (q/q, saar) according to the final GDP report for the quarter that was released at the beginning of August. The Q1 contraction was widely expected and should give way to a -30.0% plunge in Q2 (the report is due in the middle of August) as Japan's economy suffered from the virus and containment measures. The easing of containment measures and re-opening of the economy should lift GDP 15.0% in Q3. China stood out as the only growing economy in Q2, rebounding to a 3.2% y/y growth rate in Q2 after tumbling -6.8% in Q1 to mark the worst quarterly performance since the mid-1970s. The bounce in China's Q2 GDP performance of course contrasts with the declines seen in the U.S., Eurozone and Japan during Q2, and left China with only one quarter of contraction compared to the back-to-back GDP losses evident elsewhere. It remains an open question if China already saw the best of its rebound in Q2, given that global activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Factories are widely reported to have returned to full production, though the consumer sector is holding back following the big hits to income and employment in Q1.Market Developments Risk-appetites waxed and waned through July as a variety of factors impacted. Most prominent among those factors was the sustainability of the recovery coming into question as virus cases saw a resurgence in the U.S. and in some other regions. U.S.-China trade tensions provoked worries, while the lack of agreement on another U.S. fiscal package added to the ongoing list of concerns. A very dovish Fed prompted reflection on risk-appetite. There was more good news on the development of a virus and on therapeutics. Underlying the market's moves has been aggressive central bank and government measures to support the financial system and cushion the blow to the economy from the lockdowns. These measures produced a tidal wave of liquidity that had to go somewhere -- Wall Street and other stock markets have been the destination. Corporate earnings for Q2 gushed forth in July, with results running the gamut across industries. Big Tech earnings were very strong, propelling the NASDAQ to fresh record highs.Wall Street stumbled in July, but ultimately moved higher thanks to the leadership of Big Tech stocks, which added to already impressive gains following strong earnings results. Broadly, an acronym soup continues to provide at least a partial explanation for the remarkable run-up from March lows that seemingly flew in the face of dismal fundamentals -- TINA (there is no other option), MOMO (momentum) and FOMO (fear of missing out) have made the rounds as likely explanations for the bull run in stocks. Whatever the reasons, the fact remains that equities have conquered and surpassed the wall of worry that appeared to present an insurmountable barrier in the panic saturated days of March. The NASDAQ rose 8% by early August compared to the beginning of July, the S&amp;#38;P 500 was up 6% while the Dow was down -3%. The Dow was still 44% above its low of 18,591.93 on March 23, which was the weakest level since 2016. The S&amp;#38;P 500 has climbed 48% relative to its nadir in late March. The NASDAQ was up a stunning 59% over the same time frame, notching fresh record highs. Muted gains were evident in Europe -- the Euro Stoxx 50 rose 1% relative to early July, leaving a 36% rise versus the March low. Germany's DAX added another 3% in July, making a 49% rebound from March's low. The UK's FTSE 100 eased -2% lower in July, trimming the gain from March's low to 21%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 improved 2% in July, leaving a 36% climb from March lows. China's CSI 300 rallied 12% in July, leaving a 35% gain relative to March. Treasury yields richened, touching all-time lows to begin August, with the exception of the 30-year bond. The decline in rates came despite the run-up on Wall Street. Treasuries garnered a bid on momentum plays, uncertainty over the fiscal situation, and signs of an economic slowing from some high frequency data. Also, still lofty levels of uncertainty about the pandemic and the economy have kept a strong safety bid in play. Treasuries continue to be viewed as the safest asset, providing still ample demand for U.S. government debt securities.The U.S. T-note fell to 0.5102% in early August from 0.677% at the beginning of July. Global sovereigns saw yields move downwards through July. The German 10-year Bund eased to -0.51% from -0.40%. The 10-year Japanese Government bond (JGB) held near zero, running at 0.0% by early August after perking up to 0.03% early in July. The UK's Gilt eased to 0.074% from 0.21%. The WTI crude oil price surged from the end of April to late July supported by the combination of inventory draw-downs in the U.S., global production cuts, and an improving demand picture as economies have re-opened. The contract rose to $40 by late July (close basis) from $19 at the end of April. WTI crude fell to essentially zero by the middle of April. But the contract was stuck around $40 to $41 range in July as the market mulled still weak demand and a possible increase in supply from OPEC.The Reuters/CRB commodity index improved 6% to 148 by early August from 139 at the beginning of July, leaving a 39% expansion relative to the 106.3 low seen in mid-April as oil prices collapsed. Gold saw a year and record best $2,052 in early August, up 16% from $1,770 in early July. Gold traded at $1,529 to begin 2020. EU and Eurozone Look Stronger After Aid Deal The compromise deal on the EU's recovery fund and the medium term budget is a compromise that manages to gloss over the cracks, without really solving the bloc's underlying problems. The key questions on debt mutualisation and accountability are still being kicked down the road -- yet with a political union of 27 nations with very different political agendas and national economic realities, intricate compromises may always be the best one can hope for. Overall, it helped bolster confidence in the EU and the monetary union, which will go a long way to ensure a recovery from an economic crisis that could have been the end for the ambitious European project. The European Commission proposal for a recovery fund that had topped up the German-French proposal of EUR 500 bln worth of grants to member states by an additional EUR 250 bln in loans had already supported peripheral bond and stock markets. That Germany appeared to realize that this isn't the time for austerity policies helped to boost confidence, especially as Merkel didn't seem to insist on the type of economic reform conditions that were attached to the bailout funds in the wake of the financial crisis. The \"troika\" of ECB, European Commission and IMF that watched over the implementation of what critics claimed were brutal austerity policies, didn't make a comeback. So, even if the balance of grants versus loans was altered in the final compromise -- only EUR 390 bln of the EUR 750 bln total now coming in the form of cash handouts and the rest as low interest loans -- the move was welcomed by the ECB and hailed as a game changer.German Chancellor Merkel may have turned softer in what looks like her last term in office, but she could also afford to be more \"generous\" in her proposal because it was clear from the outset that other countries would fly the flag of caution. Indeed, Netherland's Prime Minister Rutte in particular emerged as the opponent of unconditional cash handouts, partly due to domestic pressure as he is facing a general election in March next year. Italy and the Netherlands also represent very different business models, with government debt amounting to just 48.6% of GDP in the Netherlands last year, compared to nearly 135% of GDP in Italy. Without the ECB's extremely generous monetary policy and the backing of the EU, Italy would face a sharp rise in refinancing costs, rather than heading for record low yields. At the same time, however, private sector debt in the Netherlands is nearly 300% of GDP compared to 155% in Italy. That partly explains why the Netherlands is such a strict opponent of public sector debt mutualisation and unconditional cash handouts, especially as Italy still struggles with the type of structural reforms that would be needed to put the economy and public finances on a more stable footing. The compromise cut back the grant part of the package and Rutte, while failing to secure a veto on payments, managed to at least establish a \"super emergency break\" that allows the delay of payments subject to the review by EU leaders and under the oversight of the European Commission. Rutte also insisted on a clause that will try to get countries to adhere to the EU's rule of law, which seems to be directed mainly at countries like Poland and Hungary, who seem to be flaunting EU rules on issues such as the freedom of press and the independence of the judicial system.This \"emergency break\" looks a bit like the stipulations laid down in the Stability and Growth pact and may not be particularly effective in the end, but it is enough to feed the charges of the right wing Eurosceptics in Italy, who vehemently opposed the idea of national economic plans, even if the Commission stresses that they will be nothing like the austerity policies demanded under the bailout agreements. Still, Salvini, leader of Italy's far-right League, warned that the Commission will demand reforms that will damage Italy. The leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party meanwhile warned that the deal leaves the country at risk of \"an unacceptable takeover of economic-political decisions of a sovereign nation\". These comments highlight the problem, showing that what Italy is looking for is not a joint fiscal policy, which would actually transfer more of the decision making to Brussels, but unconditional cash handouts without any obligations to answer questions on how the monies are spent. That, however, would only further postpone urgently needed reforms, which Italy already avoided by not taking bailout grants during the financial crisis and instead relying on the ECB to buy Italian debt and keep yields low. With the ECB's pandemic emergency program allowing the ECB to more specifically target spreads, and the prospect of sizeable cash handouts from the EU, Italian debt clearly has been one of the main beneficiaries also because the EU's recovery program will be financed through jointly issued debt, which some see as a real game-changer and the first step towards full debt mutualisation. However, in our eyes that is pre-mature -- indeed, this is not the first time that the EU has issued debt. Like the bailout funds, the new wave of EU bond issuance is conditional and clearly focused on a specific purpose. Most importantly, it comes without cross default clauses -- that means individual member states won't become liable if the EU should sink and default. Having said that, the EU's presence in markets will greatly increase now, and with EU debt rated triple A by two of the three big agencies, it will increase the pool of assets the ECB can choose from and make it easier to stick to the capital key condition in its purchase program.Together with the already existing programs, EU market borrowing is estimated to amount to EUR 980 bln by the end of next year, still less than any of the big three, but roughly the size of Spain's bond market. Yields are likely to look more attractive than Germany's and, together with ECB demand, this should secure a good take up. Not quite the secure highly liquid asset EU debt could become if the political situation would finally allow the pooling of debt, but from a market point of view an interesting step in that direction. Confidence not just in the EU, but also the Eurozone project has strengthened and the ability to relatively swiftly (by EU standards at least) agree to such a sizeable and ground-breaking package will go some way to strengthen the unity of the union. That in turn should discourage those in the U.K. that had hoped the united front presented in Brexit talks so far would crumble thanks to the recession and the longer term fallout from COVID-19. However, much of the cross border trade between the U.K. and the EU was due to globalisation trends and real-time supply chains running across Europe. COVID-19 has already sparked a rethink in many quarters and a renewed focus on production capacities closer to home. Hence, the U.K. will remain an important trading partner and clearly one the EU would like to have a deal with, but not one that would undermine the integrity of the single market or allow the U.K. to enjoy the benefits while at the same time setting itself up as a low tax, low regulation competitor on the EU's doorstep. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ACT1107591596715228391263716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACT-8309</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-Y0N1-JCMN-Y3YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3419\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Action Reports</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

The CMA dubbed it a \"revolution\".</p><p>But Mr Blomfield remains unconvinced. \"It is imposing massive costs on challenges like ourselves to implement standards nobody uses,\" he said. </p><p>Repeated<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/25/britains-financial-giants-scuppered-digital-banking-revolution/\">delays from big banks</url>to implement Open Banking standards have left start-up executives furious at the lack of progress. Meanwhile, the tools built by banks to implement the rules to make their data accessible are clunky or fail to work as planned, critics say.</p><p>The Monzo boss went on to criticise consumer credit reforms, brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority, which forced his company to change its 50p per day overdraft charge, instead bringing in an interest-based charge.</p><p>A CMA spokesman said there were 200 providers making Open Banking products and 1 million using the services.</p><p>Mr Blomfield is the latest tech boss to caution the CMA as it expands its efforts to reign in technology giants. The regulator has grown increasingly aggressive in investigation acquisitions and investments by big tech firms in the UK.</p><p>The Monzo founder told the panel acquisitions offered a \"virtuous cycle\" for new founders to launch start-ups and \"it is quite rare that an acquisition offer is accepted unwillingly\".</p><p>This week, CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli defended the regulator's investigations, which include a phase 2 probe into Amazon's $575m investment into UK food delivery start-up Deliveroo.</p><p>Mr Coscelli said: \"The claim seems to be we should not investigate. But you think of the importance of Amazon, you would expect the average consumer would want to be satisfied these acquisitions are good for consumers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-60918333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCD-KVK1-JCJY-G0ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 7, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;
