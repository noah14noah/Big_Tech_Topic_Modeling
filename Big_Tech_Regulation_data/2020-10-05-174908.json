The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>rose 33.38, or 2.86%, to 1198.62. The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nasdaq</emphasis>soared 75.11, or 3.04%, to 2548.94. Pete Najarian said on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" TV show that today's rally was fueled by the participation of the financials in Europe and the U.S. He said the European banks started strong and continued strong, with almost every name closing on their highs.Tim Seymour said the markets got a lift from some encouraging signs from Europe, including a German high court ruling that upheld the government's decision to bail out its troubled neighbors, some good industrial output numbers from Germany and Italy taking an aggressive stance toward budget cuts.

He said a compelling argument could be made that the bottom's in if the market can find its footing and hold at 1140.There was a debate between the Najarian brothers over whether the bottom had been reached, with Jon arguing that the the bottom occurred when the S&amp;P hit 1136. Pete, though, said the financials are still performing too poorly for the bottom to be in.Stephen Weiss took a dim view of the rally, saying there is a still a long way to go before the economy is on firm footing. \"The U.S. political system is a mess.\"Melissa Lee, the host of the show, shifted to tech, which had a big day with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia</emphasis>(NVDA:NYSE) up 8%. Seymour, though, cautioned about a value trap in big tech. He said it's difficult to see a catalyst in a situation where global growth is slowing. Finerman said she found the big tech names like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis>(ORCL:NYSE),<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>(MSFT:NYSE) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco</emphasis>(CSCO:NYSE) a pretty safe place to be.Shifting to the financial sector and the 7% rise in Bank of America shares after its CEO Brian Moynihan shook up management, Finerman said the shakeup offers some insights as to where the bank is heading but she said the bank still has some major albatrosses to deal with. Seymour said it was heartening to see Moynihan going with his No. 1 producers in the new lineup, while Adami said the stock still is vulnerable to headline risks and he would sell on rallies. Lee noted that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walter Energy</emphasis>(WLT:NYSE) was up 21% today on takeover rumors. Seymour said the mining industry is ripe for M&amp;A activity. Pete Najarian noted that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arch Coal</emphasis>(ACI:NYSE) also looked attractive, saying its P/E was too low.Looking ahead to Obama's jobs program speech on Thursday, Lee asked the panel what would be one thing in the speech that could lift the markets. Finerman said she would be looking for something pro-business in the form of a decrease in the corporate tax, ease in regulations and a repatriation tax holiday. Seymour said the repatriation tax holiday was probably the only substantive measure.CNBC chief political correspondent John Harwood said it was doubtful that the repatriation tax holiday would be a part of the program. He said the plan would call for a continuation of the employee payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits as well as tax breaks for companies that hire. He said there would be money for money for infrastructure spending and hiring of teachers at lower levels.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yahoo!</emphasis>(YHOO:NYSE) rallied today on the news of the departure of its CEO Carol Bartz. Yussef Squali, managing director of Jefferies, mentioned some possible candidates that might be interested in buying the Internet search giant, including<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">News Corp</emphasis>(NWS:NYSE) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>(MSFT:NYSE). He said Microsoft looked like the more likely candidate, given the search partnership between the two companies. He said News Corp's history with the Internet has not been successful and needs a digital strategy.He said Bartz did do some good things but failed to turn Yahoo! into a growth company. Lee commented on how gold seems to be exhibiting a double top formation. Seymour, though, remained bullish on gold, saying he would buy it on any weakness. He said gold has been a 11-year play, adding the same systemic risk factors that have pushed gold higher during that period are still there.Lee also noted that oil was back trading above $80 a barrel. Mike Khouw said he was a buyer of oil stocks, especially the Mid-Continent refiners, which are buying something cheap and selling it at market price. Adding his two cents to the fall playbook, Ron Insana told the panel that volatility remains imbedded in the market, and he doesn't see a drop in the near term.He said the moribund housing industry could get a boost if the government initiated a program of mass refinancing, regardless of equity, that would create a lot of disposal income. He said the country faces a growth crisis that is evidenced in the decline in tax revenues. He said some sort of policy is needed to increase tax revenues.How influential were leveraged ETFs in market swings and closes? Scott Burns, of Morningstar, alluded to study of market action in the first 10 days of August that showed that leveraged ETFs only accounted for 13% of all ETF action transactions. He said leveraged ETF products only accounted for 5% of the trading volume.In the final moves, Khouw liked<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boeing</emphasis>(BA:NYSE). Weiss said he was going to short the euro against the dollar. Seymour said<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alcoa</emphasis>(AA:NYSE) looks good as aluminum prices firm. Adami liked<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xcel Energy</emphasis>(XEL:NYSE) for a natural gas play, while Finerman again preferred<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis>(ORCL:NYSE). Najarian said to keep an eye on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market Vectors Russia ETF</emphasis>(RSX:NYSE).--Written by David Tong in San Francisco.&gt;To contact the writer of this article, click here:.

The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nasdaq</emphasis> rose 49.71, or 2.09%, to 2,425.02.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guy Adami said on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" TV show said the trade going forward is in tech, especially <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM</emphasis>(IBM:NYSE), which he said stood for \"Investors Buying More.\" He said the company, whose CEO is projecting $15 in earnings per share in 2015, is doing \"everything right.\"</p><p>For a breakout of some stocks from a recent \"Fast Money\" TV show,check out Dan Fitzpatrick's \"3 Stocks I Saw on TV.\"</p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"400\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3 Stocks I Saw onTV</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">varconfig = new Array(); config[\"videoId\"] = 84620672001;config[\"playerTag\"] = \"TSCM Embedded Video Player\";config[\"autoStart\"] = false;config[\"preloadBackColor\"] = \"#FFFFFF\";config[\"useOverlayMenu\"] = \"false\";config[\"width\"] = 265;config[\"height\"] = 255;config[\"playerId\"] = 1243645856;createExperience(config, 8);</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Melissa Lee, the moderator of the show, added that Big Blue said it will be making acquisitions over the next five years.</p><p>Tim Seymour said IBM and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco</emphasis>(CSCO:NYSE) figure to do well in the next cycle as corporate spending ramps up.</p><p>Joe Terranova said that an analysis of Cisco's numbers show that cloud computing, including such names as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EMC</emphasis>(EMC:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMware</emphasis>(VMW:NYSE), is the wave of the future.</p><p>Lee noted a Wall Street Journal story that reported that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAP</emphasis>(SAP:NYSE) has agreed to buy <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sybase</emphasis>(SY:NYSE) for $65 a share. Gary Kaminsky said that may be a done deal but to watch for any possible move by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis>(ORCL:NYSE) in this space.</p><p>Jim Goldman, a CNBC reporter, said there could be a bidding war if other suitors step up and challenge the deal. He also said Cisco CEO John Chambers may have sent his company's stock lower in afterhours trading when he issued cautious comments about the economic recovery down the road. However, he said it was \"a big quarter\" for Cisco.</p><p>Brian Kelly expressed doubts whether corporations will spend in an uncertain economic climate that was brought home to investors last week with the plunge in the markets and the $1 trillion bailout in Europe.</p><p>Seymour took issue with that argument, drawing a distinction between corporate balance sheets and sovereign balances, and the seemingly irreversible trend toward a need for greater bandwidth in the future.</p><p>Goldman said Cisco, with $39 billion on its balance sheet, can easily weather any storm.</p><p>Adami said there may be profit taking in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hewlett-Packard</emphasis>(HPQ:NYSE), the next big tech company to report, but he said HP's diversification and strong balance sheet can weather any storm as well.</p><p>Lee noted that gold continued to rally today, up $22. Seymour said the trade is working because gold is perceived as a hedge against currency failure. He also said the miners are finding more gold and getting upgraded.</p><p>Lee referred to a report that said $2.3 billion has moved into gold funds in the past six days. She also said that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPDR Gold Trust</emphasis>(GLD:NYSE) has become the fourth largest ETF.</p><p>Adami wondered whether there were any circumstances gold might fall, while Kaminsky said the gold trade \"seems too easy.\" Seymour, though, was bullish on gold, saying it has been up the past five years.</p><p>Lee said <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whole Foods</emphasis>(WFMI:NYSE) was up 5% after a big beat on the top and bottom lines. Kelly said the stock continues to amaze him because it seems to beat every quarter.</p><p>Lee brought in Stephen Weiss, founder of Short Hills Capital Partners, to comment on reports that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley</emphasis>(MS:NYSE) had misled investors on mortgage-derivative deals.</p><p>Weiss said <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis>(GS:NYSE) will be a bargain after a settlement is reached and there is a change in the management team.</p><p>Kaminsky said it will probably be an industrywide settlement and a shakeup at Goldman that will result in the departure of its CEO and a return to its investment banking culture.</p><p>Should banks be regulated as utilities? Richard Duncan, chief economist at Blackhorse Asset Management, argued the large banks need to be broken up into tightly regulated utilities before they destroy the economy.</p><p>He said the banks have run amok and are putting deposits at risk with their speculation. He said he would choose the FDIC as the regulator.</p><p>Lee noted that master limited partnerships have been on fire so far this year. Darren Horowitz, an analyst for Raymond James, commented on the possibility of a dividend tax, saying it shouldn't have an impact on them.</p><p>Lee said his two risk picks are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enterprise Products Partners</emphasis>(EPD:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plains All American Pipeline</emphasis>(PAA.:NYSE).</p><p>In the under the radar segment, Adami touted <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKesson</emphasis>(MCK:NYSE), which made it onto Goldman's conviction buy list. He said it is fairly valued and a buy above $70.</p><p>In the final trades, Seymour liked <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Empresas ICA</emphasis>(ICA:NYSE). Adami liked <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Precision Castparts</emphasis>(PCP:NYSE) and Kaminsky liked <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CBOE Volatility Index</emphasis>(VIX:NYSE).

The most successful start-up companies in this sector have been able to balance collaboration and disruption, to offer customers a genuine alternative to traditional providers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a recent roundtable in Sydney, start-up entrepreneurs came together with venture capitalists and an executive from the superannuation industry, to talk about ways to strengthen co-operation and rebuild trust with customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FINANCEASIA: For many years the industry has talked about fintech start-ups disintermediating the core business of banks. Do you believe we have reached a stage where the focus is collaboration rather than disruption? TRACY WHYBROW: I was at the recent Sibos conference in Sydney and one of the speakers asked about the future for large corporates. The consensus is that large companies need to create propositions with fintechs and build relationships. It is about choosing the right relationship and creating a mutually beneficial partnership between neo businesses and established institutions.</p><p>PAUL MCCARNEY: The level of collaboration can depend on where your business is located in the world. Different countries have different regulations, particularly around open banking and open data. Banks have two key assets: distribution and access to customers; and data to help them price assets more effectively. Some governments are now trying to open that data to allow fintechs to access it more effectively. Other governments are more cautious, constrained by what they think about innovation and how to protect privacy. In China there is a huge over-investment in innovation that's probably to the detriment of individual privacy. In Europe it is going the other way where there is a shift towards greater privacy for individuals. Geopolitical tension is being caused by these regulatory differences. We believe it is possible to solve this with a federated environment where data and application layers are coalesced for all businesses to access. This is where collaboration will really start to flourish.</p><p>NATHAN WALSH: The most interesting fintech businesses are often balancing collaboration and disruption to offer consumers a genuine alternative to the legacy banks. For example, Athena Home Loans is giving borrowers a better deal by combining a disruptive digital mortgage platform and a unique funding model connecting to superannuation funds.</p><p>FA: This sounds like collaboration also requires buy-in from the regulators. One of the issues for the start-up sector is over-regulation of the market to the detriment of innovation. Where does Australia stand on this point? MCCARNEY: When I speak to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or other regulators, there are concerns about how to manage risk as it branches out from larger organisations to a plethora of smaller organisations. Australian regulators are definitely supportive of start-up innovation through data, having just introduced open banking legislation to enable customers to port banking data between banks and fintechs. The challenge for them is how to appropriately define the detail around accreditation, data handling and use. Regulators are caught between giving consumers better choices while also managing the risk of policy innovation.</p><p>ROHEN SOOD: In a market like Singapore the same regulator oversees data privacy and innovation. The Infocomm Media Development Authority has both the Personal Data Protection Commission which looks after consumer data and the Data Innovation Programme Office as paired sub-entities to help strike a balance between privacy regulation and data innovation. In Australia these organisations are separate, and it would be more helpful to the industry if these were under the same umbrella to allow for a better balance.</p><p>FA: Several of the large banks in Australia now have venture capital arms that invest in fintech start-ups. Tell us more about these alliances.</p><p>TODD FOREST: The establishment of these venture capital arms has changed the way banks approach collaboration. In the past, innovation was often fostered by the four banks coming together and developing a product, such as the payments platform BPay, which was ahead of its time. These days, the banks are using their capital to invest in start-up entrepreneurs - people who are running their own companies and are building businesses that move fast and are agile.</p><p>SOOD: Three of the big banks in Australia have venture arms. We have co-invested with other banks in a number of companies even though sometimes, we might be competing for the same customers. Investment is easier when it is related to cost-out or industry-wide utility opportunities rather than customer facing ones.</p><p>LOUISE WESTERLIND: In Sweden, where I most recently worked with Accenture, the banks have collaborated in a big way by developing BankID, an electronic identification, unique to each customer and used, not only by banks, but also companies and government entities. BankID has been really helpful in setting the stage for new and valuable innovations. One such innovation is Swish, also started by the banks, which is an app initially intended for consumer-to-consumer transactions but now also for consumer-to-business payments. When Swish first launched, there were concerns among the banks about losing business, but over time that discussion has changed. Swedish banks are aware that innovation must be embraced, and there is a need to find ways to work together.</p><p>FA: I wonder if this attitude truly exists in Australia. Some would say that the evolution of the fintech sector here has been slow. What are some of the impediments to collaboration? WHEN 16 November 2018 WHERE Accenture offices, 3 Sussex Street, Sydney Australia PART I C I PANTS Robert Credaro, head of growth assets, First State Super Todd Forest, managing director, NAB Ventures Tony Holt, founder, Square Peg Capital Paul McCarney, co-founder, Data Republic Natalie Nguyen, founder, Hyper Anna Charlotte Petris, founder, Timelio Dominic Price, head of R&amp;D and work futurist, Atlassian MODERATOR Cherie Marriott, Australian correspondent, FinanceAsia Rohen Sood, investment manager, Reinventure Ron Spector, managing director new business, Emerging Tech and Ventures, ANZ Nathan Walsh, co-founder and chief executive, Athena Louise Westerlind, manager, financial services, Accenture Tracy Whybrow, managing director, Second Road, Accenture Strategy CHARLOTTE PETRIS: As the founder of a fintech business, I would say that on the surface there seems to be a willingness to embrace innovation by financial institutions. Yes, we're both in the same industry, we absolutely compete, but we operate in very different ways, reflective of our culture, so the approaches are different. The challenge for financial institutions is embracing a new type of culture, to think in a totally different way. Culture is the biggest hurdle to overcome when we talk about collaboration.</p><p>FOREST: The big banks are caught up in processes and chains of command. They aren't used to operating in an environment that is agile and where the risks are sometimes hard to quantify. I think that is why many banks have set up venture arms or innovation labs. These units are there to bring an outside perspective and to slowly shift the culture.</p><p>RON SPECTOR: There is no doubt there needs to be a shift in culture and a change in the way banks look at opportunities. Venture units like ours are there to introduce ideas into the mothership and bring in people who are evangelists for the portfolio. Sometimes it is about partnerships, but it can also be about timing and knowing that banks can have a two-year backlog on technology projects. Our units are there to chip away at the entrenched culture and advocate for taking new risks.</p><p>DOMINIC PRICE: There is a risk of getting caught up in the terminology. Disruption, innovation and collaboration are just buzz words that all mean distraction for someone working at a bank who has a million processes to consider. What is required is a deep understanding of why we need to do these things.</p><p>SPECTOR: Innovation is very often driven by the need to prop up a failing business. I remember one instance where we were talking to a particular business unit about a strategic shift in their operations, but they didn't want to listen at the time because they couldn't see the benefit. Then we heard that their numbers started to tank and suddenly they were looking for any help they could get to fill those numbers back up. They realised the solution we were proposing could work and they found the funding and the resources to implement it.</p><p>PRICE: That sounds like a classic case of reacting to a burning platform. It would be a whole lot better if companies took a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach. Being one millisecond ahead of the curve is infinitely more valuable than reacting when things start to go south. True collaboration only works if there is a genuine commitment to sharing intellectual property so that both parties benefit and the whole venture grows. Most of the time the focus is on what one party can win over another and this only creates friction.</p><p>PETRIS: This genuine commitment to sharing requires a lot of trust between parties.</p><p>FA: On the topic of trust, there has been a significant loss of trust in financial institutions in Australia following revelations from the Royal Commission into misconduct in the sector. What do you think the big institutions can learn from fintechs when it comes to building trust with customers and keeping it human? WALSH: The Royal Commission has revealed how the legacy players have been broken by their complexity. Successful fintechs bring a single-minded focus on genuine customer needs. Athena's mission is to make the journey to home ownership faster, cheaper and stress-free. We have designed Australia's best home loan experience, enabling a refinance in as little as 15 minutes on your mobile, combined with great rates and exceptional service.</p><p>PETRIS: Our focus is on purpose ahead of profit. The only way we can achieve this - and the most successful fintechs all do this - is to put the customer at the heart of everything we do. Financial institutions have made one fundamental error - they stopped putting customers at the core of their decision-making processes. Fintech companies have been able to step in and address this.</p><p>PRICE: Start-ups don't survive unless they are obsessed with making customers happy. Atlassian is now an established business but our focus is still on growing customers - not so we can show bigger numbers, but because customers benefit from interacting with our products and we want them to do well.</p><p>MCCARNEY: Focusing on the customer experience is what new and nimble companies do well but ultimately a business is only as strong as its ability to grow and attain market share. In the current banking environment, the cost of capital is still a lot cheaper for the incumbents than for new businesses like Athena. Sure, we may have lost some trust in the big banks, but the funding markets don't reflect this. The transition to a time when the cost of capital is level for all players - large and small - will take time.</p><p>SPECTOR: Another element of trust is finding new non-bank lenders that can survive through a downturn. We need businesses that foster a spirit of trust with customers and are scalable, but we also need businesses that can weather market cycles. Right now, the market is trading well and funding for start-ups is fairly abundant. When the market turns, access to capital can dry up quickly and we don't want a situation where we have a bunch of neo-lenders that can't lend anymore.</p><p>FA: Could Australia's superannuation market - which now has assets of A$2.7 trillion ($1.984 trillion) - be a future source of direct capital for start-ups, and maybe even a future source of credit for the loan markets? WALSH: The scale and growth of superannuation is a strong advantage that Australia has over other global markets. The superannuation system is growing much faster than the stock market and the banking system - on a path to exceed $3.675 trillion over the next decade. Fintechs can play an important role in optimising this system to diversify funding sources for credit markets like home loans and corporate lending. And Athena is leading the charge.</p><p>PETRIS: We have been successful in leveraging Australia's unique superannuation market on our funding journey. Early investors in our marketplace were direct super investors but as we have grown, we have secured larger, more long-term sources of funding. Superannuation funds make great partners because it allows them to diversify their existing portfolio and gives us more flexibility around what we can offer to our customers.</p><p>ROBERT CREDARO: The market is evolving fairly quickly. Most superannuation funds invest in start-ups via third-party venture capital funds, but a few are now developing an ability to co-invest in more mature early stage companies, essentially by providing growth equity funding. These steps need to be well thought through as it requires additional internal resources to evaluate and manage, as well as the governance arrangements to support such investments. As far as becoming a provider of credit funding for fintech start-ups, several funds are also taking initial steps in this direction, usually by participating in syndicates alongside the banks, in general lending arrangements to corporates, and in relation to specific asset backed projects. Whether Australian super funds will one day lend into the mortgage markets through disruptors, as you see pension funds in the Netherlands doing, remains to be seen as this is a more competitive market and one where the banks' cost of capital and funding arrangements may produce a greater competitive challenge for new entrants.</p><p>FA: What about the challenges posed by the arrival of global tech giants like Amazon in the Australian market? How will this impact the local sector? SPECTOR: These big companies can have a huge impact on local businesses. The likes of Alibaba, Ant Financial and Tencent through WeChat will eventually make their way to Australia. These companies own customers, they own data and they own platforms that they can push almost anything through. This makes them a real threat.</p><p>TONY HOLT: I agree that this lateral competition probably poses more of a challenge to local fintechs than trying to compete with traditional banks. Many of the world's most successful online financial services companies started their lives as something totally different. They started by offering a product and then found that providing the finance to go with that product was a good proposition. For example, ride sharing companies that became the largest financial services players in their particular market.</p><p>FA: Thinking about large global companies like Alibaba and Facebook also brings up the topic of privacy. How can start-ups balance the need for security and privacy while also relying on big data to drive their businesses? NATALIE NGUYEN: There is a lot of talk about privacy and the internet but there isn't a lot of education about what privacy means and what actually happens with the data that companies collect and how many people handle that data. More than 60% of credit applications in Australia are still being handled manually through traditional channels and yet there doesn't seem to be any concern about privacy or data leakage in this area. Full automation of this application process would actually improve privacy in my opinion. We need more education in the marketplace about what data needs to be protected for privacy reasons and what data can be aggregated and shared.</p><p>WHYBROW: For many people the platforms we use are so complex that it is almost impossible to choose the right privacy settings. We are entering an era where this is going to become more of an issue for individuals and we might get to a point where people start to turn off their applications because they can't get comfortable with their privacy being protected.</p><p>SOOD: Consumers tend to make a trade-off between privacy and utility, certainly in our younger generations where they are so familiar with sharing via platforms that they don't even think about what is happening with their data. Open banking is predicated on user consent, and there is a danger it can be sought from people who think their ability to access the service, or qualify for a loan, is dependent on sharing personal information.</p><p>WALSH: The launch of a legislated Consumer Data Right will deliver huge benefits for consumers, ensuring security and privacy are key to giving Australians control of their data. But in my opinion, the greatest cost to consumers is that they don't have control over the data that would help them to make better decisions. In the mortgage market, consumers pay A$10 billion a year more than they should in rates and fees because they don't control the data that would simplify a switch to a more competitive loan. Today loyalty is not being rewarded. Open banking will unleash real competition.</p><p>FA: Who has ultimate responsibility for protecting data - is it the consumer, the company collecting the data, or the regulators? PRICE: Everyone has to take responsibility. At Atlassian we have a golden rule that we don't screw over our customers. We host data for 130,000 active customers and we need this data to drive the analytics and product innovation that our customers want. But we also have a responsibility to protect that data. This requires having all staff on board with our values because when a data breach occurs in a company it is usually due to human error rather than a technology failure. If data protection is not a core value you start to make very weird decisions in your business. Privacy and consumer rights can't be just a line item in a customer contract.</p><p>WESTERLIND: Data protection can become a reputational liability for banks when they partner with third-party providers. If a data breach occurs as a result of an error made by the provider, banks may take the blame for the breach. Customers don't differentiate, and banks need to prepare for this situation.</p><p>FA: What is the biggest challenge facing technological innovation, and the future for start-ups, in Australia? PRICE: I sometimes think there isn't enough hunger in the Australian market to grow big tech companies and we have become complacent with our good economic fortunes. Of the top 10 companies on the Australian Securities Exchange there is one telco that could be considered a tech company, and even that is a stretch. I would like to see a situation where in 15 years we have a new export market in fintechs.</p><p>WHYBROW: We talk about innovation and I hear Australian banks discussing how they might meet the challenges posed by the arrival of the big technology firms but I don't see them doing a great deal to lead a charge against these potential new market entrants. We need our corporate leaders to be thinking about truly break-out strategies.</p><p>PRICE: This will not happen while companies are focused on protecting existing funding streams at the cost of innovation. We have to remember that Blockbuster invented streaming before Netflix but they killed the idea internally because they worried about it eating into their late-fees revenue. The average tenure of a CEO in Australia is 10 years and they are not incentivised to break new ground. There is no reason to put their necks on the line to invest in long-term technologies.</p><p>SPECTOR: The venture capital market in Australia is at an interesting point in its evolution. Ten years ago there wasn't much activity and global funds were not investing here. In the past five years this has changed significantly and big global funds are flying in to invest in companies like Atlassian, Canva, Airwallex, Athena and Culture Amp. Now we have a bunch of entrepreneurs who are bringing a global perspective to the market.</p><p>HOLT: We need to celebrate our successes more often. We are underplaying who we are and what we can offer. We are at a tipping point where consumers are demanding a different approach to service and product delivery. Innovative companies that are underpinned by a clever tech platform will be the ones who can meet that demand.</p><p>\"TRUE COLLABORATION ONLY  ;  ;  WORKS IF THERE IS A GENUINE  ;  ;  COMMITMENT TO SHARING  ;

But Congress needs to do its part to make Trump's call a success: \"To sustain its standing and remain a relevant player in the unfolding Iran policy, Congress must respond to the president's de-certification by passing a punitive sanctions bill.\" And Trump can bring on the Europeans as well to renegotiating the deal's worst aspects, despite their public hostility to de-certification: \"European leaders are appreciating that the viability of the JCPOA necessitates that America remained tethered to it, and abjuring Washington's desire to revisit the accord only endangers it.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Culture file: Why <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>Made His Movies </p><p><person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>didn't command the heights of high art to mitigate the hypocrisy of how he treated women, Commentary's John Podhoretz argues. It was the crux of the trap: \"People wanted to work with him because of the kinds of movies he made. I think we can see that was the whole point of the exercise.\" He quotes Weinstein's former publishing partner Tina Brown as saying, \"strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women.\" Producing movies and journalism weren't about movies and journalism, then: \"He did it because he needed entities through which he would pass through payoffs both to women he had harassed and molested and to journalists whose silence he bought through options and advances.\" </p><p>  From the left: Misdirected Anger at Silicon Valley Giants </p><p>  There might be good reasons to up regulation on Big Tech, but anger at \"fake news\" and the 2016 election isn't one of them, writes Edward Luce at the Financial Times. \"Companies such as Google may earn their break up. But it should not be because they have subverted democracy. Blame for that must be widely shared. Trust in politics nosedived long before Facebook reached dominance, or Twitter was launched.\" Just like the war on drugs continues to fail because it hasn't stopped demand, social media has taken the shape of its users, he insists: \"Suppose Facebook could debar any foreign money from making political ads, and Twitter weeded out every Russian bot and troll. Would it alter the tone and content of America's politics? I very much doubt it.\" </p><p>  From the right: Trump Is Following the Law on O'Care </p><p>  If you want to know why <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>complaints about the media resonate with many Americans, Andrew McCarthy writes at National Review, \"This latest Obamacare coverage is why.\" Media reports have framed Trump's executive order cutting cost-sharing subsidies to insurance companies until Congress appropriates the funds for them as an attack on poor people. But in fact, the law doesn't provide for them - it only provides for subsidies directly to low-income people to offset premium costs, not to insurance giants seeking federal cash: \"The media-Democrat narrative that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is imperiously flouting the rule of law has it backwards. In cutting off the insurance-company subsidies, Trump is enforcing the ACA as written, consistent with his constitutional duty to execute the laws faithfully.\" </p><p>  Vaccine specialist: Stop Fighting That Fever </p><p>  \"The time has come to get over our fear of fever,\" declares Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Writing in The Daily Beast, Offit explains that \"fever isn't an illness. It's the body's attempt to fight illness. So when we treat fever with antipyretics, like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen, we only handcuff an important part of our immune response.\" Studies continue to back this up. So why do we insist on treating fevers? One reason, Offit speculates: \"We assume that if we lessen fever than we have lessened the degree of illness, when the opposite appears to be true.\" Another is that \"we feel more comfortable when our temperatures are normal.\" But we should take that as a sign: \"Fever is a sign that we should isolate ourselves from the herd.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google.  </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYPOST-102083247252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYPOST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR7-5D71-DY2B-12R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 N.Y.P.

Problem is, \"The House's Democratic leaders don't want to impeach Trump because they're afraid that swing voters won't support it and will punish them, in 2020, for overreaching.\" Instead they've done little but stall and posture since the report dropped. Which leaves a situation where \"Mueller and the Democrats pass the buck back-and-forth to each other to no apparent end.\" Which does support a GOP point: If neither the special counsel nor House Democrats will make a formal accusation months after Mueller's report landed, \"then why are we still talking about it?\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Libertarian: Tech Anti-trust Probe Is Empty Theater </p><p>  Reason's Eric Boehm is skeptical that the Justice Department anti-trust investigation of big tech firms is more than a way to appease \"the conservative-led media backlash.\" The Federal Trade Commission and multiple congressional hearings have already investigated \"many of the same issues,\" making it \"unclear what the Justice Department thinks it can add to the show.\" Worse, the \"seemingly open-ended nature of the review creates the opportunity for the Justice Department's anti-trust enforcement powers to be used for obviously political purposes\" to limit online speech President Trump disapproves of. Most important, \"there's little indication that government action is necessary to 'break up' or regulate tech firms\" that actually face \"constant competition\" from smaller companies. With new technologies always emerging, it won't be the feds who end the reigns of Facebook and Google, but the natural impact of \"something you haven't heard about yet.\" </p><p>  Watchdog: Kick Millionaires Off Foodstamps! </p><p>  The Trump administration has finally proposed a rule to close a loophole that \"allows millionaires to collect welfare,\" cheers Kristina Rasmussen at the Washington Examiner. A Clinton administration regulatory move has allowed \"more than 5 million people that don't meet eligibility requirements for assets or income\" to enroll in the food-stamp program, including millionaires and lottery winners. Now an Agriculture Department proposal would \"restore the food stamp program to its original mission: to serve the truly needy, not millionaires.\" The move should receive bipartisan support \"for working to protect tax-payer funded resources for those who truly need them.\" </p><p>  Conservative: Lara Trump's Bid To Win Back Women </p><p>  Lara Trump traveled to suburban Philadelphia last week \"to kick off the 2020 Women for Trump coalition, planting a flag, or at least an olive branch, in some of the least Trump-friendly terrain in the Keystone State,\" reports Salena Zito at RealClearPolitics. The president's daughter-in-law has the \"simple and complicated\" challenge of \"winning the votes of women who didn't vote for him but now find they like his policies while disliking his comportment.\" Victory lies in persuading married suburban women who have historically \"gravitated toward Republican presidential candidates\" and know \"the struggles of maintaining a career and raising a family.\" Lara will focus on the impact of Trump's flourishing economy: \"If the Trump team can successfully make that argument, then perhaps these women will overlook the president's foibles and their disparities with him.\"  </p><p>  Campus watch: The High Priest of Heterodoxy </p><p>  David Mikics at Tablet profiles New York University prof Jonathan Haidt, who by 2015 had grown worried that US universities were becoming like East Germany, \"with the woke students playing the role of the Stasi.\" That year, Haidt co-founded a Web site, Heterodox Academy, to help \"promote intellectual diversity on college campuses and challenge the enforced orthodoxies of academia.\" Haidt, a social psychologist, wanted to \"use the organization to foster viewpoint diversity . . . by providing a supportive outlet to academics with beliefs that stray from the enforced political biases of their field.\" Mikics reports that the \"Heterodox Academy approach is gaining ground, as shown by the growing number of colleges that have adopted the University of Chicago free speech principles, which commit them to ensure 'free, robust and uninhibited debate.' \" - Compiled by The Post Editorial Board </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Lara Trump.  </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYPOST-11249250256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-1H51-JBK8-93XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 N.Y.P.

Even so, Sunday's voting opened a window onto \"the mood of European electorates\" - which turns out to be decisively \"disgruntled and polarized,\" notes Paul, with centrist parties continuing to lose ground to insurgent populists of various shades. Italy's right-wing Lega became the country's largest party in the parliament. In France, far-rightist Marine Le Pen's newly renamed National Rally edged out President Emmanuel Macron's coalition. In Britain, Nigel Farage's newly formed Brexit Party thumped Labour and the Tories. Meanwhile, educated elites gravitated toward the greens, abandoning the \"social-democratic parties they conquered in the early years of neoliberalism and globalization.\" Paul's bottom line: \u00adExpect \"more turmoil ahead.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Albany vet: The High Price of Legislature's Trump Mania </p><p>  The rapid population decline in upstate New York is a \"distressing trend,\" notes Chris Churchill of The Albany Times Union, but Albany Dems are too busy obsessing over President Trump to do anything about it. Last Tuesday, the Assembly passed a bill allowing New York officials to prosecute individuals despite presidential pardons. The next day, it passed legislation \u00adallowing Trump's state tax returns to be released to congressional investigators. That \"all-consuming\" focus on national politics, says Churchill, comes \"at the expense of the locals.\" With upstate continuing to hemorrhage residents despite a booming national economy, Albany must get serious, \"even if it's more fun to target the New Yorker in the White House.\" </p><p>  Populist: Missouri's Upstart GOP Rebel </p><p>  GOP politics are in something of a lull, as the debate over the future of conservatism sparked by the 2016 election stagnates. \"Enter into this scene Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley,\" writes National Review's Michael Brendan Dougherty. Hawley has taken on many favorite Trumpian targets, especially Silicon Valley tycoons. The difference is that Hawley's rhetoric \"invites other conservatives to join in.\" His Big Tech skepticism is \u00adespecially smart politics, Dougherty argues, since these firms \"act like publishers,\" censoring right-wing speech on their servers, without suffering the regulations under which traditional publishers toil. Dougherty concludes: \"Hawley staked out new territory for Republican politicians, based on some of the bleeding-edge conservative thinking on issues of tech and labor policy. For the first time in a long while, I'm excited for what's coming next.\" </p><p>  Conservative: Bring Back the Old Cory Booker </p><p>  As Newark's mayor, Cory Booker was a \"relentless advocate\" for school choice, recalls City Journal's Steven Malanga. The old Booker saw \"the corruption and failure of the Newark school system,\" so he created charters and supported vouchers that set his city on the path to success. But now that he's running for president, Booker no longer champions school choice, and \"his omission suggests the erosion of the coalition between conservatives and liberals tired of failing schools, which originally helped propel school-choice reform.\" To fit in with the left, Booker is allowing his success in Newark to be forgotten, and he seems to have slipped into the view that school choice \"represents a threat, no matter its effectiveness in providing millions of poor kids with better schools.\" </p><p>  Culture critic: Segregation Returns - on the Left </p><p>A National Association of Scholars study of US colleges last month concluded that \"a massive number of schools have institutionalized racial segregation\" in orientation programs, residential arrangements and graduation ceremonies. As Commentary's Abe Greenwald notes, the return of such practices owes to the \"dominance of identity politics\" championed by the left. While segregation was once looked down upon as a sign of intolerance, liberals now embrace such separation as a \"multiculturalist achievement.\" By relentlessly dividing students along the lines of collective identity, argues Greenwald, campus progressives will only \"harm most those they claim to be helping\" by reinforcing social barriers and \"undermining the education of generations.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Josh Hawley.  </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYPOST-1129591038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6T-MS71-DY2B-13V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 N.Y.P.

So Hawkins suggests \"breaking these monopolies up into smaller, more focused entities.\" It's an idea with a long GOP pedigree: Theodore Roosevelt broke up Northern Securities, William Howard Taft broke up Standard Oil and even <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan </nameText></person>broke up Ma Bell. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Arab writer: Israel's New Role in the Middle East  </p><p>  Barring Iran's unlikely capitulation and acceptance of President Trump's terms for returning to the nuclear deal, suggests Abdulrahman Al-Rashed at Arab News, the reactivation of sanctions will give Israel \"a new regional role it has never previously played\" - that of \"a police force that monitors and holds Iran accountable.\" Already, Israel has \"curtailed Iran's strength\" in Syria and says \"it intends to eliminate the Iranian presence\" there altogether. If it succeeds, \"the balance of power among the belligerents would change.\" And, he adds, \"as long as the US administration continues to entrust this new role to Israel, and if it is suitable to the Arab parties, it is likely to expand in the future.\"  </p><p>  From the right: Blue States Now Have To Pay Up </p><p>  For decades, high-tax states with a lot of wealthy residents \"enjoyed a hefty subsidy from the rest of America,\" thanks to full deductibility of state and local taxes, notes The Washington Post's Megan McArdle. Now, under the GOP reform, their taxpayers \"may finally have to confront the full cost of the government they want.\" In recent decades, we've seen \"the ideological beliefs of the Democratic activist base clashing with the geographic and demographic distribution of their voters,\" who've \"crammed themselves into a handful of the most economically successful counties, heavily concentrated in narrow strips along the coasts.\" Eventually, though, they're \"going to have to either give up their big dreams\" of expansive government \"or hand those voters the bill, because they're the ones with most of the money.\"  </p><p>  Media critic: The Press' Last Swoon Over McCain </p><p>  Like \"a beloved major-leaguer playing his final season,\" <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is being \"bombarded by pre-obituary accolades from the press,\" which the Arizona senator \"has long jokingly referred to as 'my base,' \" says Politico's Jack Shafer. But while McCain \"is the subject of the adoration, he's not the cause.\" The media's love for McCain, he cautions, has always been relative: It's \"less about describing who the senator is than who he is not\" - namely, other Republicans. Currently, \"praising McCain is an efficient way to damn Donald Trump.\" But as with all their previous swoons, \"this one will eventually collapse as reporters and commentators on the left recall how conservative he really is.\" After all, when left to choose between McCain and a certain young Democratic senator from Illinois, the press \"swooned hard and long for the newcomer.\"  </p><p>  Policy wonk: Sports Betting Won't Save State Budgets </p><p>  More than a dozen states are likely to follow New Jersey and introduce legalized sports betting, thanks to this week's US Supreme Court ruling. But don't bet on this being good news for taxpayers, warns City Journal's Steven Malanga: \"Advocates have often touted gambling as a magic bullet to generate revenues, but it hasn't delivered. And there's plenty of evidence that it does harm - to people and to the greater economy.\" New Jersey introduced lottery and casino gambling in 1970; today, its residents \"bear one of the nation's highest tax burdens and the state persistently has trouble paying its bills.\" Elected officials for decades have overstated what legalized gambling will bring to state coffers. And gambling's \"dirty secret\" is that \"much of it is targeted at persistent, problem users.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><person><nameText>Sen.

He's the father of TV journalist Alison Parker, who was shot to death on live television.

On the other hand, the president and Republicans are slamming social media platforms for censoring conservative voices.</p><p> Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that's wrong. \"This must change.

En 2017, selon le Washington Post, la firme a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 18 millions de dollars pour influencer le Congr\u00e8s, les agences f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et la Maison-Blanche, une somme qui fait d'elle le champion absolu du lobbying aux Etats-Unis. Avec sa fa\u00e7ade aust\u00e8re, son hall en travaux, le b\u00e2timent ne paie franchement pas de mine. Rien ne signale la pr\u00e9sence de ce mastodonte pesant 830 milliards de dollars en Bourse. Pas question, pour autant, de s'aventurer dans les lieux sans invitation. Un cerb\u00e8re surgit alors, implacable : \u00ab I call the police ! \u00bb Un repli s'impose.</p><p>La tension est palpable. Depuis quelques mois, une temp\u00eate de critiques s'abat sur les Gafa : Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple. Le poids grandissant de ces entreprises inqui\u00e8te. \u00ab La question des concentrations a longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e \u00e0 un niveau local, dans des cercles restreints. Aujourd'hui, c'est un sujet national \u00bb, r\u00e9sume Stacy Mitchell, fondatrice de l'Institute for Local Self-Reliance, une organisation qui d\u00e9nonce les concentrations. Faut-il d\u00e9manteler les groupes qu'un \u00e9ditorialiste du New York Times a baptis\u00e9s les \u00ab Cinq Effrayants \u00bb (Frightful Five), si l'on y ajoute Microsoft ? Et comment s'y prendre ? Plong\u00e9e dans les cercles de Washington, o\u00f9 ces questions obs\u00e8dent.</p><p>\u00ab Ils entravent l'innovation \u00bb L'homme qui a pris la t\u00eate du combat contre les monopoles en Am\u00e9rique s'appelle Barry Lynn. \u00ab Les big tech ont \u00e9cras\u00e9 la concurrence, ils exploitent nos donn\u00e9es et ils entravent l'innovation \u00bb, affirme cet intellectuel aux mani\u00e8res directes et chaleureuses, qui re\u00e7oit \u00e0 un jet de pierre de la Maison-Blanche, dans des bureaux joyeusement color\u00e9s qu'il loue \u00e0 WeWork. En juillet 2017, le chercheur et son \u00e9quipe ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la porte de New America, un think tank o\u00f9 il dirigeait un programme depuis quinze ans. Sa faute ? Avoir d\u00e9plu \u00e0 Eric Schmidt, cofondateur de Google et sponsor de New America, dans un article o\u00f9 il saluait l'amende inflig\u00e9e par l'Union europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 la firme de Mountain View et enjoignait les Etats-Unis de s'en inspirer. Apr\u00e8s cette histoire, le dissident a cr\u00e9\u00e9 sa propre structure. Open Markets Institute, qui emploie 15 chercheurs et n'accepte pas un dollar des entreprises - l'argent vient de fondations -, milite sans rel\u00e2che pour une refonte des lois de l'antitrust. \u00ab Nous voulons revenir aux principes fondateurs de la r\u00e9volution am\u00e9ricaine \u00bb, explique Barry Lynn.</p><p>Sans aller jusqu'\u00e0 vouloir d\u00e9couper en morceaux les g\u00e9ants de la tech, les institutions lib\u00e9rales bon teint s'interrogent aussi sur la toute-puissance des groupes. \u00ab J'ai compris \u00e0 Harvard que les questions des donn\u00e9es personnelles et de leur usage par les plateformes seraient cl\u00e9s pour ma g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00bb, dit le chercheur Martin Chorzempa, au Peterson Institute for International Economics. Le dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 d'HEC et de la Kennedy School d'Harvard - qui parle couramment mandarin, allemand et fran\u00e7ais et a lu la Recherche du temps perdu dans le texte - trouve toutefois la r\u00e9gulation europ\u00e9enne sur les donn\u00e9es \u00ab trop rigide et complexe \u00bb. La place des Gafa est devenue un enjeu politique majeur dans la campagne pour les primaires d\u00e9mocrates en vue de la pr\u00e9sidentielle 2020. \u00ab Une quarantaine de repr\u00e9sentants et une vingtaine de s\u00e9nateurs nous ont assur\u00e9s de leur soutien \u00bb, indique Barry Lynn. Le 30 mars, le d\u00e9bat organis\u00e9 par son institut a r\u00e9uni pas moins de quatre candidats : la s\u00e9natrice du Minnesota Amy Klobuchar, l'\u00e9toile montante du parti d\u00e9mocrate Julian Castro, l'ancien d\u00e9put\u00e9 du Maryland John Delaney et l'ex-professeure \u00e0 Harvard Elizabeth Warren, une des favorites de la primaire. Deux d'entre eux tiennent les plateformes en joue : ex-membre de la commission de la concurrence au S\u00e9nat, Amy Klobuchar a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en f\u00e9vrier, un projet de loi durcissant les conditions des fusions. Quant \u00e0 Elizabeth Warren, elle veut que les groupes r\u00e9alisant plus de 25 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00ab plateformes de service public \u00bb, n'aient plus le droit de commercialiser leurs propres produits : Amazon devrait cesser de vendre ses articles Amazon Basic Products, Facebook se s\u00e9parerait d'Instagram et de WhatsApp, Google ne pourrait plus promouvoir ses propres services.</p><p>\u00ab Je suis d'accord sur le diagnostic mais pas sur les rem\u00e8des \u00bb, r\u00e9agit l'\u00e9conomiste Hal Singer. Cet expert en droit de la concurrence a uuu uuu lui aussi constat\u00e9 les effets d\u00e9vastateurs des concentrations. L'un des pr\u00e9judices les plus graves caus\u00e9s par les big tech est de tuer dans l'oeuf les innovations. \u00ab Une \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de vingt grands fonds de capital-risque de la Silicon Valley montre que la premi\u00e8re raison invoqu\u00e9e pour ne pas financer un projet est le risque que Facebook se l'approprie \u00bb, soulignet-il. L'\u00e9conomiste pr\u00e9conise d'appliquer aux Gafa la l\u00e9gislation qui a rogn\u00e9 les griffes des op\u00e9rateurs t\u00e9l\u00e9coms dans les ann\u00e9es 1990 : les g\u00e9ants de l'Internet auraient l'obligation d'ouvrir leur r\u00e9seau \u00e0 des tiers ; les discriminations seraient jug\u00e9es par un tribunal sp\u00e9cial.</p><p>20 mesures d\u00e9mocrates Son pass\u00e9 d'expert aupr\u00e8s de la Federal Trade Commission - l'autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence - lui a prouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait vain de se lancer dans une proc\u00e9dure antitrust en Am\u00e9rique : les proc\u00e8s, explique-t-il, durent quinze ans et n'aboutissent jamais \u00e0 une condamnation. Certains militent pour une nouvelle autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation. Expert des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, Harold Feld, directeur de l'ONG Public Knowledge, pr\u00f4ne ainsi la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau r\u00e9gulateur. \u00ab L'importance des plateformes d\u00e9borde l'\u00e9conomie. Il s'agit de valeurs, de savoir dans quelle sorte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nous voulons vivre \u00bb, mart\u00e8le-t-il.</p><p>Les intentions et les injonctions se traduiront-elles un jour en textes de loi ? En octobre dernier, le s\u00e9nateur d\u00e9mocrate Mark Warner a propos\u00e9 un arsenal de vingt mesures pour encadrer les plateformes en ligne. Il y sugg\u00e8re entre autres l'adoption d'un texte \u00e9quivalent au R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es (RGPD), l'obligation d'identifier et interdire les robots, des r\u00e8gles plus muscl\u00e9es sur la publicit\u00e9 \u00e9lectorale\u2026 \u00ab Une prise de conscience \u00e9merge, aussi bien chez les d\u00e9mocrates que chez les r\u00e9publicains, sur l'\u00e9norme pouvoir des plateformes. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape avant de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00bb, analyse l'un de ses conseillers dans le bureau 703 du b\u00e2timent Hart, moderne cath\u00e9drale de b\u00e9ton qui loge une partie des s\u00e9nateurs am\u00e9ricains. \u00ab Nous pourrions commencer par une loi sur les donn\u00e9es personnelles, observe Harold Feld. Les r\u00e9formes structurelles prendront du temps. Il a fallu vingt ans et quatre proc\u00e8s avant le Communication Act de 1934 \u00bb, le texte qui a men\u00e9 au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement du g\u00e9ant des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms AT&amp;T. Dans ce processus, les big tech ne l\u00e2cheront rien. A Seattle, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du pays, au si\u00e8ge d'Amazon, o\u00f9 travaillent 40 000 salari\u00e9s, un porteparole s'\u00e9tonne qu'on lui parle de concentrations. \u00ab Amazon op\u00e8re sur un march\u00e9 extr\u00eamement \u00e9clat\u00e9 \u00bb, dit-il. Et ne voit ni le probl\u00e8me ni la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre davantage r\u00e9gul\u00e9.</p><p>Delphine D\u00e9chaux (envoy\u00e9e sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 Washington)</p><p>Sommaire BATAILLE DE TITANS AUTOUR DE LA TAXATION page 45    LE RETOUR DU CAPITALISAME D'OLIGOPOLE page 46    A BRUXELLES, LOBBYING ETFAUX NEZ page 48    LA VIE SANSEUX page 50</p><p>Microsoft, cas d'\u00e9cole judiciaire et industriel</p><p>C'\u00e9tait le proc\u00e8s de la d\u00e9cennie. Lorsqu'en mai 1998, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, suivi par une vingtaine d'Etats am\u00e9ricains, d\u00e9cide d'attaquer Microsoft pour ses pratiques anticoncurrentielles, le jeu du chat et de la souris dure depuis huit ans d\u00e9j\u00e0.    L'entreprise \u00e9tait accus\u00e9e d'abuser de sa position dominante - Windows</p><p>\u00e9quipait plus de huit PC sur 10. Et les \u00e9quipes de Bill Gates ont profit\u00e9 de cet avantage pour d\u00e9molir leur rival Netscape, concurrent de leur navigateur Explorer. La division antitrust a voulu frapper un grand coup. Et en 2000, les juges ont ordonn\u00e9 le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement du g\u00e9ant informatique : le syst\u00e8me d'exploitation Windows serait commercialis\u00e9 par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les logiciels</p><p>applicatifs, comme la suite bureautique Office, par une autre. Mais les cohortes de juristes de Microsoft r\u00e9ussiront \u00e0 trouver un accord amiable, deux ans plus tard. Dans la d\u00e9cennie qui a suivi, l'\u00e9diteur informatique subira une s\u00e9rie d'actions en justice men\u00e9es par la Commission europ\u00e9enne sur ses pratiques anticoncurrentielles. Le groupe sera notamment contraint de donner le choix de plusieurs navigateurs aux utilisateurs de son programme Windows et \u00e9copera d'une amende de 561 millions d'euros pour non-respect de cette obligation. Ces batailles judiciaires n'ont pas d\u00e9truit Microsoft, loin de l\u00e0.</p><p>Mais elles ont favoris\u00e9 l'\u00e9mergence d'un mastodonte dans l'industrie Internet : Android de Google poss\u00e8de aujourd'hui 75 % du march\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'exploitation pour mobile. Microsoft en d\u00e9tient moins de 1 %.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLNGS-149022357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLNGS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2K-1PS1-JDNV-T1D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Challenges tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Challenges</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>9 mai 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The FBI said  they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the  President of the United States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this  has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without  precedent. That is not overstatement.</p><p>And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that  Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him.  None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did  this happen?</p><p>Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not  a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation  and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels  of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing. </p><p>All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would  need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story,  we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret  transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln  Bedroom, no. Think again.</p><p>There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI  assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything  he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public,  standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of  them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's nothing I can  think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way  they are right now.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia?  I'm all for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in  Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you  just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's  their view.</p><p>But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right.  Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's (ph) on the other  side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States.  It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten  our key allies like Japan or Great Britain.</p><p>Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with  Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting  a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin? </p><p>And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the  territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is  very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very  many people, it turns out. </p><p>So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In  Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ROBERT WARNER, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRATIC  PARTY MEMBER, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR OF THE  SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Vladimir Putin policies almost being  parroted by Donald Trump. You had Trump say only nice things about Putin.  He never spoke ill about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States  Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our  enemies. </p><p>So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if  he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with  prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have  spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer.</p><p>Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional  dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian  spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political  positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.</p><p>Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and  this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the  permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent  from their agenda. That's what this is.</p><p>And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd  know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader  gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so  those agencies try to put him in jail.</p><p>It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former  FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking  in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous  country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to,  \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread  our democratic ideals.\"</p><p>So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most  important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all  costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No  wonder Max Boot is on board with this.</p><p>Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too.  They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly  reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause  brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.</p><p>No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly  Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have  determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that.  The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian  crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak (ph) crickets. Whatever!</p><p>The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on.  They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline.  Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying  that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: Well Kristy (ph), the President's tweet trying to make  the case that he's not a Russian asset really just undercuts his own  defense. The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was  written by Putin himself. </p><p>Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting  past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their  actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission. </p><p>Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly  what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just  making Russia's job easier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: You say you're not a Russian agent, therefore, you're a Russian  agent. Who puts these people on TV? That's a question we should think  about. </p><p>Over the weekend, speaking of television, CNN President Jeff Zucker  declared that anyone who isn't spreading fear of Russia is doing the  bidding of Russia. Now, Zucker didn't say that himself, of course. He  rarely speaks in public. Instead, he sent his marionette out, as he often  does, to deliver the message.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN'S RELIABLE  SOURCES HOST, FORMER MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, FORMER  TVNEWSER  EDITOR: I was watching Good Morning America this weekend. And both  mornings, they led with snowstorms and scares at malls and other stories,  and not this. </p><p>And I - I just keep wondering if - if the public is ill-served, if we don't  make it really clear what the stakes of this story are. How - how can a  morning show not lead with this drama, I guess is what I'm saying.</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: I think - I think plenty  of times we lead with - with this drama.</p><p>STELTER: OK. Well, I agree.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: And - and - and with--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So the eunuch (ph) heads to the steps of the palace and reads the  proclamation. Message received, thank you very much.</p><p>But take three steps back. Is the media's problem really that it doesn't  talk about Russia enough? Doesn't seem like that's the problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the President was working for Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was secretly working on behalf  of Russia.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CHARLES CUOMO, TELEVISION JOURNALIST, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Whether  the President was secretly working with Russia against America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of the  Russians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whether President Trump was working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working on Russia's behalf.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the sitting President was secretly working for  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working for Russia from The  Oval Office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes,  it's the DNC.  You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise,  Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is,  does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is  doing the bidding of Russia? </p><p>I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's  say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American  interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive  foreign wars. </p><p>You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made  America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say,  Syria and Libya? </p><p>You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S.  to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American  government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the  name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.</p><p>Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S.  would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state.  Their economy is dependent on energy.</p><p>But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done  just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my  lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil  and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not.</p><p>Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones  pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and  gas wells across the nation. Huh! </p><p>Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so  many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the  task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical  transparency.</p><p>Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of  Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly  didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read  by the federal government, on what basis? </p><p>We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it.  He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the  Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa  Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials.</p><p>Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for  reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And  we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the  reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. </p><p>They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New  York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information  when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents  might embarrass the FBI.</p><p>This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this  country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of  federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government,  bring in some sunlight. </p><p>Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them,  and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected  leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the  people, and not the other way around.</p><p>The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his  own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him  a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have.</p><p>Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  of New York, and he joins us tonight. </p><p>Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The  Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like  FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an  appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, FORMER ASSISTANT  UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: No, it's not,  Tucker. It's not a - appropriate pretext for the FBI for any investigation. </p><p>And I must say that, you know, listening to your monologue, it occurs to me  that, you know, since the Soviet Union fell, it's been the purpose of this  government it seems, under administrations of both parties, to treat Russia  as if it were England.</p><p>And I remember, you know, the Obama debate with Mitt Romney where, you  know, Romney suggested that Russia was a geopolitical, our greatest  geopolitical enemy, and Obama mocked him for that. Obama--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --on a - in a conversation with Medvedev, who is basically the  cat's paw for Putin, you know, says thinking he's not being heard, you  know, as soon as I get by this election, I'll have more flexibility. I -  imagine if Trump had said these sorts of things.</p><p>But I - I must say, listening to all that, it - it seems like Trump is the  guy who was left without a chair when the music stopped, because all of a  sudden, everything that was regular and fine is now, you know, now - now  Trump is - I'm sorry, Russia's back to being, you know, I guess we're back  in the Cold War.</p><p>And look, I - I think I probably find Russia to be more of a threat than  you do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But the FBI is not supposed to be doing policy. That's not their  job.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean why was there no - but and there's a lot that we don't  know. But from that story, and no one has contested the basic facts that I  have seen, officials in the FBI sat down and decided it is unacceptable for  an elect - elected leader to come to these policy conclusions therefore,  there must be some sinister motive. </p><p>Why did no one in the FBI say, \"Wait a second. This is demonstrably not our  job. We're not allowed to do this.\"</p><p>MCCARTHY: Because they didn't start doing it in May 2017. In May 2017,  Tucker, all they did was, as a formal paper matter, they opened an  investigation, specifically, on Trump. But it was the same investigation  that had been being conducted for a year.</p><p>I keep going back to this - the Steele dossier. You've - you mentioned the  warrant that they got on Carter Page. That was mainly on the Steele  dossier. The Steele dossier is not about Carter Page, and it's not even  about prostitutes in a - in a Moscow hotel. The theory of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --of the Steele dossier is that Trump and Russia, Trump and the  Kremlin, Trump, personally, and the Kremlin, are in a conspiracy, an  espionage conspiracy to subvert the election, so that Trump can get in and  do Russia's bidding. That was what they went to the FISA Court with in  order to get a warrant on Carter Page.</p><p>So, the theory behind this, if you look at the - the - the Steele dossier,  guys like Page and Manafort and Cohen, they're sort of the emissaries  between the Trump side of the conspiracy and the Kremlin side of the  conspiracy, but the - the whole thing's about Trump, and it was always--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --about Trump. And all that happened in May of 2017 is they went  overt in their files on something that they had been covertly doing for  over a year.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's - that's such a - you are the only one I've heard make  that point. It's a really smart point. Andy McCarthy, thank you very much  for that, over a year, unbelievable.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer, and a whistleblower, who  knows the federal government very well through hard experience. John,  thanks very much for coming on tonight. Does this--</p><p>JOHN CHRIS KIRIAKOU, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CIA OFFICER, READER  SUPPORTED NEWS COLUMNIST, CO-HOST OF LOUD AND CLEAR ON SPUTNIK RADIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --so what - what do you - so, you read that story in The New York  Times on Friday. Tell me if it ratified or contradicted what you already  believed about how government works.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Oh, no, this - this absolutely ratified what I believed about  government. First of all, Andrew McCarthy is exactly right. This is what  the FBI does. And it predates 9 - 2017 by at least a year. </p><p>Don't forget, Tucker, that the CIA has a Counterintelligence Center that  works very, very closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. </p><p>So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim  Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We  should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian  spy.\"</p><p>The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s. They did it to Martin  Luther King in the 60s, to George McGovern in '72. If they don't like you,  they call you a communist or they call you a Russian dupe, and then they  let the propaganda and the press takeover.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean why would Liberals, of all people, stand by and allow that  to happen? Isn't - I mean this - wasn't this their Fever Dream that some  unaccountable cabal of bureaucrats in the national security state would  subvert democracy? Why aren't they saying something about this?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Because they hate Donald Trump that much. They don't like the  man. They don't like his policies. And they see the only way or the best  way to unseat him as using what's - what we call the Deep State.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, what does this mean for future presidents? I mean if - if  Kamala Harris or just pick a - pick a candidate, gets elected next time, or  the time after that, I mean can any President really believe that his or  her bureaucracy won't try to end the presidency?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: No. I - I think that's exactly what the problem is. And what we  need here is robust Congressional oversight, which we haven't had in  decades.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: It should - it should be up to the - the Senate and House  Judiciary Committees to put a stop to this kind of nonsense before it even  - it even forms its - its own life. It - they could have smothered it in--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: --the crib and they didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: They're cheering it on.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: John, thank you. It's great to see you, always.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: My pleasure, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the government shutdown continues. Americans bore - America's  border remains a mess, obviously. MS-13 gang members, using a legal  loophole to stay within this country's borders. That's next. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: HUNTING MS-13.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well a vicious MS-13 attack in New York is being blamed on  America's gaping immigration loopholes. Ramon Arevalo Lopez and Oscar  Canales Molina allegedly took part in an MS-13 assault on two New York High  School students.</p><p>Both of the alleged assailants were detained at the border in 2016. But  since they were unaccompanied minors at the time, they were allowed to  settle in this country, while awaiting deportation. </p><p>Of course, they were never deported. Nobody ever is. Without that catch and  release policy, the crime likely wouldn't have happened.</p><p>Mark Morgan was Head of the Border Patrol under President Obama. He was  dismissed by President Trump, which you should keep in mind as you listen  to him speak, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for  coming on tonight.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF, FORMER FBI AGENT: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is it too much to say that this is a real-world example of  what can happen if you have a dysfunctional immigration policy?</p><p>MORGAN: That's absolutely right, Tucker. And I think you said it right is  that it's about that the immigration process in this country across the  board is broke. This is a great example--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MORGAN: --American, you know, if they could look this up, the Flores  decision. The Flores decision is what mandates the United States Border  Patrol to release minor children. They only have a few amount of days. </p><p>And once they hit that, they've got to release them, regardless if they've  been properly vetted, regardless if they have a - a parent in the United  States, they have to be released into the interior United States.</p><p>CARLSON: And so, that's a judicial ruling. A - a court came up with that  decision. Could - has Congress ever acted on it? I mean, since clearly  that's crazy, why doesn't the United States Congress fix it?</p><p>MORGAN: That's a great question, Tucker, another reason why I'm breaking my  silence, because Congress could fix this in five minutes if they wanted to.  Before I was a Chief of Border Patrol, I was with the - with - with the  FBI, and I actually--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN: --supervised MS-13 Gang Force in Southern California. We used to  catch them on surveillance wires, and they would laugh. MS-13 gang members  would laugh how easy it was to go back and forth between the - the Mexico  and U.S. border.</p><p>CARLSON: So, we've had a number of debates on this show with Democrats who  say there's something bigoted about criticizing MS-13. As someone who's  actually worked to apprehend MS-13, how would you respond to that?</p><p>MORGAN: That's ridiculous. MS-13, and - and I know this may be  controversial. But when the - when the President referred to them as  animals, I - I absolutely said, \"That is correct,\" those MS-13 members.</p><p>And I can tell you, again, because I've worked it, and I've been there as a  Chief, I've been to the detention facilities where I've walked up to these  individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at  them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said, \"That is a soon- to-be MS-13 gang member.\" It's unequivocal.</p><p>CARLSON: And their - their - their victims are overwhelmingly immigrants  themselves, right?</p><p>MORGAN: That's - that's another untold story, Tucker, that I'm glad you're  talking about tonight. That's absolutely correct. That's another  incredulous thing. They absolutely prey on their own.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So if you - if you cared, you would care about that. Mr.  Morgan, thank you very much. Mark Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well California has been staying up late thinking of new ways to  make life harder for normal people, the ones who haven't moved to Idaho  yet. We'll tell you what they're doing after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many  consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because  the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that?</p><p>Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the  GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly  Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do  it?</p><p>And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's  really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal  immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who  are already here illegally.</p><p>Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They  agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a  political matter? It's worth thinking about that. </p><p>A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration  is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter  enforcement of America's immigration laws.</p><p>According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of  American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter  believe America has too many immigrants already. </p><p>And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious.  These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from  future waves of lower-skilled immigrants.</p><p>So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the  Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise  their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for  that, passionately.</p><p>One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is  better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than  having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that  question of about 60 percent.</p><p>Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic  mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the  national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political  terms.</p><p>Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to  raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That  means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home  raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it.</p><p>So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of  overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want  most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at  home? </p><p>19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares?  Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should  have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for  once?</p><p>Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids  their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all  colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make  this a happier country.</p><p>Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live,  really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by  the day. What's happening?</p><p>Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, how about a new water tax,  Tucker? Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't said what the new water tax would cost  California residents. But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry  Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month.</p><p>That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature.  Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean  drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the  Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary  because the state has many alternate funding solutions.</p><p>And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the  proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a  new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" </p><p>Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper  receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to  make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer  specifically wants one. </p><p>Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by  the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the  businesses. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That'll work. Trace Gallagher, great to see you.</p><p>GALLAGHER: You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn, joins us tonight. You know,  sometimes Mark, you hear an idea that's so brilliant, it's a transformative  idea.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like when Galileo got back from stargazing and hit you  with it, you know, I can't (ph) make sense. </p><p>I was walking down Market Street today, in fact, in San Francisco, and  there are people passed out, and there's human feces all over the sidewalk,  and it occurred to me, if only they would ban paper receipts, maybe all of  this would be better.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. I - I think so. As Trace was saying, they - this - these paper  receipts con - contain a chemical called BPA, which if you eat it, in high  quantities, can call birth - could cause birth defects. </p><p>And clearly, that's why California last year had the lowest fertility rate  in its entire history because people aren't having any bar - births because  they're eating too many receipts.</p><p>If you go to a Beverly Hills restaurant, and the waiter says, \"Do you want  the curly endive salad,\" and the lady says, \"No, I'll just have the receipt  and a glass of water. Oh, no wait. I can't afford the tax on the water.  Just bring me the receipt.\"</p><p>I - I had a 40-receipt a day habit. I used to buy packs of cigarettes just  so I could eat the receipts. But I actually think - I actually think,  Tucker, there's a serious point in this. The beneficiary of this would be  the Twitter guy who also makes--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --these little square machines that you see which issue the  electronic receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And if you think about it, Tucker, just as social media has meant  that news and information and knowledge is just in the hands of four or  five companies around the world now, imagine if actual money just came  under the control of the same four or five people who control social media? </p><p>I'd rather have a paper receipt than the Twitter guy controlling receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Well OK, so but that's not actually--</p><p>STEYN: I have not that thing (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --a crazy thing to say because there are, as you know, proposals  every year to do--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --away with paper money and to make everything paperless.</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why, you know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --at a time when big tech has shown no respect for the First  Amendment, for freedom of association, really, any right at all where they  - they ape Communist China, why would we trust them to control all of our  commercial transactions?</p><p>STEYN: Because I think the same that there is now a generation of people  who think this is entirely normal. I mean I don't - I don't want to go all,  you know, electromagnetic pulse on you. </p><p>But one of the problems with that is if - if that ever does happen, we'll  be going back to the mid-19th Century, but with a population that no longer  knows what people knew in the mid-19th Century, including that it sometimes  helps to be able to have paper receipts. </p><p>It sometimes helps not to deliver more and more of the daily functioning of  the world into the same four or five companies.</p><p>CARLSON: That's so - I actually hadn't put those - those together, but I  should have. That's why we're always so grateful to have you on, Mark  Steyn, a genius.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>So, the latest FBI revelations, Friday, in The New York Times, we learned  that the bureau did not agree with the President's policy positions on  Russia, and so they accused him internally of being a spy for Russia. Hmm?  Are the Democrats OK with that? We'll ask one after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: People doing that investigation were people that have been caught  that are known scoundrels. They're in my - I guess you could say, they're  dirty cops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was the President today responding to the story on Friday  that the FBI tried to investigate him as a foreign spy. That happened. No  one contested (ph) it did. How is the Democratic Party viewing this  development? </p><p>Joining us tonight is Richard Goodstein. He's a lawyer. He advised both  Bill and Hillary Clinton. Richard, good to see you tonight.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Thanks for having me. Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the core of The New York Times story. The officials at  the FBI watched the President on the campaign trail in 2016. </p><p>And they watched him say, and I'm quoting now from a press conference, July  26th, I believe, 2016, in Florida, \"There's nothing I'd rather do than have  a Russia - than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right  now. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example,  Russia, I'm all for it.\"</p><p>So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and  they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you  say?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's where I think you and most Democrats disagree. As Dick  Cheney said, what the Russians did in the 2016 elections was an act of war.  This was unprecedented. You talked in your opening monologue today about  what was unprecedented about this investigation of Donald Trump.</p><p>We could spend the rest of this show, not just this segment, listing all  the things that he's done, siding with Putin in Helsinki against our  intelligence agencies.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That's unprecedented. The list--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So but wait, let me--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --goes on.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you. So, there's no question that he has a different  view from the neocon establishment in Washington, the ones that have  destroyed our country and the world, and have never gone to prison,  unfortunately, as a result of what they did. </p><p>So, he is different. There's no doubt about that. But I'm just wondering as  a kind of factual matter, is there something wrong, if I were to say on the  air, you know, I kind of - I kind of like Russia, or, you know, I think  they're a lot better than China, would that make my loyalty to America  suspect? Would that--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But that--</p><p>CARLSON: --qualify me for an FBI investigation, would it?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. But if you were a--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --presidential candidate and said to the public, to the  Russians, please steal from Hillary Clinton, please steal from her, that  would actually, and then, you actually knew as the intelligence agencies--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that the Russians were stealing from her and that Trump--</p><p>CARLSON: When did--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --was using it a hundreds of times--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and we'd actually don't know what else these intercepts of--</p><p>CARLSON: We don't - we don't know. We don't know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --we don't know. We will.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But we do know - let me ask you this, do you think that it's  within bounds for the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world to  see a politician they don't like open an investigation into whether he  committed treason, discover that he did not commit treason, file no charges  against him, and then leak the existence of that investigation to the  press?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that's - that's - that's an OK way to conduct  business within an Executive Branch? Are you comfortable with that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well the predicate is that we - he didn't commit treason, which  is siding - aiding and abetting your enemy. Actually, I think on the public  record, we know that he kind of has, whether that rises to the level of  anybody in Congress or the public--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look, you don't agree - no, but hold on - I'm talking about  the law enforcement. Look, you don't agree with Trump, you don't agree with  his Russia policy, I think that's fine. I have no interest in seeing the  FBI open an investigation into you for disagreeing with me because I'm not  a fascist. </p><p>But I'm just wondering if you think it's OK for a law enforcement agency to  investigate a politician whose views they disagree with, find no chargeable  evidence, and then leak the fact they investigated him, in order to  discredit him, are you comfortable with that standard? That's all I'm  asking</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, we - we don't know that they haven't found  chargeable evidence, one. We - until Mueller has his report--</p><p>CARLSON: Why don't they charge him?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well - well let's see what Mueller has to say, which--</p><p>CARLSON: This isn't Mueller. Wait, hold on. This isn't Mueller. He's  running a separate investigation--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: He picked it (ph) up.</p><p>CARLSON: --which is an independent--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: We actually (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's - independent for Mueller. This was the FBI. Did they - if  they didn't find anything, is it OK even if they did find something,  shouldn't we learn about it in the filing of charges, like is it OK to  discredit politicians using a law enforcement agency? Is that - is that  cool with you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well when you say filing of charges, I - I - I tend to agree, I  think, with you that probably prosecuting a sitting President is not  something that's considered appropriate. That's what impeachment's for.</p><p>So again, your predicate for your - your kind of assertion about misconduct  by the FBI is something I just don't, and I think most Democrats, and most  of the public, doesn't subscribe to, which is the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so - so it's OK? I just want to know like what's the standard  going forward? So, President Harris three years from now will have views  that I don't agree with. If I see the FBI investigate her for having those  views--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if she is consorting--</p><p>CARLSON: --for being too close to Uzbekistan or whatever--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but they don't charge her but then they leak that they thought  maybe she was a quisling, that's totally fine. It's not a big deal.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if Uzbekistan had the way to change the United States  elections, and she consorted with them, and her son did, and her son-in-law  did, and other - and her Campaign Chairman was an aide to the Uzbekistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --government, yes, and - and actually change the platform of the  Democratic Party--</p><p>CARLSON: Change the platform?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to - to help the Uzbekistan, yes, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's OK--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they - they might (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. It's OK - can I just ask (ph) one last question. Is it  - do you think it's moral for the - for me as a parent, for example, to  say, I don't think that my son should fight for the territorial integrity  of Ukraine, or am I somehow working for Putin, if I think that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, Tucker, people have different views as to what's the  standard by which their people - their - their flesh and blood should be  committed to the defense of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But so - so--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Some people in (ph) the military--</p><p>CARLSON: --why should I care? Why should I care about--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why we should care if the--</p><p>CARLSON: --whether Russia invades Ukraine? I mean I'm not against--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why.</p><p>CARLSON: --Ukraine. I'm just saying like why - I'm an American. Why do I  care?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why. Be - because if you--</p><p>CARLSON: Remind me.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --if you look at the Russian press, I think they're coming to  believe that Donald Trump is, sorry, a stooge and, therefore, they can get  away with things in Ukraine in--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but why do I care, just super quick--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --right in Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell me why I care if they take over Ukraine? I'm not - I'm not- -</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Be - because and that's testing with (ph) Europe and--</p><p>CARLSON: --calling for invasion of Ukraine but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, again, you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so they're going to - they're going to invade Liechtenstein  next like this is not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, it's not Liechtenstein, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: --settling, you can (ph) hear yourself?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I think they're trying to - we - we know that they're meddling  in Brexit--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and these elections in France and elsewhere. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, they're (ph) invading England. OK, OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're doing it.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Richard, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, see you.</p><p>CARLSON: We're still waiting breathlessly, of course, for the release of  the Mueller report. For some, the final import (ph) is anticipated like The  Rapture, a religious event that will expose and destroy the Incubus that is  Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, BUSINESSPERSON, AUTHOR, HOST OF THE WGBH PODCAST THE SCIF,  CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I personally think that what Mueller is  heading to, is not only the indictments, because remember, there maybe  more, right.</p><p>He's not going to, you know, he's going to, there - there may be more  coming down the pike.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, JOURNALIST, CNN TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p>KAYYEM: But also a report that discloses the extent to which Trump and his  family are compromised by the Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Compromised! How do I get to be a CNN analyst? Low bar, obviously. </p><p>Others though are more cautious that one - Mueller's report could be a  disappointment in the end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: People who are  closest to - to what Mueller has been doing of, interacting with the  Special Counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti- climactic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr is a former Independent Counsel, of course. He's the  Author of the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation, and he  joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on, Judge. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES  CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure which I'm rooting for, the anti-climactic version  of the report or the report that actually answers the questions  outstanding. </p><p>But if it turns out the report does not find the President colluded with  Russia, and goes in another direction, shouldn't Mueller offer some kind of  apology for gumming up the wheels of government for two years and  destroying public - I'm serious, and destroying public confidence--</p><p>STARR: No, I know you are. I know you are, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --in every institution this country has?</p><p>STARR: I - I understand, Tucker. I have a different view. And that view is  that Mueller should bring this to a close. We've needed to know the answer  about collusion for a long time. And I think he knows that answer. </p><p>And I wish we would know that pretty darn soon because that goes to the  heart of American politics etcetera several roles (ph) our relationships  with Russia. But here's why I'm not subscribing to the anti-Mueller view.</p><p>All of the Republican leadership agrees, \"Let him finish his work.\" Bill  Barr, the nominee, and who's superbly qualified is not - now saying, \"Let  him finish his work.\" And that's what I want him to do. Now--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --I will say this in addition (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But let me just say, there's no group I respect less.</p><p>STARR: Those--</p><p>CARLSON: So, that holds no water with me. I'm just wondering, as an  American, why wouldn't the interest of the country--</p><p>STARR: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --come before all of this stuff like well - how are we benefiting  from this--</p><p>STARR: I couldn't--</p><p>CARLSON: --protracted investigation?</p><p>STARR: Because Bob Mueller has been finding stuff that needed to be found  out, specifically the 13 Russian individuals and the two organizations.  You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a  very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an  indictment.</p><p>But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't  have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second  indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the  Trump Administration.</p><p>So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was  interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian  individuals, because of - of interference. </p><p>Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a  report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is,  you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people  in reports. </p><p>You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you  don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: And that's the regulation. Listen, one of the many problems, as you  know, the Independent Counsel Law under which I served is it called for  this vast report to do what? To go to the House of Representatives for  purposes of impeachment. Let's get the Justice Department out of that  business entirely.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I would say that. The deal (ph)--</p><p>STARR: House Representatives--</p><p>CARLSON: --that - right. Just leaking against people they don't like,  little, little scary, I would think.</p><p>STARR: Oh, that is terrible. In fact--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: --let me comment on that, if I may, very briefly. When--</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly, if you would, yes.</p><p>STARR: --when I read The New York Times article, my first reaction was we  need an investigation right now as to who leaked this. We think we know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: What was their motivation, and why the timing? This was many months  ago. There's been--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --no suggestion whatsoever of - to support this outrageous charge  against the President.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. It's pretty scary. Ken Starr, thank you very much.</p><p>STARR: My pleasure, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is running for president as a Democrat.  Some of her foreign policy views diverge from those of official Washington,  so they're trying to destroy and defame her.</p><p>Huh! Interesting! We've got details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: It's been close to two months now. But the Yellow Jacket - Yellow  Vests, rather, protests in France are still going on. In some ways, they're  getting bigger. They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight  global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras.</p><p>The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed  about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think  global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. </p><p>Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to  impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in  Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a  scam. Let's just be honest about it.  Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they  actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal  of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. </p><p>This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its  own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in  city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. </p><p>Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for  the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their  governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as  their top priority. </p><p>America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country  are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa,  screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why  not knock over a speed camera or two?</p><p>Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you  might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight  the system. They fight to preserve it.</p><p>Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced  that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been  savaged by the Left.</p><p>Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of  Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that  country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage  in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other  major Democrat opposed gay marriage.</p><p>So, what is this really about?</p><p>Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about.  He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a  defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. </p><p>But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to  be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?</p><p>GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT CO-FOUNDER, LAWYER, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: So,  yes, I'm not a - a - a supporter of Congresswoman Gabbard's candidacy.  There are some really legitimate and serious concerns that I have that have  been raised by the real Left, not the Democratic Party Liberals--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --about some of her support for the war on terror, her - her -  her affinity for Hindu nationalism in India, her affection for some really  terrible dictators that I think she should answer for, and be - be clear  about. </p><p>But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she  resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie  Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then  supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that.</p><p>But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington  orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we  continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria,  and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we  do in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington  Consensus. She's hard to put into a Liberal or a Conservative or a Right- wing or a Left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the  most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers.</p><p>CARLSON: But there's something so stealthy and feline and dishonest about  the way they're attacking her. If you don't like her foreign policy views,  then let's just say so. But no one ever really wants to debate what our  foreign policy should be. They just attack anybody who deviates from their  own dumb ideas. Have you noticed this?</p><p>GREENWALD: Yes. Well so, I think there's one particular smear that has  become extremely pervasive in U.S. discourse that is central to sustaining  the United States as a country that's at endless war, which is if you don't  support a particular war that Washington wants, to remove a particular  leader, you get accused of being a supporter of that Dictator.</p><p>In 2002 and '03--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --people who were against the Iraq War were accused often on  this network but others as well--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, sure.</p><p>GREENWALD: --ridiculously accused of - of - of loving Saddam Hussein.  People who - who opposed the intervention in Libya in 2011 were accused of  being apologists for Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p>And now, Tulsi Gabbard is being accused of being a supporter of someone  that she actually called a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, because she's  asking why it is that we are spending a billion dollars a year, or were  arming rebels, who we don't know, trying to remove the leader of a foreign  country, and engaging in all kinds of policies that are actually worsening  the security of the United States rather than helping them.</p><p>You can criticize her. But to accuse her of being a supporter of - or a  best friend of, as Claire McCaskill put it, Bashar al-Assad is just  idiotic, but it's really toxic as well because it's the kind of argument--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GREENWALD: --hauled out always to defend Washington foreign policy.</p><p>CARLSON: It's the kind of argument that ends the argument, and that's the  point. Glenn Greenwald, thank you always for your incisive views on that.</p><p>GREENWALD: Good to be here, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back, have no fear, tomorrow  night, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity,  smugness, and groupthink. We hope you'll join us then. </p><p>Have a great evening, meantime. Guess who's next? You guessed it. And we're  going to throw to him nine seconds early, Sean Hannity. He's standing by in  New York.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: This has become an issue. People say how many seconds  extra did Tucker steal from your show? Now - good to see. Great show as  always.</p><p>CARLSON: It's an act of love, Sean. Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: Greenwald's an interesting guy. I like that.</p><p>CARLSON: He is an interesting guy. He's an honest man.</p><p>HANNITY: Very interesting.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: A whole debate about what is described as media because we know  the networks, the newspapers, and cable channels are fake news, and have  agendas, never (ph) people that are, you know, non-political that I'm  interested in.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, me too. </p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker. Thank you. Welcome to Hannity.</p><p>CARLSON: Still believe it (ph).</p><p>END </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether the President is in fact a Russian agent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the President of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without precedent. That is not overstatement.</p><p>And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him. None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did this happen?</p><p>Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing.</p><p>All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story, we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln Bedroom, no. Think again.</p><p>There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public, standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's nothing I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's their view.</p><p>But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right. Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's (ph) on the other side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States. It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten our key allies like Japan or Great Britain.</p><p>Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin?</p><p>And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very many people, it turns out.</p><p>So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ROBERT WARNER, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump. You had Trump say only nice things about Putin. He never spoke ill about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our enemies.</p><p>So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer.</p><p>Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.</p><p>Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent from their agenda. That's what this is.</p><p>And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so those agencies try to put him in jail.</p><p>It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to, \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread our democratic ideals.\"</p><p>So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No wonder Max Boot is on board with this.</p><p>Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too. They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.</p><p>No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that. The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak (ph) crickets. Whatever!</p><p>The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on. They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline. Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well Kristy (ph), the President's tweet trying to make the case that he's not a Russian asset really just undercuts his own defense. The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was written by Putin himself.</p><p>Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission.</p><p>Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just making Russia's job easier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: You say you're not a Russian agent, therefore, you're a Russian agent. Who puts these people on TV? That's a question we should think about.</p><p>Over the weekend, speaking of television, CNN President Jeff Zucker declared that anyone who isn't spreading fear of Russia is doing the bidding of Russia. Now, Zucker didn't say that himself, of course. He rarely speaks in public. Instead, he sent his marionette out, as he often does, to deliver the message.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN'S RELIABLE SOURCES HOST, FORMER MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, FORMER TVNEWSER EDITOR: I was watching Good Morning America this weekend. And both mornings, they led with snowstorms and scares at malls and other stories, and not this.</p><p>And I - I just keep wondering if - if the public is ill-served, if we don't make it really clear what the stakes of this story are. How - how can a morning show not lead with this drama, I guess is what I'm saying.</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: I think - I think plenty of times we lead with - with this drama.</p><p>STELTER: OK. Well, I agree.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: And - and - and with--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So the eunuch (ph) heads to the steps of the palace and reads the proclamation. Message received, thank you very much.</p><p>But take three steps back. Is the media's problem really that it doesn't talk about Russia enough? Doesn't seem like that's the problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the President was working for Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CHARLES CUOMO, TELEVISION JOURNALIST, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Whether the President was secretly working with Russia against America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of the Russians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whether President Trump was working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working on Russia's behalf.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the sitting President was secretly working for Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working for Russia from The Oval Office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes, it's the DNC. You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise, Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is, does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is doing the bidding of Russia?</p><p>I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive foreign wars.</p><p>You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say, Syria and Libya?</p><p>You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S. to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.</p><p>Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S. would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state. Their economy is dependent on energy.</p><p>But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not.</p><p>Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and gas wells across the nation. Huh!</p><p>Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical transparency.</p><p>Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read by the federal government, on what basis?</p><p>We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it. He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials.</p><p>Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security.</p><p>They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents might embarrass the FBI.</p><p>This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government, bring in some sunlight.</p><p>Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them, and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the people, and not the other way around.</p><p>The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have.</p><p>Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, FORMER ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: No, it's not, Tucker. It's not a - appropriate pretext for the FBI for any investigation.</p><p>And I must say that, you know, listening to your monologue, it occurs to me that, you know, since the Soviet Union fell, it's been the purpose of this government it seems, under administrations of both parties, to treat Russia as if it were England.</p><p>And I remember, you know, the Obama debate with Mitt Romney where, you know, Romney suggested that Russia was a geopolitical, our greatest geopolitical enemy, and Obama mocked him for that. Obama--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --on a - in a conversation with Medvedev, who is basically the cat's paw for Putin, you know, says thinking he's not being heard, you know, as soon as I get by this election, I'll have more flexibility. I - imagine if Trump had said these sorts of things.</p><p>But I - I must say, listening to all that, it - it seems like Trump is the guy who was left without a chair when the music stopped, because all of a sudden, everything that was regular and fine is now, you know, now - now Trump is - I'm sorry, Russia's back to being, you know, I guess we're back in the Cold War.</p><p>And look, I - I think I probably find Russia to be more of a threat than you do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But the FBI is not supposed to be doing policy. That's not their job.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean why was there no - but and there's a lot that we don't know. But from that story, and no one has contested the basic facts that I have seen, officials in the FBI sat down and decided it is unacceptable for an elect - elected leader to come to these policy conclusions therefore, there must be some sinister motive.</p><p>Why did no one in the FBI say, \"Wait a second. This is demonstrably not our job. We're not allowed to do this.\"</p><p>MCCARTHY: Because they didn't start doing it in May 2017. In May 2017, Tucker, all they did was, as a formal paper matter, they opened an investigation, specifically, on Trump. But it was the same investigation that had been being conducted for a year.</p><p>I keep going back to this - the Steele dossier. You've - you mentioned the warrant that they got on Carter Page. That was mainly on the Steele dossier. The Steele dossier is not about Carter Page, and it's not even about prostitutes in a - in a Moscow hotel. The theory of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --of the Steele dossier is that Trump and Russia, Trump and the Kremlin, Trump, personally, and the Kremlin, are in a conspiracy, an espionage conspiracy to subvert the election, so that Trump can get in and do Russia's bidding. That was what they went to the FISA Court with in order to get a warrant on Carter Page.</p><p>So, the theory behind this, if you look at the - the - the Steele dossier, guys like Page and Manafort and Cohen, they're sort of the emissaries between the Trump side of the conspiracy and the Kremlin side of the conspiracy, but the - the whole thing's about Trump, and it was always--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --about Trump. And all that happened in May of 2017 is they went overt in their files on something that they had been covertly doing for over a year.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's - that's such a - you are the only one I've heard make that point. It's a really smart point. Andy McCarthy, thank you very much for that, over a year, unbelievable.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer, and a whistleblower, who knows the federal government very well through hard experience. John, thanks very much for coming on tonight. Does this--</p><p>JOHN CHRIS KIRIAKOU, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CIA OFFICER, READER SUPPORTED NEWS COLUMNIST, CO-HOST OF LOUD AND CLEAR ON SPUTNIK RADIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --so what - what do you - so, you read that story in The New York Times on Friday. Tell me if it ratified or contradicted what you already believed about how government works.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Oh, no, this - this absolutely ratified what I believed about government. First of all, Andrew McCarthy is exactly right. This is what the FBI does. And it predates 9 - 2017 by at least a year.</p><p>Don't forget, Tucker, that the CIA has a Counterintelligence Center that works very, very closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division.</p><p>So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian spy.\"</p><p>The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s. They did it to Martin Luther King in the 60s, to George McGovern in '72. If they don't like you, they call you a communist or they call you a Russian dupe, and then they let the propaganda and the press takeover.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean why would Liberals, of all people, stand by and allow that to happen? Isn't - I mean this - wasn't this their Fever Dream that some unaccountable cabal of bureaucrats in the national security state would subvert democracy? Why aren't they saying something about this?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Because they hate Donald Trump that much. They don't like the man. They don't like his policies. And they see the only way or the best way to unseat him as using what's - what we call the Deep State.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, what does this mean for future presidents? I mean if - if Kamala Harris or just pick a - pick a candidate, gets elected next time, or the time after that, I mean can any President really believe that his or her bureaucracy won't try to end the presidency?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: No. I - I think that's exactly what the problem is. And what we need here is robust Congressional oversight, which we haven't had in decades.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: It should - it should be up to the - the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to put a stop to this kind of nonsense before it even - it even forms its - its own life. It - they could have smothered it in--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: --the crib and they didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: They're cheering it on.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: John, thank you. It's great to see you, always.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: My pleasure, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the government shutdown continues. Americans bore - America's border remains a mess, obviously. MS-13 gang members, using a legal loophole to stay within this country's borders. That's next. Stay tuned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: HUNTING MS-13.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well a vicious MS-13 attack in New York is being blamed on America's gaping immigration loopholes. Ramon Arevalo Lopez and Oscar Canales Molina allegedly took part in an MS-13 assault on two New York High School students.</p><p>Both of the alleged assailants were detained at the border in 2016. But since they were unaccompanied minors at the time, they were allowed to settle in this country, while awaiting deportation.</p><p>Of course, they were never deported. Nobody ever is. Without that catch and release policy, the crime likely wouldn't have happened.</p><p>Mark Morgan was Head of the Border Patrol under President Obama. He was dismissed by President Trump, which you should keep in mind as you listen to him speak, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for coming on tonight.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF, FORMER FBI AGENT: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is it too much to say that this is a real-world example of what can happen if you have a dysfunctional immigration policy?</p><p>MORGAN: That's absolutely right, Tucker. And I think you said it right is that it's about that the immigration process in this country across the board is broke. This is a great example--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MORGAN: --American, you know, if they could look this up, the Flores decision. The Flores decision is what mandates the United States Border Patrol to release minor children. They only have a few amount of days.</p><p>And once they hit that, they've got to release them, regardless if they've been properly vetted, regardless if they have a - a parent in the United States, they have to be released into the interior United States.</p><p>CARLSON: And so, that's a judicial ruling. A - a court came up with that decision. Could - has Congress ever acted on it? I mean, since clearly that's crazy, why doesn't the United States Congress fix it?</p><p>MORGAN: That's a great question, Tucker, another reason why I'm breaking my silence, because Congress could fix this in five minutes if they wanted to. Before I was a Chief of Border Patrol, I was with the - with - with the FBI, and I actually--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN: --supervised MS-13 Gang Force in Southern California. We used to catch them on surveillance wires, and they would laugh. MS-13 gang members would laugh how easy it was to go back and forth between the - the Mexico and U.S. border.</p><p>CARLSON: So, we've had a number of debates on this show with Democrats who say there's something bigoted about criticizing MS-13. As someone who's actually worked to apprehend MS-13, how would you respond to that?</p><p>MORGAN: That's ridiculous. MS-13, and - and I know this may be controversial. But when the - when the President referred to them as animals, I - I absolutely said, \"That is correct,\" those MS-13 members.</p><p>And I can tell you, again, because I've worked it, and I've been there as a Chief, I've been to the detention facilities where I've walked up to these individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said, \"That is a soon- to-be MS-13 gang member.\" It's unequivocal.</p><p>CARLSON: And their - their - their victims are overwhelmingly immigrants themselves, right?</p><p>MORGAN: That's - that's another untold story, Tucker, that I'm glad you're talking about tonight. That's absolutely correct. That's another incredulous thing. They absolutely prey on their own.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So if you - if you cared, you would care about that. Mr. Morgan, thank you very much. Mark Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well California has been staying up late thinking of new ways to make life harder for normal people, the ones who haven't moved to Idaho yet. We'll tell you what they're doing after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that?</p><p>Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do it?</p><p>And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who are already here illegally.</p><p>Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a political matter? It's worth thinking about that.</p><p>A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter enforcement of America's immigration laws.</p><p>According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter believe America has too many immigrants already.</p><p>And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious. These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from future waves of lower-skilled immigrants.</p><p>So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for that, passionately.</p><p>One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that question of about 60 percent.</p><p>Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political terms.</p><p>Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it.</p><p>So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at home?</p><p>19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares? Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for once?</p><p>Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make this a happier country.</p><p>Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live, really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by the day. What's happening?</p><p>Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, how about a new water tax, Tucker? Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't said what the new water tax would cost California residents. But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month.</p><p>That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature. Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary because the state has many alternate funding solutions.</p><p>And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a new tax whenever there is a new problem.\"</p><p>Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer specifically wants one.</p><p>Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the businesses. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That'll work. Trace Gallagher, great to see you.</p><p>GALLAGHER: You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn, joins us tonight. You know, sometimes Mark, you hear an idea that's so brilliant, it's a transformative idea.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like when Galileo got back from stargazing and hit you with it, you know, I can't (ph) make sense.</p><p>I was walking down Market Street today, in fact, in San Francisco, and there are people passed out, and there's human feces all over the sidewalk, and it occurred to me, if only they would ban paper receipts, maybe all of this would be better.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. I - I think so. As Trace was saying, they - this - these paper receipts con - contain a chemical called BPA, which if you eat it, in high quantities, can call birth - could cause birth defects.</p><p>And clearly, that's why California last year had the lowest fertility rate in its entire history because people aren't having any bar - births because they're eating too many receipts.</p><p>If you go to a Beverly Hills restaurant, and the waiter says, \"Do you want the curly endive salad,\" and the lady says, \"No, I'll just have the receipt and a glass of water. Oh, no wait. I can't afford the tax on the water. Just bring me the receipt.\"</p><p>I - I had a 40-receipt a day habit. I used to buy packs of cigarettes just so I could eat the receipts. But I actually think - I actually think, Tucker, there's a serious point in this. The beneficiary of this would be the Twitter guy who also makes--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --these little square machines that you see which issue the electronic receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And if you think about it, Tucker, just as social media has meant that news and information and knowledge is just in the hands of four or five companies around the world now, imagine if actual money just came under the control of the same four or five people who control social media?</p><p>I'd rather have a paper receipt than the Twitter guy controlling receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Well OK, so but that's not actually--</p><p>STEYN: I have not that thing (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --a crazy thing to say because there are, as you know, proposals every year to do--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --away with paper money and to make everything paperless.</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why, you know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --at a time when big tech has shown no respect for the First Amendment, for freedom of association, really, any right at all where they - they ape Communist China, why would we trust them to control all of our commercial transactions?</p><p>STEYN: Because I think the same that there is now a generation of people who think this is entirely normal. I mean I don't - I don't want to go all, you know, electromagnetic pulse on you.</p><p>But one of the problems with that is if - if that ever does happen, we'll be going back to the mid-19th Century, but with a population that no longer knows what people knew in the mid-19th Century, including that it sometimes helps to be able to have paper receipts.</p><p>It sometimes helps not to deliver more and more of the daily functioning of the world into the same four or five companies.</p><p>CARLSON: That's so - I actually hadn't put those - those together, but I should have. That's why we're always so grateful to have you on, Mark Steyn, a genius.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>So, the latest FBI revelations, Friday, in The New York Times, we learned that the bureau did not agree with the President's policy positions on Russia, and so they accused him internally of being a spy for Russia. Hmm? Are the Democrats OK with that? We'll ask one after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: People doing that investigation were people that have been caught that are known scoundrels. They're in my - I guess you could say, they're dirty cops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was the President today responding to the story on Friday that the FBI tried to investigate him as a foreign spy. That happened. No one contested (ph) it did. How is the Democratic Party viewing this development?</p><p>Joining us tonight is Richard Goodstein. He's a lawyer. He advised both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Richard, good to see you tonight.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: Thanks for having me. Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the core of The New York Times story. The officials at the FBI watched the President on the campaign trail in 2016.</p><p>And they watched him say, and I'm quoting now from a press conference, July 26th, I believe, 2016, in Florida, \"There's nothing I'd rather do than have a Russia - than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example, Russia, I'm all for it.\"</p><p>So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you say?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's where I think you and most Democrats disagree. As Dick Cheney said, what the Russians did in the 2016 elections was an act of war. This was unprecedented. You talked in your opening monologue today about what was unprecedented about this investigation of Donald Trump.</p><p>We could spend the rest of this show, not just this segment, listing all the things that he's done, siding with Putin in Helsinki against our intelligence agencies.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That's unprecedented. The list--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So but wait, let me--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --goes on.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you. So, there's no question that he has a different view from the neocon establishment in Washington, the ones that have destroyed our country and the world, and have never gone to prison, unfortunately, as a result of what they did.</p><p>So, he is different. There's no doubt about that. But I'm just wondering as a kind of factual matter, is there something wrong, if I were to say on the air, you know, I kind of - I kind of like Russia, or, you know, I think they're a lot better than China, would that make my loyalty to America suspect? Would that--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But that--</p><p>CARLSON: --qualify me for an FBI investigation, would it?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. But if you were a--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --presidential candidate and said to the public, to the Russians, please steal from Hillary Clinton, please steal from her, that would actually, and then, you actually knew as the intelligence agencies--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that the Russians were stealing from her and that Trump--</p><p>CARLSON: When did--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --was using it a hundreds of times--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and we'd actually don't know what else these intercepts of--</p><p>CARLSON: We don't - we don't know. We don't know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --we don't know. We will.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But we do know - let me ask you this, do you think that it's within bounds for the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world to see a politician they don't like open an investigation into whether he committed treason, discover that he did not commit treason, file no charges against him, and then leak the existence of that investigation to the press?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that's - that's - that's an OK way to conduct business within an Executive Branch? Are you comfortable with that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well the predicate is that we - he didn't commit treason, which is siding - aiding and abetting your enemy. Actually, I think on the public record, we know that he kind of has, whether that rises to the level of anybody in Congress or the public--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look, you don't agree - no, but hold on - I'm talking about the law enforcement. Look, you don't agree with Trump, you don't agree with his Russia policy, I think that's fine. I have no interest in seeing the FBI open an investigation into you for disagreeing with me because I'm not a fascist.</p><p>But I'm just wondering if you think it's OK for a law enforcement agency to investigate a politician whose views they disagree with, find no chargeable evidence, and then leak the fact they investigated him, in order to discredit him, are you comfortable with that standard? That's all I'm asking</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, we - we don't know that they haven't found chargeable evidence, one. We - until Mueller has his report--</p><p>CARLSON: Why don't they charge him?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well - well let's see what Mueller has to say, which--</p><p>CARLSON: This isn't Mueller. Wait, hold on. This isn't Mueller. He's running a separate investigation--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: He picked it (ph) up.</p><p>CARLSON: --which is an independent--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: We actually (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's - independent for Mueller. This was the FBI. Did they - if they didn't find anything, is it OK even if they did find something, shouldn't we learn about it in the filing of charges, like is it OK to discredit politicians using a law enforcement agency? Is that - is that cool with you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well when you say filing of charges, I - I - I tend to agree, I think, with you that probably prosecuting a sitting President is not something that's considered appropriate. That's what impeachment's for.</p><p>So again, your predicate for your - your kind of assertion about misconduct by the FBI is something I just don't, and I think most Democrats, and most of the public, doesn't subscribe to, which is the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so - so it's OK? I just want to know like what's the standard going forward? So, President Harris three years from now will have views that I don't agree with. If I see the FBI investigate her for having those views--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if she is consorting--</p><p>CARLSON: --for being too close to Uzbekistan or whatever--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but they don't charge her but then they leak that they thought maybe she was a quisling, that's totally fine. It's not a big deal.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if Uzbekistan had the way to change the United States elections, and she consorted with them, and her son did, and her son-in-law did, and other - and her Campaign Chairman was an aide to the Uzbekistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --government, yes, and - and actually change the platform of the Democratic Party--</p><p>CARLSON: Change the platform?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to - to help the Uzbekistan, yes, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's OK--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they - they might (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. It's OK - can I just ask (ph) one last question. Is it - do you think it's moral for the - for me as a parent, for example, to say, I don't think that my son should fight for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, or am I somehow working for Putin, if I think that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, Tucker, people have different views as to what's the standard by which their people - their - their flesh and blood should be committed to the defense of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But so - so--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Some people in (ph) the military--</p><p>CARLSON: --why should I care? Why should I care about--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why we should care if the--</p><p>CARLSON: --whether Russia invades Ukraine? I mean I'm not against--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why.</p><p>CARLSON: --Ukraine. I'm just saying like why - I'm an American. Why do I care?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why. Be - because if you--</p><p>CARLSON: Remind me.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --if you look at the Russian press, I think they're coming to believe that Donald Trump is, sorry, a stooge and, therefore, they can get away with things in Ukraine in--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but why do I care, just super quick--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --right in Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell me why I care if they take over Ukraine? I'm not - I'm not- -</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Be - because and that's testing with (ph) Europe and--</p><p>CARLSON: --calling for invasion of Ukraine but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, again, you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so they're going to - they're going to invade Liechtenstein next like this is not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, it's not Liechtenstein, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: --settling, you can (ph) hear yourself?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I think they're trying to - we - we know that they're meddling in Brexit--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and these elections in France and elsewhere. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, they're (ph) invading England. OK, OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're doing it.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Richard, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, see you.</p><p>CARLSON: We're still waiting breathlessly, of course, for the release of the Mueller report. For some, the final import (ph) is anticipated like The Rapture, a religious event that will expose and destroy the Incubus that is Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, BUSINESSPERSON, AUTHOR, HOST OF THE WGBH PODCAST THE SCIF, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I personally think that what Mueller is heading to, is not only the indictments, because remember, there maybe more, right.</p><p>He's not going to, you know, he's going to, there - there may be more coming down the pike.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, JOURNALIST, CNN TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p>KAYYEM: But also a report that discloses the extent to which Trump and his family are compromised by the Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Compromised!

Low bar, obviously.</p><p>Others though are more cautious that one - Mueller's report could be a disappointment in the end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: People who are closest to - to what Mueller has been doing of, interacting with the Special Counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti- climactic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr is a former Independent Counsel, of course. He's the Author of the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on, Judge. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure which I'm rooting for, the anti-climactic version of the report or the report that actually answers the questions outstanding.</p><p>But if it turns out the report does not find the President colluded with Russia, and goes in another direction, shouldn't Mueller offer some kind of apology for gumming up the wheels of government for two years and destroying public - I'm serious, and destroying public confidence--</p><p>STARR: No, I know you are. I know you are, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --in every institution this country has?</p><p>STARR: I - I understand, Tucker. I have a different view. And that view is that Mueller should bring this to a close. We've needed to know the answer about collusion for a long time. And I think he knows that answer.</p><p>And I wish we would know that pretty darn soon because that goes to the heart of American politics etcetera several roles (ph) our relationships with Russia. But here's why I'm not subscribing to the anti-Mueller view.</p><p>All of the Republican leadership agrees, \"Let him finish his work.\" Bill Barr, the nominee, and who's superbly qualified is not - now saying, \"Let him finish his work.\" And that's what I want him to do. Now--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --I will say this in addition (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But let me just say, there's no group I respect less.</p><p>STARR: Those--</p><p>CARLSON: So, that holds no water with me. I'm just wondering, as an American, why wouldn't the interest of the country--</p><p>STARR: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --come before all of this stuff like well - how are we benefiting from this--</p><p>STARR: I couldn't--</p><p>CARLSON: --protracted investigation?</p><p>STARR: Because Bob Mueller has been finding stuff that needed to be found out, specifically the 13 Russian individuals and the two organizations. You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an indictment.</p><p>But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the Trump Administration.</p><p>So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian individuals, because of - of interference.</p><p>Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is, you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people in reports.</p><p>You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: And that's the regulation. Listen, one of the many problems, as you know, the Independent Counsel Law under which I served is it called for this vast report to do what? To go to the House of Representatives for purposes of impeachment. Let's get the Justice Department out of that business entirely.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I would say that. The deal (ph)--</p><p>STARR: House Representatives--</p><p>CARLSON: --that - right. Just leaking against people they don't like, little, little scary, I would think.</p><p>STARR: Oh, that is terrible. In fact--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: --let me comment on that, if I may, very briefly. When--</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly, if you would, yes.</p><p>STARR: --when I read The New York Times article, my first reaction was we need an investigation right now as to who leaked this. We think we know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: What was their motivation, and why the timing? This was many months ago. There's been--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --no suggestion whatsoever of - to support this outrageous charge against the President.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. It's pretty scary. Ken Starr, thank you very much.</p><p>STARR: My pleasure, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is running for president as a Democrat. Some of her foreign policy views diverge from those of official Washington, so they're trying to destroy and defame her.</p><p>Huh! Interesting! We've got details after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: It's been close to two months now. But the Yellow Jacket - Yellow Vests, rather, protests in France are still going on. In some ways, they're getting bigger. They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras.</p><p>The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are.</p><p>Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a scam. Let's just be honest about it. Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal of cameras is not to help you but to take your money.</p><p>This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected.</p><p>Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as their top priority.</p><p>America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa, screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why not knock over a speed camera or two?</p><p>Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight the system. They fight to preserve it.</p><p>Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been savaged by the Left.</p><p>Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other major Democrat opposed gay marriage.</p><p>So, what is this really about?</p><p>Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about. He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever.</p><p>But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?</p><p>GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT CO-FOUNDER, LAWYER, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: So, yes, I'm not a - a - a supporter of Congresswoman Gabbard's candidacy. There are some really legitimate and serious concerns that I have that have been raised by the real Left, not the Democratic Party Liberals--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --about some of her support for the war on terror, her - her - her affinity for Hindu nationalism in India, her affection for some really terrible dictators that I think she should answer for, and be - be clear about.</p><p>But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that.</p><p>But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria, and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we do in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington Consensus. She's hard to put into a Liberal or a Conservative or a Right- wing or a Left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers.</p><p>CARLSON: But there's something so stealthy and feline and dishonest about the way they're attacking her. If you don't like her foreign policy views, then let's just say so. But no one ever really wants to debate what our foreign policy should be. They just attack anybody who deviates from their own dumb ideas. Have you noticed this?</p><p>GREENWALD: Yes. Well so, I think there's one particular smear that has become extremely pervasive in U.S. discourse that is central to sustaining the United States as a country that's at endless war, which is if you don't support a particular war that Washington wants, to remove a particular leader, you get accused of being a supporter of that Dictator.</p><p>In 2002 and '03--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --people who were against the Iraq War were accused often on this network but others as well--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, sure.</p><p>GREENWALD: --ridiculously accused of - of - of loving Saddam Hussein. People who - who opposed the intervention in Libya in 2011 were accused of being apologists for Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p>And now, Tulsi Gabbard is being accused of being a supporter of someone that she actually called a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, because she's asking why it is that we are spending a billion dollars a year, or were arming rebels, who we don't know, trying to remove the leader of a foreign country, and engaging in all kinds of policies that are actually worsening the security of the United States rather than helping them.</p><p>You can criticize her. But to accuse her of being a supporter of - or a best friend of, as Claire McCaskill put it, Bashar al-Assad is just idiotic, but it's really toxic as well because it's the kind of argument--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GREENWALD: --hauled out always to defend Washington foreign policy.</p><p>CARLSON: It's the kind of argument that ends the argument, and that's the point. Glenn Greenwald, thank you always for your incisive views on that.</p><p>GREENWALD: Good to be here, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back, have no fear, tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. We hope you'll join us then.</p><p>Have a great evening, meantime. Guess who's next? You guessed it. And we're going to throw to him nine seconds early, Sean Hannity. He's standing by in New York.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: This has become an issue. People say how many seconds extra did Tucker steal from your show? Now - good to see. Great show as always.</p><p>CARLSON: It's an act of love, Sean. Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: Greenwald's an interesting guy. I like that.</p><p>CARLSON: He is an interesting guy. He's an honest man.</p><p>HANNITY: Very interesting.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: A whole debate about what is described as media because we know the networks, the newspapers, and cable channels are fake news, and have agendas, never (ph) people that are, you know, non-political that I'm interested in.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, me too.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker. Thank you. Welcome to Hannity.</p><p>CARLSON: Still believe it (ph).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that  broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it  then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department  of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether  the President is in fact a Russian agent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper  cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and  working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said  they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the  President of the United States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this  has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without  precedent. That is not overstatement.</p><p>And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that  Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him.  None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did  this happen?</p><p>Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not  a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation  and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels  of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing. </p><p>All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would  need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story,  we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret  transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln  Bedroom, no. Think again.</p><p>There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI  assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything  he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public,  standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of  them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's nothing I can  think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way  they are right now.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia?  I'm all for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in  Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you  just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's  their view.</p><p>But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right.  Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's (ph) on the other  side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States.  It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten  our key allies like Japan or Great Britain.</p><p>Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with  Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting  a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin? </p><p>And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the  territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is  very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very  many people, it turns out. </p><p>So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In  Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ROBERT WARNER, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRATIC  PARTY MEMBER, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR OF THE  SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Vladimir Putin policies almost being  parroted by Donald Trump. You had Trump say only nice things about Putin.  He never spoke ill about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States  Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our  enemies. </p><p>So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if  he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with  prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have  spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer.</p><p>Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional  dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian  spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political  positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.</p><p>Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and  this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the  permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent  from their agenda. That's what this is.</p><p>And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd  know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader  gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so  those agencies try to put him in jail.</p><p>It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former  FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking  in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous  country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to,  \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread  our democratic ideals.\"</p><p>So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most  important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all  costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No  wonder Max Boot is on board with this.</p><p>Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too.  They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly  reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause  brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.</p><p>No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly  Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have  determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that.  The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian  crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak (ph) crickets. Whatever!</p><p>The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on.  They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline.  Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying  that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: Well Kristy (ph), the President's tweet trying to make  the case that he's not a Russian asset really just undercuts his own  defense. The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was  written by Putin himself. </p><p>Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting  past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their  actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission. </p><p>Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly  what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just  making Russia's job easier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: You say you're not a Russian agent, therefore, you're a Russian  agent. Who puts these people on TV? That's a question we should think  about. </p><p>Over the weekend, speaking of television, CNN President Jeff Zucker  declared that anyone who isn't spreading fear of Russia is doing the  bidding of Russia. Now, Zucker didn't say that himself, of course. He  rarely speaks in public. Instead, he sent his marionette out, as he often  does, to deliver the message.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN'S RELIABLE  SOURCES HOST, FORMER MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, FORMER TVNEWSER  EDITOR: I was watching Good Morning America this weekend. And both  mornings, they led with snowstorms and scares at malls and other stories,  and not this. </p><p>And I - I just keep wondering if - if the public is ill-served, if we don't  make it really clear what the stakes of this story are. How - how can a  morning show not lead with this drama, I guess is what I'm saying.</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: I think - I think plenty  of times we lead with - with this drama.</p><p>STELTER: OK. Well, I agree.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: And - and - and with--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So the eunuch (ph) heads to the steps of the palace and reads the  proclamation. Message received, thank you very much.</p><p>But take three steps back. Is the media's problem really that it doesn't  talk about Russia enough? Doesn't seem like that's the problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the President was working for Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was secretly working on behalf  of Russia.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CHARLES CUOMO, TELEVISION JOURNALIST, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Whether  the President was secretly working with Russia against America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of the  Russians.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whether President Trump was working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working on Russia's behalf.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the sitting President was secretly working for  Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working for Russia from The  Oval Office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes,  it's the DNC.  You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise,  Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is,  does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is  doing the bidding of Russia? </p><p>I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's  say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American  interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive  foreign wars. </p><p>You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made  America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say,  Syria and Libya? </p><p>You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S.  to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American  government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the  name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.</p><p>Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S.  would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state.  Their economy is dependent on energy.</p><p>But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done  just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my  lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil  and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not.</p><p>Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones  pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and  gas wells across the nation. Huh! </p><p>Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so  many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the  task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical  transparency.</p><p>Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of  Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly  didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read  by the federal government, on what basis? </p><p>We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it.  He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the  Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa  Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials.</p><p>Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for  reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And  we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the  reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. </p><p>They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New  York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information  when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents  might embarrass the FBI.</p><p>This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this  country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of  federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government,  bring in some sunlight. </p><p>Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them,  and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected  leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the  people, and not the other way around.</p><p>The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his  own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him  a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have.</p><p>Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  of New York, and he joins us tonight. </p><p>Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The  Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like  FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an  appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, FORMER ASSISTANT  UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: No, it's not,  Tucker. It's not a - appropriate pretext for the FBI for any investigation. </p><p>And I must say that, you know, listening to your monologue, it occurs to me  that, you know, since the Soviet Union fell, it's been the purpose of this  government it seems, under administrations of both parties, to treat Russia  as if it were England.</p><p>And I remember, you know, the Obama debate with Mitt Romney where, you  know, Romney suggested that Russia was a geopolitical, our greatest  geopolitical enemy, and Obama mocked him for that. Obama--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --on a - in a conversation with Medvedev, who is basically the  cat's paw for Putin, you know, says thinking he's not being heard, you  know, as soon as I get by this election, I'll have more flexibility. I -  imagine if Trump had said these sorts of things.</p><p>But I - I must say, listening to all that, it - it seems like Trump is the  guy who was left without a chair when the music stopped, because all of a  sudden, everything that was regular and fine is now, you know, now - now  Trump is - I'm sorry, Russia's back to being, you know, I guess we're back  in the Cold War.</p><p>And look, I - I think I probably find Russia to be more of a threat than  you do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But the FBI is not supposed to be doing policy. That's not their  job.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean why was there no - but and there's a lot that we don't  know. But from that story, and no one has contested the basic facts that I  have seen, officials in the FBI sat down and decided it is unacceptable for  an elect - elected leader to come to these policy conclusions therefore,  there must be some sinister motive. </p><p>Why did no one in the FBI say, \"Wait a second. This is demonstrably not our  job. We're not allowed to do this.\"</p><p>MCCARTHY: Because they didn't start doing it in May 2017. In May 2017,  Tucker, all they did was, as a formal paper matter, they opened an  investigation, specifically, on Trump. But it was the same investigation  that had been being conducted for a year.</p><p>I keep going back to this - the Steele dossier. You've - you mentioned the  warrant that they got on Carter Page. That was mainly on the Steele  dossier. The Steele dossier is not about Carter Page, and it's not even  about prostitutes in a - in a Moscow hotel. The theory of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --of the Steele dossier is that Trump and Russia, Trump and the  Kremlin, Trump, personally, and the Kremlin, are in a conspiracy, an  espionage conspiracy to subvert the election, so that Trump can get in and  do Russia's bidding. That was what they went to the FISA Court with in  order to get a warrant on Carter Page.</p><p>So, the theory behind this, if you look at the - the - the Steele dossier,  guys like Page and Manafort and Cohen, they're sort of the emissaries  between the Trump side of the conspiracy and the Kremlin side of the  conspiracy, but the - the whole thing's about Trump, and it was always--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MCCARTHY: --about Trump. And all that happened in May of 2017 is they went  overt in their files on something that they had been covertly doing for  over a year.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's - that's such a - you are the only one I've heard make  that point. It's a really smart point. Andy McCarthy, thank you very much  for that, over a year, unbelievable.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer, and a whistleblower, who  knows the federal government very well through hard experience. John,  thanks very much for coming on tonight. Does this--</p><p>JOHN CHRIS KIRIAKOU, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CIA OFFICER, READER  SUPPORTED NEWS COLUMNIST, CO-HOST OF LOUD AND CLEAR ON SPUTNIK RADIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --so what - what do you - so, you read that story in The New York  Times on Friday. Tell me if it ratified or contradicted what you already  believed about how government works.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Oh, no, this - this absolutely ratified what I believed about  government. First of all, Andrew McCarthy is exactly right. This is what  the FBI does. And it predates 9 - 2017 by at least a year. </p><p>Don't forget, Tucker, that the CIA has a Counterintelligence Center that  works very, very closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. </p><p>So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim  Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We  should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian  spy.\"</p><p>The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s. They did it to Martin  Luther King in the 60s, to George McGovern in '72. If they don't like you,  they call you a communist or they call you a Russian dupe, and then they  let the propaganda and the press takeover.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean why would Liberals, of all people, stand by and allow that  to happen? Isn't - I mean this - wasn't this their Fever Dream that some  unaccountable cabal of bureaucrats in the national security state would  subvert democracy? Why aren't they saying something about this?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Because they hate Donald Trump that much. They don't like the  man. They don't like his policies. And they see the only way or the best  way to unseat him as using what's - what we call the Deep State.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, what does this mean for future presidents? I mean if - if  Kamala Harris or just pick a - pick a candidate, gets elected next time, or  the time after that, I mean can any President really believe that his or  her bureaucracy won't try to end the presidency?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: No. I - I think that's exactly what the problem is. And what we  need here is robust Congressional oversight, which we haven't had in  decades.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: It should - it should be up to the - the Senate and House  Judiciary Committees to put a stop to this kind of nonsense before it even  - it even forms its - its own life. It - they could have smothered it in--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: --the crib and they didn't.</p><p>CARLSON: They're cheering it on.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: John, thank you. It's great to see you, always.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: My pleasure, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the government shutdown continues. Americans bore - America's  border remains a mess, obviously. MS-13 gang members, using a legal  loophole to stay within this country's borders. That's next. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: HUNTING MS-13.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well a vicious MS-13 attack in New York is being blamed on  America's gaping immigration loopholes. Ramon Arevalo Lopez and Oscar  Canales Molina allegedly took part in an MS-13 assault on two New York High  School students.</p><p>Both of the alleged assailants were detained at the border in 2016. But  since they were unaccompanied minors at the time, they were allowed to  settle in this country, while awaiting deportation. </p><p>Of course, they were never deported. Nobody ever is. Without that catch and  release policy, the crime likely wouldn't have happened.</p><p>Mark Morgan was Head of the Border Patrol under President Obama. He was  dismissed by President Trump, which you should keep in mind as you listen  to him speak, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for  coming on tonight.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF, FORMER FBI AGENT: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is it too much to say that this is a real-world example of  what can happen if you have a dysfunctional immigration policy?</p><p>MORGAN: That's absolutely right, Tucker. And I think you said it right is  that it's about that the immigration process in this country across the  board is broke. This is a great example--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MORGAN: --American, you know, if they could look this up, the Flores  decision. The Flores decision is what mandates the United States Border  Patrol to release minor children. They only have a few amount of days. </p><p>And once they hit that, they've got to release them, regardless if they've  been properly vetted, regardless if they have a - a parent in the United  States, they have to be released into the interior United States.</p><p>CARLSON: And so, that's a judicial ruling. A - a court came up with that  decision. Could - has Congress ever acted on it? I mean, since clearly  that's crazy, why doesn't the United States Congress fix it?</p><p>MORGAN: That's a great question, Tucker, another reason why I'm breaking my  silence, because Congress could fix this in five minutes if they wanted to.  Before I was a Chief of Border Patrol, I was with the - with - with the  FBI, and I actually--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN: --supervised MS-13 Gang Force in Southern California. We used to  catch them on surveillance wires, and they would laugh. MS-13 gang members  would laugh how easy it was to go back and forth between the - the Mexico  and U.S. border.</p><p>CARLSON: So, we've had a number of debates on this show with Democrats who  say there's something bigoted about criticizing MS-13. As someone who's  actually worked to apprehend MS-13, how would you respond to that?</p><p>MORGAN: That's ridiculous. MS-13, and - and I know this may be  controversial. But when the - when the President referred to them as  animals, I - I absolutely said, \"That is correct,\" those MS-13 members.</p><p>And I can tell you, again, because I've worked it, and I've been there as a  Chief, I've been to the detention facilities where I've walked up to these  individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at  them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said, \"That is a soon- to-be MS-13 gang member.\" It's unequivocal.</p><p>CARLSON: And their - their - their victims are overwhelmingly immigrants  themselves, right?</p><p>MORGAN: That's - that's another untold story, Tucker, that I'm glad you're  talking about tonight. That's absolutely correct. That's another  incredulous thing. They absolutely prey on their own.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So if you - if you cared, you would care about that. Mr.  Morgan, thank you very much. Mark Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well California has been staying up late thinking of new ways to  make life harder for normal people, the ones who haven't moved to Idaho  yet. We'll tell you what they're doing after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many  consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because  the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that?</p><p>Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the  GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly  Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do  it?</p><p>And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's  really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal  immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who  are already here illegally.</p><p>Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They  agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a  political matter? It's worth thinking about that. </p><p>A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration  is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter  enforcement of America's immigration laws.</p><p>According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of  American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter  believe America has too many immigrants already. </p><p>And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious.  These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from  future waves of lower-skilled immigrants.</p><p>So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the  Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise  their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for  that, passionately.</p><p>One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is  better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than  having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that  question of about 60 percent.</p><p>Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic  mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the  national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political  terms.</p><p>Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to  raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That  means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home  raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it.</p><p>So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of  overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want  most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at  home? </p><p>19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares?  Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should  have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for  once?</p><p>Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids  their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all  colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make  this a happier country.</p><p>Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live,  really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by  the day. What's happening?</p><p>Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, how about a new water tax,  Tucker? Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't said what the new water tax would cost  California residents. But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry  Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month.</p><p>That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature.  Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean  drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the  Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary  because the state has many alternate funding solutions.</p><p>And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the  proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a  new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" </p><p>Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper  receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to  make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer  specifically wants one. </p><p>Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by  the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the  businesses. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That'll work. Trace Gallagher, great to see you.</p><p>GALLAGHER: You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn, joins us tonight. You know,  sometimes Mark, you hear an idea that's so brilliant, it's a transformative  idea.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like when Galileo got back from stargazing and hit you  with it, you know, I can't (ph) make sense. </p><p>I was walking down Market Street today, in fact, in San Francisco, and  there are people passed out, and there's human feces all over the sidewalk,  and it occurred to me, if only they would ban paper receipts, maybe all of  this would be better.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. I - I think so. As Trace was saying, they - this - these paper  receipts con - contain a chemical called BPA, which if you eat it, in high  quantities, can call birth - could cause birth defects. </p><p>And clearly, that's why California last year had the lowest fertility rate  in its entire history because people aren't having any bar - births because  they're eating too many receipts.</p><p>If you go to a Beverly Hills restaurant, and the waiter says, \"Do you want  the curly endive salad,\" and the lady says, \"No, I'll just have the receipt  and a glass of water. Oh, no wait. I can't afford the tax on the water.  Just bring me the receipt.\"</p><p>I - I had a 40-receipt a day habit. I used to buy packs of cigarettes just  so I could eat the receipts. But I actually think - I actually think,  Tucker, there's a serious point in this. The beneficiary of this would be  the Twitter guy who also makes--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --these little square machines that you see which issue the  electronic receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And if you think about it, Tucker, just as social media has meant  that news and information and knowledge is just in the hands of four or  five companies around the world now, imagine if actual money just came  under the control of the same four or five people who control social media? </p><p>I'd rather have a paper receipt than the Twitter guy controlling receipts.</p><p>CARLSON: Well OK, so but that's not actually--</p><p>STEYN: I have not that thing (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --a crazy thing to say because there are, as you know, proposals  every year to do--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --away with paper money and to make everything paperless.</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why, you know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --at a time when big tech has shown no respect for the First  Amendment, for freedom of association, really, any right at all where they  - they ape Communist China, why would we trust them to control all of our  commercial transactions?</p><p>STEYN: Because I think the same that there is now a generation of people  who think this is entirely normal. I mean I don't - I don't want to go all,  you know, electromagnetic pulse on you. </p><p>But one of the problems with that is if - if that ever does happen, we'll  be going back to the mid-19th Century, but with a population that no longer  knows what people knew in the mid-19th Century, including that it sometimes  helps to be able to have paper receipts. </p><p>It sometimes helps not to deliver more and more of the daily functioning of  the world into the same four or five companies.</p><p>CARLSON: That's so - I actually hadn't put those - those together, but I  should have. That's why we're always so grateful to have you on, Mark  Steyn, a genius.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>So, the latest FBI revelations, Friday, in The New York Times, we learned  that the bureau did not agree with the President's policy positions on  Russia, and so they accused him internally of being a spy for Russia. Hmm?  Are the Democrats OK with that? We'll ask one after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: People doing that investigation were people that have been caught  that are known scoundrels. They're in my - I guess you could say, they're  dirty cops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was the President today responding to the story on Friday  that the FBI tried to investigate him as a foreign spy. That happened. No  one contested (ph) it did. How is the Democratic Party viewing this  development? </p><p>Joining us tonight is Richard Goodstein. He's a lawyer. He advised both  Bill and Hillary Clinton. Richard, good to see you tonight.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Thanks for having me. Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the core of The New York Times story. The officials at  the FBI watched the President on the campaign trail in 2016. </p><p>And they watched him say, and I'm quoting now from a press conference, July  26th, I believe, 2016, in Florida, \"There's nothing I'd rather do than have  a Russia - than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right  now. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example,  Russia, I'm all for it.\"</p><p>So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and  they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you  say?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's where I think you and most Democrats disagree. As Dick  Cheney said, what the Russians did in the 2016 elections was an act of war.  This was unprecedented. You talked in your opening monologue today about  what was unprecedented about this investigation of Donald Trump.</p><p>We could spend the rest of this show, not just this segment, listing all  the things that he's done, siding with Putin in Helsinki against our  intelligence agencies.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That's unprecedented. The list--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So but wait, let me--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --goes on.</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you. So, there's no question that he has a different  view from the neocon establishment in Washington, the ones that have  destroyed our country and the world, and have never gone to prison,  unfortunately, as a result of what they did. </p><p>So, he is different. There's no doubt about that. But I'm just wondering as  a kind of factual matter, is there something wrong, if I were to say on the  air, you know, I kind of - I kind of like Russia, or, you know, I think  they're a lot better than China, would that make my loyalty to America  suspect? Would that--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But that--</p><p>CARLSON: --qualify me for an FBI investigation, would it?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. But if you were a--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --presidential candidate and said to the public, to the  Russians, please steal from Hillary Clinton, please steal from her, that  would actually, and then, you actually knew as the intelligence agencies--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that the Russians were stealing from her and that Trump--</p><p>CARLSON: When did--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --was using it a hundreds of times--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and we'd actually don't know what else these intercepts of--</p><p>CARLSON: We don't - we don't know. We don't know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --we don't know. We will.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But we do know - let me ask you this, do you think that it's  within bounds for the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world to  see a politician they don't like open an investigation into whether he  committed treason, discover that he did not commit treason, file no charges  against him, and then leak the existence of that investigation to the  press?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that's - that's - that's an OK way to conduct  business within an Executive Branch? Are you comfortable with that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well the predicate is that we - he didn't commit treason, which  is siding - aiding and abetting your enemy. Actually, I think on the public  record, we know that he kind of has, whether that rises to the level of  anybody in Congress or the public--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look, you don't agree - no, but hold on - I'm talking about  the law enforcement. Look, you don't agree with Trump, you don't agree with  his Russia policy, I think that's fine. I have no interest in seeing the  FBI open an investigation into you for disagreeing with me because I'm not  a fascist. </p><p>But I'm just wondering if you think it's OK for a law enforcement agency to  investigate a politician whose views they disagree with, find no chargeable  evidence, and then leak the fact they investigated him, in order to  discredit him, are you comfortable with that standard? That's all I'm  asking</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, we - we don't know that they haven't found  chargeable evidence, one. We - until Mueller has his report--</p><p>CARLSON: Why don't they charge him?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well - well let's see what Mueller has to say, which--</p><p>CARLSON: This isn't Mueller. Wait, hold on. This isn't Mueller. He's  running a separate investigation--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: He picked it (ph) up.</p><p>CARLSON: --which is an independent--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: We actually (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's - independent for Mueller. This was the FBI. Did they - if  they didn't find anything, is it OK even if they did find something,  shouldn't we learn about it in the filing of charges, like is it OK to  discredit politicians using a law enforcement agency? Is that - is that  cool with you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well when you say filing of charges, I - I - I tend to agree, I  think, with you that probably prosecuting a sitting President is not  something that's considered appropriate. That's what impeachment's for.</p><p>So again, your predicate for your - your kind of assertion about misconduct  by the FBI is something I just don't, and I think most Democrats, and most  of the public, doesn't subscribe to, which is the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so - so it's OK? I just want to know like what's the standard  going forward? So, President Harris three years from now will have views  that I don't agree with. If I see the FBI investigate her for having those  views--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if she is consorting--</p><p>CARLSON: --for being too close to Uzbekistan or whatever--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but they don't charge her but then they leak that they thought  maybe she was a quisling, that's totally fine. It's not a big deal.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And if Uzbekistan had the way to change the United States  elections, and she consorted with them, and her son did, and her son-in-law  did, and other - and her Campaign Chairman was an aide to the Uzbekistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --government, yes, and - and actually change the platform of the  Democratic Party--</p><p>CARLSON: Change the platform?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to - to help the Uzbekistan, yes, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's OK--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they - they might (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. It's OK - can I just ask (ph) one last question. Is it  - do you think it's moral for the - for me as a parent, for example, to  say, I don't think that my son should fight for the territorial integrity  of Ukraine, or am I somehow working for Putin, if I think that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, Tucker, people have different views as to what's the  standard by which their people - their - their flesh and blood should be  committed to the defense of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But so - so--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Some people in (ph) the military--</p><p>CARLSON: --why should I care? Why should I care about--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why we should care if the--</p><p>CARLSON: --whether Russia invades Ukraine? I mean I'm not against--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why.</p><p>CARLSON: --Ukraine. I'm just saying like why - I'm an American. Why do I  care?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Here's why. Be - because if you--</p><p>CARLSON: Remind me.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --if you look at the Russian press, I think they're coming to  believe that Donald Trump is, sorry, a stooge and, therefore, they can get  away with things in Ukraine in--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but why do I care, just super quick--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --right in Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell me why I care if they take over Ukraine? I'm not - I'm not- -</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Be - because and that's testing with (ph) Europe and--</p><p>CARLSON: --calling for invasion of Ukraine but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, again, you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so they're going to - they're going to invade Liechtenstein  next like this is not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, it's not Liechtenstein, actually--</p><p>CARLSON: --settling, you can (ph) hear yourself?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --I think they're trying to - we - we know that they're meddling  in Brexit--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and these elections in France and elsewhere. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, they're (ph) invading England. OK, OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're doing it.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Richard, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, see you.</p><p>CARLSON: We're still waiting breathlessly, of course, for the release of  the Mueller report. For some, the final import (ph) is anticipated like The  Rapture, a religious event that will expose and destroy the Incubus that is  Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, BUSINESSPERSON, AUTHOR, HOST OF THE WGBH PODCAST THE SCIF,  CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I personally think that what Mueller is  heading to, is not only the indictments, because remember, there maybe  more, right.</p><p>He's not going to, you know, he's going to, there - there may be more  coming down the pike.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, JOURNALIST, CNN TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p>KAYYEM: But also a report that discloses the extent to which Trump and his  family are compromised by the Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Compromised! How do I get to be a CNN analyst? Low bar, obviously. </p><p>Others though are more cautious that one - Mueller's report could be a  disappointment in the end.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: People who are  closest to - to what Mueller has been doing of, interacting with the  Special Counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti- climactic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr is a former Independent Counsel, of course. He's the  Author of the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation, and he  joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on, Judge. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure which I'm rooting for, the anti-climactic version  of the report or the report that actually answers the questions  outstanding. </p><p>But if it turns out the report does not find the President colluded with  Russia, and goes in another direction, shouldn't Mueller offer some kind of  apology for gumming up the wheels of government for two years and  destroying public - I'm serious, and destroying public confidence--</p><p>STARR: No, I know you are. I know you are, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --in every institution this country has?</p><p>STARR: I - I understand, Tucker. I have a different view. And that view is  that Mueller should bring this to a close. We've needed to know the answer  about collusion for a long time. And I think he knows that answer. </p><p>And I wish we would know that pretty darn soon because that goes to the  heart of American politics etcetera several roles (ph) our relationships  with Russia. But here's why I'm not subscribing to the anti-Mueller view.</p><p>All of the Republican leadership agrees, \"Let him finish his work.\" Bill  Barr, the nominee, and who's superbly qualified is not - now saying, \"Let  him finish his work.\" And that's what I want him to do. Now--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --I will say this in addition (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But let me just say, there's no group I respect less.</p><p>STARR: Those--</p><p>CARLSON: So, that holds no water with me. I'm just wondering, as an  American, why wouldn't the interest of the country--</p><p>STARR: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --come before all of this stuff like well - how are we benefiting  from this--</p><p>STARR: I couldn't--</p><p>CARLSON: --protracted investigation?</p><p>STARR: Because Bob Mueller has been finding stuff that needed to be found  out, specifically the 13 Russian individuals and the two organizations.  You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a  very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an  indictment.</p><p>But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't  have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second  indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the  Trump Administration.</p><p>So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was  interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian  individuals, because of - of interference. </p><p>Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a  report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is,  you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people  in reports. </p><p>You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you  don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: And that's the regulation. Listen, one of the many problems, as you  know, the Independent Counsel Law under which I served is it called for  this vast report to do what? To go to the House of Representatives for  purposes of impeachment. Let's get the Justice Department out of that  business entirely.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I would say that. The deal (ph)--</p><p>STARR: House Representatives--</p><p>CARLSON: --that - right. Just leaking against people they don't like,  little, little scary, I would think.</p><p>STARR: Oh, that is terrible. In fact--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: --let me comment on that, if I may, very briefly. When--</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly, if you would, yes.</p><p>STARR: --when I read The New York Times article, my first reaction was we  need an investigation right now as to who leaked this. We think we know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: What was their motivation, and why the timing? This was many months  ago. There's been--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --no suggestion whatsoever of - to support this outrageous charge  against the President.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. It's pretty scary. Ken Starr, thank you very much.</p><p>STARR: My pleasure, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is running for president as a Democrat.  Some of her foreign policy views diverge from those of official Washington,  so they're trying to destroy and defame her.</p><p>Huh! Interesting! We've got details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: It's been close to two months now. But the Yellow Jacket - Yellow  Vests, rather, protests in France are still going on. In some ways, they're  getting bigger. They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight  global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras.</p><p>The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed  about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think  global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. </p><p>Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to  impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in  Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a  scam. Let's just be honest about it.  Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they  actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal  of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. </p><p>This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its  own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in  city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. </p><p>Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for  the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their  governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as  their top priority. </p><p>America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country  are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa,  screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why  not knock over a speed camera or two?</p><p>Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you  might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight  the system. They fight to preserve it.</p><p>Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced  that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been  savaged by the Left.</p><p>Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of  Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that  country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage  in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other  major Democrat opposed gay marriage.</p><p>So, what is this really about?</p><p>Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about.  He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a  defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. </p><p>But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to  be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?</p><p>GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT CO-FOUNDER, LAWYER, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: So,  yes, I'm not a - a - a supporter of Congresswoman Gabbard's candidacy.  There are some really legitimate and serious concerns that I have that have  been raised by the real Left, not the Democratic Party Liberals--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --about some of her support for the war on terror, her - her -  her affinity for Hindu nationalism in India, her affection for some really  terrible dictators that I think she should answer for, and be - be clear  about. </p><p>But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she  resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie  Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then  supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that.</p><p>But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington  orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we  continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria,  and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we  do in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington  Consensus. She's hard to put into a Liberal or a Conservative or a Right- wing or a Left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the  most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers.</p><p>CARLSON: But there's something so stealthy and feline and dishonest about  the way they're attacking her. If you don't like her foreign policy views,  then let's just say so. But no one ever really wants to debate what our  foreign policy should be. They just attack anybody who deviates from their  own dumb ideas. Have you noticed this?</p><p>GREENWALD: Yes. Well so, I think there's one particular smear that has  become extremely pervasive in U.S. discourse that is central to sustaining  the United States as a country that's at endless war, which is if you don't  support a particular war that Washington wants, to remove a particular  leader, you get accused of being a supporter of that Dictator.</p><p>In 2002 and '03--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GREENWALD: --people who were against the Iraq War were accused often on  this network but others as well--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, sure.</p><p>GREENWALD: --ridiculously accused of - of - of loving Saddam Hussein.  People who - who opposed the intervention in Libya in 2011 were accused of  being apologists for Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p>And now, Tulsi Gabbard is being accused of being a supporter of someone  that she actually called a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, because she's  asking why it is that we are spending a billion dollars a year, or were  arming rebels, who we don't know, trying to remove the leader of a foreign  country, and engaging in all kinds of policies that are actually worsening  the security of the United States rather than helping them.</p><p>You can criticize her. But to accuse her of being a supporter of - or a  best friend of, as Claire McCaskill put it, Bashar al-Assad is just  idiotic, but it's really toxic as well because it's the kind of argument--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GREENWALD: --hauled out always to defend Washington foreign policy.</p><p>CARLSON: It's the kind of argument that ends the argument, and that's the  point. Glenn Greenwald, thank you always for your incisive views on that.</p><p>GREENWALD: Good to be here, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back, have no fear, tomorrow  night, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity,  smugness, and groupthink. We hope you'll join us then. </p><p>Have a great evening, meantime. Guess who's next? You guessed it. And we're  going to throw to him nine seconds early, Sean Hannity.

We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that  broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it  then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department  of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether  the President is in fact a Russian agent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper  cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and  working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said  they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the  President of the United States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this  has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without  precedent. That is not overstatement.</p><p> And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that  Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him.  None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did  this happen?</p><p> Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not  a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation  and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels  of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing. </p><p> All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would  need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story,  we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret  transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln  Bedroom, no. Think again.</p><p> There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI  assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything  he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public,  standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of  them.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's nothing I can  think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way  they are right now.</p><p> Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia?  I'm all for it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in  Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you  just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's  their view.</p><p> But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right.  Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's (ph) on the other  side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States.  It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten  our key allies like Japan or Great Britain.</p><p> Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with  Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting  a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin? </p><p> And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the  territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is  very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very  many people, it turns out. </p><p> So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In  Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ROBERT WARNER, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRATIC  PARTY MEMBER, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR OF THE  SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Vladimir Putin policies almost being  parroted by Donald Trump. You had Trump say only nice things about Putin.  He never spoke ill about Russia.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States  Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our  enemies. </p><p> So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if  he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with  prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have  spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer.</p><p> Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional  dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian  spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political  positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.</p><p> Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and  this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the  permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent  from their agenda. That's what this is.</p><p> And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd  know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader  gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so  those agencies try to put him in jail.</p><p> It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former  FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking  in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous  country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to,  \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread  our democratic ideals.\"</p><p> So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most  important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all  costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No  wonder Max Boot is on board with this.</p><p> Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too.  They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly  reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause  brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.</p><p> No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly  Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have  determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that.  The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian  crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak (ph) crickets. Whatever!</p><p> The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on.  They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline.  Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying  that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did. </p><p> Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: Well Kristy (ph), the President's tweet trying to make  the case that he's not a Russian asset really just undercuts his own  defense. The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was  written by Putin himself. </p><p> Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting  past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their  actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission. </p><p> Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly  what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just  making Russia's job easier.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: You say you're not a Russian agent, therefore, you're a Russian  agent. Who puts these people on TV? That's a question we should think  about. </p><p> Over the weekend, speaking of television, CNN President Jeff Zucker  declared that anyone who isn't spreading fear of Russia is doing the  bidding of Russia. Now, Zucker didn't say that himself, of course. He  rarely speaks in public. Instead, he sent his marionette out, as he often  does, to deliver the message.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN'S RELIABLE  SOURCES HOST, FORMER MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, FORMER TVNEWSER  EDITOR: I was watching Good Morning America this weekend. And both  mornings, they led with snowstorms and scares at malls and other stories,  and not this. </p><p> And I - I just keep wondering if - if the public is ill-served, if we don't  make it really clear what the stakes of this story are. How - how can a  morning show not lead with this drama, I guess is what I'm saying.</p><p> CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: I think - I think plenty  of times we lead with - with this drama.</p><p> STELTER: OK. Well, I agree.</p><p> BERNSTEIN: And - and - and with--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So the eunuch (ph) heads to the steps of the palace and reads the  proclamation. Message received, thank you very much.</p><p> But take three steps back. Is the media's problem really that it doesn't  talk about Russia enough? Doesn't seem like that's the problem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the President was working for Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was secretly working on behalf  of Russia.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER CHARLES CUOMO, TELEVISION JOURNALIST, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Whether  the President was secretly working with Russia against America.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of the  Russians.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whether President Trump was working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working on Russia's behalf.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the sitting President was secretly working for  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working for Russia from The  Oval Office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes,  it's the DNC.  You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise,  Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is,  does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is  doing the bidding of Russia? </p><p> I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's  say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American  interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive  foreign wars. </p><p> You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made  America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say,  Syria and Libya? </p><p> You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S.  to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American  government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the  name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.</p><p> Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S.  would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state.  Their economy is dependent on energy.</p><p> But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done  just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my  lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil  and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not.</p><p> Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones  pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and  gas wells across the nation. Huh! </p><p> Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so  many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the  task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical  transparency.</p><p> Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of  Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly  didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read  by the federal government, on what basis? </p><p> We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it.  He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the  Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa  Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials.</p><p> Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for  reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And  we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the  reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. </p><p> They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New  York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information  when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents  might embarrass the FBI.</p><p> This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this  country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of  federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government,  bring in some sunlight. </p><p> Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them,  and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected  leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the  people, and not the other way around.</p><p> The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his  own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him  a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have.</p><p> Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  of New York, and he joins us tonight. </p><p> Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The  Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like  FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an  appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?</p><p> ANDREW MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, FORMER ASSISTANT  UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: No, it's not,  Tucker. It's not a - appropriate pretext for the FBI for any investigation. </p><p> And I must say that, you know, listening to your monologue, it occurs to me  that, you know, since the Soviet Union fell, it's been the purpose of this  government it seems, under administrations of both parties, to treat Russia  as if it were England.</p><p> And I remember, you know, the Obama debate with Mitt Romney where, you  know, Romney suggested that Russia was a geopolitical, our greatest  geopolitical enemy, and Obama mocked him for that. Obama--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --on a - in a conversation with Medvedev, who is basically the  cat's paw for Putin, you know, says thinking he's not being heard, you  know, as soon as I get by this election, I'll have more flexibility. I -  imagine if Trump had said these sorts of things.</p><p> But I - I must say, listening to all that, it - it seems like Trump is the  guy who was left without a chair when the music stopped, because all of a  sudden, everything that was regular and fine is now, you know, now - now  Trump is - I'm sorry, Russia's back to being, you know, I guess we're back  in the Cold War.</p><p> And look, I - I think I probably find Russia to be more of a threat than  you do.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MCCARTHY: But the FBI is not supposed to be doing policy. That's not their  job.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean why was there no - but and there's a lot that we don't  know. But from that story, and no one has contested the basic facts that I  have seen, officials in the FBI sat down and decided it is unacceptable for  an elect - elected leader to come to these policy conclusions therefore,  there must be some sinister motive. </p><p> Why did no one in the FBI say, \"Wait a second. This is demonstrably not our  job. We're not allowed to do this.\"</p><p> MCCARTHY: Because they didn't start doing it in May 2017. In May 2017,  Tucker, all they did was, as a formal paper matter, they opened an  investigation, specifically, on Trump. But it was the same investigation  that had been being conducted for a year.</p><p> I keep going back to this - the Steele dossier. You've - you mentioned the  warrant that they got on Carter Page. That was mainly on the Steele  dossier. The Steele dossier is not about Carter Page, and it's not even  about prostitutes in a - in a Moscow hotel. The theory of the--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --of the Steele dossier is that Trump and Russia, Trump and the  Kremlin, Trump, personally, and the Kremlin, are in a conspiracy, an  espionage conspiracy to subvert the election, so that Trump can get in and  do Russia's bidding. That was what they went to the FISA Court with in  order to get a warrant on Carter Page.</p><p> So, the theory behind this, if you look at the - the - the Steele dossier,  guys like Page and Manafort and Cohen, they're sort of the emissaries  between the Trump side of the conspiracy and the Kremlin side of the  conspiracy, but the - the whole thing's about Trump, and it was always--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --about Trump. And all that happened in May of 2017 is they went  overt in their files on something that they had been covertly doing for  over a year.</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's - that's such a - you are the only one I've heard make  that point. It's a really smart point. Andy McCarthy, thank you very much  for that, over a year, unbelievable.</p><p> MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer, and a whistleblower, who  knows the federal government very well through hard experience. John,  thanks very much for coming on tonight. Does this--</p><p> JOHN CHRIS KIRIAKOU, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CIA OFFICER, READER  SUPPORTED NEWS COLUMNIST, CO-HOST OF LOUD AND CLEAR ON SPUTNIK RADIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: --so what - what do you - so, you read that story in The New York  Times on Friday. Tell me if it ratified or contradicted what you already  believed about how government works.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Oh, no, this - this absolutely ratified what I believed about  government. First of all, Andrew McCarthy is exactly right. This is what  the FBI does. And it predates 9 - 2017 by at least a year. </p><p> Don't forget, Tucker, that the CIA has a Counterintelligence Center that  works very, very closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. </p><p> So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim  Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We  should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian  spy.\"</p><p> The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s. They did it to Martin  Luther King in the 60s, to George McGovern in '72. If they don't like you,  they call you a communist or they call you a Russian dupe, and then they  let the propaganda and the press takeover.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean why would Liberals, of all people, stand by and allow that  to happen? Isn't - I mean this - wasn't this their Fever Dream that some  unaccountable cabal of bureaucrats in the national security state would  subvert democracy? Why aren't they saying something about this?</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Because they hate Donald Trump that much. They don't like the  man. They don't like his policies. And they see the only way or the best  way to unseat him as using what's - what we call the Deep State.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean, what does this mean for future presidents? I mean if - if  Kamala Harris or just pick a - pick a candidate, gets elected next time, or  the time after that, I mean can any President really believe that his or  her bureaucracy won't try to end the presidency?</p><p> KIRIAKOU: No. I - I think that's exactly what the problem is. And what we  need here is robust Congressional oversight, which we haven't had in  decades.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: It should - it should be up to the - the Senate and House  Judiciary Committees to put a stop to this kind of nonsense before it even  - it even forms its - its own life. It - they could have smothered it in--</p><p> CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: --the crib and they didn't.</p><p> CARLSON: They're cheering it on.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: John, thank you. It's great to see you, always.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: My pleasure, thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: Well the government shutdown continues. Americans bore - America's  border remains a mess, obviously. MS-13 gang members, using a legal  loophole to stay within this country's borders. That's next. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> TEXT: HUNTING MS-13.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well a vicious MS-13 attack in New York is being blamed on  America's gaping immigration loopholes. Ramon Arevalo Lopez and Oscar  Canales Molina allegedly took part in an MS-13 assault on two New York High  School students.</p><p> Both of the alleged assailants were detained at the border in 2016. But  since they were unaccompanied minors at the time, they were allowed to  settle in this country, while awaiting deportation. </p><p> Of course, they were never deported. Nobody ever is. Without that catch and  release policy, the crime likely wouldn't have happened.</p><p> Mark Morgan was Head of the Border Patrol under President Obama. He was  dismissed by President Trump, which you should keep in mind as you listen  to him speak, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for  coming on tonight.</p><p> MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF, FORMER FBI AGENT: You bet.</p><p> CARLSON: So, is it too much to say that this is a real-world example of  what can happen if you have a dysfunctional immigration policy?</p><p> MORGAN: That's absolutely right, Tucker. And I think you said it right is  that it's about that the immigration process in this country across the  board is broke. This is a great example--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MORGAN: --American, you know, if they could look this up, the Flores  decision. The Flores decision is what mandates the United States Border  Patrol to release minor children. They only have a few amount of days. </p><p> And once they hit that, they've got to release them, regardless if they've  been properly vetted, regardless if they have a - a parent in the United  States, they have to be released into the interior United States.</p><p> CARLSON: And so, that's a judicial ruling. A - a court came up with that  decision. Could - has Congress ever acted on it? I mean, since clearly  that's crazy, why doesn't the United States Congress fix it?</p><p> MORGAN: That's a great question, Tucker, another reason why I'm breaking my  silence, because Congress could fix this in five minutes if they wanted to.  Before I was a Chief of Border Patrol, I was with the - with - with the  FBI, and I actually--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MORGAN: --supervised MS-13 Gang Force in Southern California. We used to  catch them on surveillance wires, and they would laugh. MS-13 gang members  would laugh how easy it was to go back and forth between the - the Mexico  and U.S. border.</p><p> CARLSON: So, we've had a number of debates on this show with Democrats who  say there's something bigoted about criticizing MS-13. As someone who's  actually worked to apprehend MS-13, how would you respond to that?</p><p> MORGAN: That's ridiculous. MS-13, and - and I know this may be  controversial. But when the - when the President referred to them as  animals, I - I absolutely said, \"That is correct,\" those MS-13 members.</p><p> And I can tell you, again, because I've worked it, and I've been there as a  Chief, I've been to the detention facilities where I've walked up to these  individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at  them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said, \"That is a soon- to-be MS-13 gang member.\" It's unequivocal.</p><p> CARLSON: And their - their - their victims are overwhelmingly immigrants  themselves, right?</p><p> MORGAN: That's - that's another untold story, Tucker, that I'm glad you're  talking about tonight. That's absolutely correct. That's another  incredulous thing. They absolutely prey on their own.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. So if you - if you cared, you would care about that. Mr.  Morgan, thank you very much. Mark Morgan, great to see you.</p><p> MORGAN: You bet.</p><p> CARLSON: Well California has been staying up late thinking of new ways to  make life harder for normal people, the ones who haven't moved to Idaho  yet. We'll tell you what they're doing after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many  consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because  the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that?</p><p> Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the  GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly  Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do  it?</p><p> And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's  really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal  immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who  are already here illegally.</p><p> Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They  agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a  political matter? It's worth thinking about that. </p><p> A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration  is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter  enforcement of America's immigration laws.</p><p> According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of  American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter  believe America has too many immigrants already. </p><p> And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious.  These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from  future waves of lower-skilled immigrants.</p><p> So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the  Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise  their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for  that, passionately.</p><p> One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is  better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than  having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that  question of about 60 percent.</p><p> Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic  mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the  national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political  terms.</p><p> Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to  raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That  means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home  raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it.</p><p> So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of  overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want  most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at  home? </p><p> 19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares?  Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should  have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for  once?</p><p> Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids  their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all  colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make  this a happier country.</p><p> Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live,  really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by  the day. What's happening?</p><p> Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, how about a new water tax,  Tucker? Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't said what the new water tax would cost  California residents. But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry  Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month.</p><p> That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature.  Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean  drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the  Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary  because the state has many alternate funding solutions.</p><p> And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the  proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a  new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" </p><p> Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper  receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to  make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer  specifically wants one. </p><p> Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by  the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the  businesses. Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: That'll work. Trace Gallagher, great to see you.</p><p> GALLAGHER: You too.</p><p> CARLSON: Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn, joins us tonight. You know,  sometimes Mark, you hear an idea that's so brilliant, it's a transformative  idea.</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: It's almost like when Galileo got back from stargazing and hit you  with it, you know, I can't (ph) make sense. </p><p> I was walking down Market Street today, in fact, in San Francisco, and  there are people passed out, and there's human feces all over the sidewalk,  and it occurred to me, if only they would ban paper receipts, maybe all of  this would be better.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. I - I think so. As Trace was saying, they - this - these paper  receipts con - contain a chemical called BPA, which if you eat it, in high  quantities, can call birth - could cause birth defects. </p><p> And clearly, that's why California last year had the lowest fertility rate  in its entire history because people aren't having any bar - births because  they're eating too many receipts.</p><p> If you go to a Beverly Hills restaurant, and the waiter says, \"Do you want  the curly endive salad,\" and the lady says, \"No, I'll just have the receipt  and a glass of water. Oh, no wait. I can't afford the tax on the water.  Just bring me the receipt.\"</p><p> I - I had a 40-receipt a day habit. I used to buy packs of cigarettes just  so I could eat the receipts. But I actually think - I actually think,  Tucker, there's a serious point in this. The beneficiary of this would be  the Twitter guy who also makes--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --these little square machines that you see which issue the  electronic receipts.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And if you think about it, Tucker, just as social media has meant  that news and information and knowledge is just in the hands of four or  five companies around the world now, imagine if actual money just came  under the control of the same four or five people who control social media? </p><p> I'd rather have a paper receipt than the Twitter guy controlling receipts.</p><p> CARLSON: Well OK, so but that's not actually--</p><p> STEYN: I have not that thing (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --a crazy thing to say because there are, as you know, proposals  every year to do--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --away with paper money and to make everything paperless.</p><p> STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: So, why, you know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --at a time when big tech has shown no respect for the First  Amendment, for freedom of association, really, any right at all where they  - they ape Communist China, why would we trust them to control all of our  commercial transactions?</p><p> STEYN: Because I think the same that there is now a generation of people  who think this is entirely normal. I mean I don't - I don't want to go all,  you know, electromagnetic pulse on you. </p><p> But one of the problems with that is if - if that ever does happen, we'll  be going back to the mid-19th Century, but with a population that no longer  knows what people knew in the mid-19th Century, including that it sometimes  helps to be able to have paper receipts. </p><p> It sometimes helps not to deliver more and more of the daily functioning of  the world into the same four or five companies.</p><p> CARLSON: That's so - I actually hadn't put those - those together, but I  should have. That's why we're always so grateful to have you on, Mark  Steyn, a genius.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> So, the latest FBI revelations, Friday, in The New York Times, we learned  that the bureau did not agree with the President's policy positions on  Russia, and so they accused him internally of being a spy for Russia. Hmm?  Are the Democrats OK with that? We'll ask one after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP: People doing that investigation were people that have been caught  that are known scoundrels. They're in my - I guess you could say, they're  dirty cops.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: That was the President today responding to the story on Friday  that the FBI tried to investigate him as a foreign spy. That happened. No  one contested (ph) it did. How is the Democratic Party viewing this  development? </p><p> Joining us tonight is Richard Goodstein. He's a lawyer. He advised both  Bill and Hillary Clinton. Richard, good to see you tonight.</p><p> RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Thanks for having me. Sure (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: So, here's the core of The New York Times story. The officials at  the FBI watched the President on the campaign trail in 2016. </p><p> And they watched him say, and I'm quoting now from a press conference, July  26th, I believe, 2016, in Florida, \"There's nothing I'd rather do than have  a Russia - than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right  now. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example,  Russia, I'm all for it.\"</p><p> So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and  they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you  say?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's where I think you and most Democrats disagree. As Dick  Cheney said, what the Russians did in the 2016 elections was an act of war.  This was unprecedented. You talked in your opening monologue today about  what was unprecedented about this investigation of Donald Trump.</p><p> We could spend the rest of this show, not just this segment, listing all  the things that he's done, siding with Putin in Helsinki against our  intelligence agencies.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: That's unprecedented. The list--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So but wait, let me--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --goes on.</p><p> CARLSON: --let me ask you. So, there's no question that he has a different  view from the neocon establishment in Washington, the ones that have  destroyed our country and the world, and have never gone to prison,  unfortunately, as a result of what they did. </p><p> So, he is different. There's no doubt about that. But I'm just wondering as  a kind of factual matter, is there something wrong, if I were to say on the  air, you know, I kind of - I kind of like Russia, or, you know, I think  they're a lot better than China, would that make my loyalty to America  suspect? Would that--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: But that--</p><p> CARLSON: --qualify me for an FBI investigation, would it?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No. But if you were a--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --presidential candidate and said to the public, to the  Russians, please steal from Hillary Clinton, please steal from her, that  would actually, and then, you actually knew as the intelligence agencies--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --that the Russians were stealing from her and that Trump--</p><p> CARLSON: When did--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --was using it a hundreds of times--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and we'd actually don't know what else these intercepts of--</p><p> CARLSON: We don't - we don't know. We don't know.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --we don't know. We will.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But we do know - let me ask you this, do you think that it's  within bounds for the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world to  see a politician they don't like open an investigation into whether he  committed treason, discover that he did not commit treason, file no charges  against him, and then leak the existence of that investigation to the  press?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that's - that's - that's an OK way to conduct  business within an Executive Branch? Are you comfortable with that?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well the predicate is that we - he didn't commit treason, which  is siding - aiding and abetting your enemy. Actually, I think on the public  record, we know that he kind of has, whether that rises to the level of  anybody in Congress or the public--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Look, you don't agree - no, but hold on - I'm talking about  the law enforcement. Look, you don't agree with Trump, you don't agree with  his Russia policy, I think that's fine. I have no interest in seeing the  FBI open an investigation into you for disagreeing with me because I'm not  a fascist. </p><p> But I'm just wondering if you think it's OK for a law enforcement agency to  investigate a politician whose views they disagree with, find no chargeable  evidence, and then leak the fact they investigated him, in order to  discredit him, are you comfortable with that standard? That's all I'm  asking</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well again, we - we don't know that they haven't found  chargeable evidence, one. We - until Mueller has his report--</p><p> CARLSON: Why don't they charge him?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well - well let's see what Mueller has to say, which--</p><p> CARLSON: This isn't Mueller. Wait, hold on. This isn't Mueller. He's  running a separate investigation--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: He picked it (ph) up.</p><p> CARLSON: --which is an independent--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: We actually (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on, hold on.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: It's - independent for Mueller. This was the FBI. Did they - if  they didn't find anything, is it OK even if they did find something,  shouldn't we learn about it in the filing of charges, like is it OK to  discredit politicians using a law enforcement agency? Is that - is that  cool with you?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well when you say filing of charges, I - I - I tend to agree, I  think, with you that probably prosecuting a sitting President is not  something that's considered appropriate. That's what impeachment's for.</p><p> So again, your predicate for your - your kind of assertion about misconduct  by the FBI is something I just don't, and I think most Democrats, and most  of the public, doesn't subscribe to, which is the--</p><p> CARLSON: So - so - so it's OK? I just want to know like what's the standard  going forward? So, President Harris three years from now will have views  that I don't agree with. If I see the FBI investigate her for having those  views--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And if she is consorting--</p><p> CARLSON: --for being too close to Uzbekistan or whatever--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --but they don't charge her but then they leak that they thought  maybe she was a quisling, that's totally fine. It's not a big deal.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And if Uzbekistan had the way to change the United States  elections, and she consorted with them, and her son did, and her son-in-law  did, and other - and her Campaign Chairman was an aide to the Uzbekistan--</p><p> CARLSON: Wow.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --government, yes, and - and actually change the platform of the  Democratic Party--</p><p> CARLSON: Change the platform?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --to - to help the Uzbekistan, yes, actually--</p><p> CARLSON: It's - it's OK--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --they - they might (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on. It's OK - can I just ask (ph) one last question. Is it  - do you think it's moral for the - for me as a parent, for example, to  say, I don't think that my son should fight for the territorial integrity  of Ukraine, or am I somehow working for Putin, if I think that?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Look, Tucker, people have different views as to what's the  standard by which their people - their - their flesh and blood should be  committed to the defense of the United States.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But so - so--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Some people in (ph) the military--</p><p> CARLSON: --why should I care? Why should I care about--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why we should care if the--</p><p> CARLSON: --whether Russia invades Ukraine? I mean I'm not against--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why.</p><p> CARLSON: --Ukraine. I'm just saying like why - I'm an American. Why do I  care?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why. Be - because if you--</p><p> CARLSON: Remind me.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --if you look at the Russian press, I think they're coming to  believe that Donald Trump is, sorry, a stooge and, therefore, they can get  away with things in Ukraine in--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But - but why do I care, just super quick--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --right in Afghanistan--</p><p> CARLSON: --tell me why I care if they take over Ukraine? I'm not - I'm not- -</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Be - because and that's testing with (ph) Europe and--</p><p> CARLSON: --calling for invasion of Ukraine but--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well, again, you're--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, so they're going to - they're going to invade Liechtenstein  next like this is not--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, it's not Liechtenstein, actually--</p><p> CARLSON: --settling, you can (ph) hear yourself?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --I--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --I think they're trying to - we - we know that they're meddling  in Brexit--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and these elections in France and elsewhere. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, they're (ph) invading England. OK, OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, they're doing it.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Richard, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, see you.</p><p> CARLSON: We're still waiting breathlessly, of course, for the release of  the Mueller report. For some, the final import (ph) is anticipated like The  Rapture, a religious event that will expose and destroy the Incubus that is  Donald Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIETTE KAYYEM, BUSINESSPERSON, AUTHOR, HOST OF THE WGBH PODCAST THE SCIF,  CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I personally think that what Mueller is  heading to, is not only the indictments, because remember, there maybe  more, right.</p><p> He's not going to, you know, he's going to, there - there may be more  coming down the pike.</p><p> ANA CABRERA, JOURNALIST, CNN TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p> KAYYEM: But also a report that discloses the extent to which Trump and his  family are compromised by the Russians.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Compromised! How do I get to be a CNN analyst? Low bar, obviously. </p><p> Others though are more cautious that one - Mueller's report could be a  disappointment in the end.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: People who are  closest to - to what Mueller has been doing of, interacting with the  Special Counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti- climactic.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Ken Starr is a former Independent Counsel, of course. He's the  Author of the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation, and he  joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on, Judge. So--</p><p> KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not sure which I'm rooting for, the anti-climactic version  of the report or the report that actually answers the questions  outstanding. </p><p> But if it turns out the report does not find the President colluded with  Russia, and goes in another direction, shouldn't Mueller offer some kind of  apology for gumming up the wheels of government for two years and  destroying public - I'm serious, and destroying public confidence--</p><p> STARR: No, I know you are. I know you are, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --in every institution this country has?</p><p> STARR: I - I understand, Tucker. I have a different view. And that view is  that Mueller should bring this to a close. We've needed to know the answer  about collusion for a long time. And I think he knows that answer. </p><p> And I wish we would know that pretty darn soon because that goes to the  heart of American politics etcetera several roles (ph) our relationships  with Russia. But here's why I'm not subscribing to the anti-Mueller view.</p><p> All of the Republican leadership agrees, \"Let him finish his work.\" Bill  Barr, the nominee, and who's superbly qualified is not - now saying, \"Let  him finish his work.\" And that's what I want him to do. Now--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --I will say this in addition (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But let me just say, there's no group I respect less.</p><p> STARR: Those--</p><p> CARLSON: So, that holds no water with me. I'm just wondering, as an  American, why wouldn't the interest of the country--</p><p> STARR: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --come before all of this stuff like well - how are we benefiting  from this--</p><p> STARR: I couldn't--</p><p> CARLSON: --protracted investigation?</p><p> STARR: Because Bob Mueller has been finding stuff that needed to be found  out, specifically the 13 Russian individuals and the two organizations.  You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a  very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an  indictment.</p><p> But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't  have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second  indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the  Trump Administration.</p><p> So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was  interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian  individuals, because of - of interference. </p><p> Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a  report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is,  you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people  in reports. </p><p> You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you  don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: And that's the regulation. Listen, one of the many problems, as you  know, the Independent Counsel Law under which I served is it called for  this vast report to do what? To go to the House of Representatives for  purposes of impeachment. Let's get the Justice Department out of that  business entirely.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I would say that. The deal (ph)--</p><p> STARR: House Representatives--</p><p> CARLSON: --that - right. Just leaking against people they don't like,  little, little scary, I would think.</p><p> STARR: Oh, that is terrible. In fact--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STARR: --let me comment on that, if I may, very briefly. When--</p><p> CARLSON: Very quickly, if you would, yes.</p><p> STARR: --when I read The New York Times article, my first reaction was we  need an investigation right now as to who leaked this. We think we know.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STARR: What was their motivation, and why the timing? This was many months  ago. There's been--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --no suggestion whatsoever of - to support this outrageous charge  against the President.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. It's pretty scary. Ken Starr, thank you very much.</p><p> STARR: My pleasure, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is running for president as a Democrat.  Some of her foreign policy views diverge from those of official Washington,  so they're trying to destroy and defame her.</p><p> Huh! Interesting! We've got details after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: It's been close to two months now. But the Yellow Jacket - Yellow  Vests, rather, protests in France are still going on. In some ways, they're  getting bigger. They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight  global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras.</p><p> The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed  about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think  global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. </p><p> Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to  impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in  Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a  scam. Let's just be honest about it.  Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they  actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal  of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. </p><p> This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its  own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in  city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. </p><p> Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for  the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their  governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as  their top priority. </p><p>America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country  are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa,  screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why  not knock over a speed camera or two?</p><p> Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you  might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight  the system. They fight to preserve it.</p><p> Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced  that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been  savaged by the Left.</p><p> Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of  Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that  country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage  in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other  major Democrat opposed gay marriage.</p><p> So, what is this really about?</p><p> Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about.  He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a  defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. </p><p> But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to  be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?</p><p> GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT CO-FOUNDER, LAWYER, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: So,  yes, I'm not a - a - a supporter of Congresswoman Gabbard's candidacy.  There are some really legitimate and serious concerns that I have that have  been raised by the real Left, not the Democratic Party Liberals--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GREENWALD: --about some of her support for the war on terror, her - her -  her affinity for Hindu nationalism in India, her affection for some really  terrible dictators that I think she should answer for, and be - be clear  about. </p><p> But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she  resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie  Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then  supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that.</p><p> But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington  orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we  continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria,  and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we  do in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington  Consensus. She's hard to put into a Liberal or a Conservative or a Right- wing or a Left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the  most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers.</p><p> CARLSON: But there's something so stealthy and feline and dishonest about  the way they're attacking her. If you don't like her foreign policy views,  then let's just say so. But no one ever really wants to debate what our  foreign policy should be. They just attack anybody who deviates from their  own dumb ideas. Have you noticed this?</p><p> GREENWALD: Yes. Well so, I think there's one particular smear that has  become extremely pervasive in U.S. discourse that is central to sustaining  the United States as a country that's at endless war, which is if you don't  support a particular war that Washington wants, to remove a particular  leader, you get accused of being a supporter of that Dictator.</p><p> In 2002 and '03--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GREENWALD: --people who were against the Iraq War were accused often on  this network but others as well--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, sure.</p><p> GREENWALD: --ridiculously accused of - of - of loving Saddam Hussein.  People who - who opposed the intervention in Libya in 2011 were accused of  being apologists for Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p> And now, Tulsi Gabbard is being accused of being a supporter of someone  that she actually called a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, because she's  asking why it is that we are spending a billion dollars a year, or were  arming rebels, who we don't know, trying to remove the leader of a foreign  country, and engaging in all kinds of policies that are actually worsening  the security of the United States rather than helping them.</p><p> You can criticize her. But to accuse her of being a supporter of - or a  best friend of, as Claire McCaskill put it, Bashar al-Assad is just  idiotic, but it's really toxic as well because it's the kind of argument--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GREENWALD: --hauled out always to defend Washington foreign policy.</p><p> CARLSON: It's the kind of argument that ends the argument, and that's the  point. Glenn Greenwald, thank you always for your incisive views on that.</p><p> GREENWALD: Good to be here, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back, have no fear, tomorrow  night, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity,  smugness, and groupthink. We hope you'll join us then. </p><p> Have a great evening, meantime. Guess who's next? You guessed it. And we're  going to throw to him nine seconds early, Sean Hannity. He's standing by in  New York.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY- HOST: This has become an issue. People say how many seconds  extra did Tucker steal from your show? Now - good to see. Great show as  always.</p><p> CARLSON: It's an act of love, Sean. Thank you.</p><p> HANNITY: Greenwald's an interesting guy. I like that.</p><p> CARLSON: He is an interesting guy. He's an honest man.</p><p> HANNITY: Very interesting.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> HANNITY: A whole debate about what is described as media because we know  the networks, the newspapers, and cable channels are fake news, and have  agendas, never (ph) people that are, you know, non-political that I'm  interested in.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, me too. </p><p> HANNITY: All right, Tucker. Thank you. Welcome to Hannity.</p><p> CARLSON: Still believe it (ph).</p><p> END </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that  broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it  then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department  of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether  the President is in fact a Russian agent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper  cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and  working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said  they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the  President of the United States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this  has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without  precedent. That is not overstatement.</p><p> And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that  Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him.  None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did  this happen?</p><p> Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not  a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation  and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels  of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing. </p><p> All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would  need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story,  we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret  transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln  Bedroom, no. Think again.</p><p> There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI  assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything  he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public,  standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of  them.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's nothing I can  think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way  they are right now.</p><p> Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia?  I'm all for it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in  Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you  just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's  their view.</p><p> But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right.  Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's (ph) on the other  side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States.  It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten  our key allies like Japan or Great Britain.</p><p> Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with  Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting  a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin? </p><p> And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the  territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is  very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very  many people, it turns out. </p><p> So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In  Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ROBERT WARNER, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRATIC  PARTY MEMBER, VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR OF THE  SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Vladimir Putin policies almost being  parroted by Donald Trump. You had Trump say only nice things about Putin.  He never spoke ill about Russia.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States  Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our  enemies. </p><p> So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if  he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with  prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have  spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer.</p><p> Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional  dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian  spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political  positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.</p><p> Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and  this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the  permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent  from their agenda. That's what this is.</p><p> And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd  know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader  gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so  those agencies try to put him in jail.</p><p> It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former  FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking  in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous  country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to,  \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread  our democratic ideals.\"</p><p> So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most  important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all  costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No  wonder Max Boot is on board with this.</p><p> Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too.  They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly  reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause  brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.</p><p> No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly  Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have  determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that.  The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian  crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak (ph) crickets. Whatever!</p><p> The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on.  They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline.  Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying  that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did. </p><p> Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: Well Kristy (ph), the President's tweet trying to make  the case that he's not a Russian asset really just undercuts his own  defense. The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was  written by Putin himself. </p><p> Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting  past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their  actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission. </p><p> Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly  what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just  making Russia's job easier.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: You say you're not a Russian agent, therefore, you're a Russian  agent. Who puts these people on TV? That's a question we should think  about. </p><p> Over the weekend, speaking of television, CNN President Jeff Zucker  declared that anyone who isn't spreading fear of Russia is doing the  bidding of Russia. Now, Zucker didn't say that himself, of course. He  rarely speaks in public. Instead, he sent his marionette out, as he often  does, to deliver the message.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN'S RELIABLE  SOURCES HOST, FORMER MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, FORMER  TVNEWSER  EDITOR: I was watching Good Morning America this weekend. And both  mornings, they led with snowstorms and scares at malls and other stories,  and not this. </p><p> And I - I just keep wondering if - if the public is ill-served, if we don't  make it really clear what the stakes of this story are. How - how can a  morning show not lead with this drama, I guess is what I'm saying.</p><p> CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: I think - I think plenty  of times we lead with - with this drama.</p><p> STELTER: OK. Well, I agree.</p><p> BERNSTEIN: And - and - and with--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So the eunuch (ph) heads to the steps of the palace and reads the  proclamation. Message received, thank you very much.</p><p> But take three steps back. Is the media's problem really that it doesn't  talk about Russia enough? Doesn't seem like that's the problem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the President was working for Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was secretly working on behalf  of Russia.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER CHARLES CUOMO, TELEVISION JOURNALIST, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Whether  the President was secretly working with Russia against America.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of the  Russians.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So whether President Trump was working on behalf of  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working on Russia's behalf.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether the sitting President was secretly working for  Russia.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether President Trump was working for Russia from The  Oval Office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes,  it's the DNC.  You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise,  Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is,  does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is  doing the bidding of Russia? </p><p> I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's  say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American  interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive  foreign wars. </p><p> You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made  America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say,  Syria and Libya? </p><p> You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S.  to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American  government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the  name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.</p><p> Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S.  would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state.  Their economy is dependent on energy.</p><p> But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done  just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my  lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil  and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not.</p><p> Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones  pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and  gas wells across the nation. Huh! </p><p> Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so  many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the  task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical  transparency.</p><p> Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of  Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly  didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read  by the federal government, on what basis? </p><p> We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it.  He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the  Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa  Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials.</p><p> Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for  reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And  we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the  reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. </p><p> They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New  York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information  when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents  might embarrass the FBI.</p><p> This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this  country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of  federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government,  bring in some sunlight. </p><p> Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them,  and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected  leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the  people, and not the other way around.</p><p> The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his  own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him  a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have.</p><p> Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District  of New York, and he joins us tonight. </p><p> Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The  Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like  FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an  appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?</p><p> ANDREW MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, FORMER ASSISTANT  UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: No, it's not,  Tucker. It's not a - appropriate pretext for the FBI for any investigation. </p><p> And I must say that, you know, listening to your monologue, it occurs to me  that, you know, since the Soviet Union fell, it's been the purpose of this  government it seems, under administrations of both parties, to treat Russia  as if it were England.</p><p> And I remember, you know, the Obama debate with Mitt Romney where, you  know, Romney suggested that Russia was a geopolitical, our greatest  geopolitical enemy, and Obama mocked him for that. Obama--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --on a - in a conversation with Medvedev, who is basically the  cat's paw for Putin, you know, says thinking he's not being heard, you  know, as soon as I get by this election, I'll have more flexibility. I -  imagine if Trump had said these sorts of things.</p><p> But I - I must say, listening to all that, it - it seems like Trump is the  guy who was left without a chair when the music stopped, because all of a  sudden, everything that was regular and fine is now, you know, now - now  Trump is - I'm sorry, Russia's back to being, you know, I guess we're back  in the Cold War.</p><p> And look, I - I think I probably find Russia to be more of a threat than  you do.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MCCARTHY: But the FBI is not supposed to be doing policy. That's not their  job.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean why was there no - but and there's a lot that we don't  know. But from that story, and no one has contested the basic facts that I  have seen, officials in the FBI sat down and decided it is unacceptable for  an elect - elected leader to come to these policy conclusions therefore,  there must be some sinister motive. </p><p> Why did no one in the FBI say, \"Wait a second. This is demonstrably not our  job. We're not allowed to do this.\"</p><p> MCCARTHY: Because they didn't start doing it in May 2017. In May 2017,  Tucker, all they did was, as a formal paper matter, they opened an  investigation, specifically, on Trump. But it was the same investigation  that had been being conducted for a year.</p><p> I keep going back to this - the Steele dossier. You've - you mentioned the  warrant that they got on Carter Page. That was mainly on the Steele  dossier. The Steele dossier is not about Carter Page, and it's not even  about prostitutes in a - in a Moscow hotel. The theory of the--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --of the Steele dossier is that Trump and Russia, Trump and the  Kremlin, Trump, personally, and the Kremlin, are in a conspiracy, an  espionage conspiracy to subvert the election, so that Trump can get in and  do Russia's bidding. That was what they went to the FISA Court with in  order to get a warrant on Carter Page.</p><p> So, the theory behind this, if you look at the - the - the Steele dossier,  guys like Page and Manafort and Cohen, they're sort of the emissaries  between the Trump side of the conspiracy and the Kremlin side of the  conspiracy, but the - the whole thing's about Trump, and it was always--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> MCCARTHY: --about Trump. And all that happened in May of 2017 is they went  overt in their files on something that they had been covertly doing for  over a year.</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's - that's such a - you are the only one I've heard make  that point. It's a really smart point. Andy McCarthy, thank you very much  for that, over a year, unbelievable.</p><p> MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer, and a whistleblower, who  knows the federal government very well through hard experience. John,  thanks very much for coming on tonight. Does this--</p><p> JOHN CHRIS KIRIAKOU, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CIA OFFICER, READER  SUPPORTED NEWS COLUMNIST, CO-HOST OF LOUD AND CLEAR ON SPUTNIK RADIO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: --so what - what do you - so, you read that story in The New York  Times on Friday. Tell me if it ratified or contradicted what you already  believed about how government works.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Oh, no, this - this absolutely ratified what I believed about  government. First of all, Andrew McCarthy is exactly right. This is what  the FBI does. And it predates 9 - 2017 by at least a year. </p><p> Don't forget, Tucker, that the CIA has a Counterintelligence Center that  works very, very closely with the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. </p><p> So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim  Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We  should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian  spy.\"</p><p> The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s. They did it to Martin  Luther King in the 60s, to George McGovern in '72. If they don't like you,  they call you a communist or they call you a Russian dupe, and then they  let the propaganda and the press takeover.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean why would Liberals, of all people, stand by and allow that  to happen? Isn't - I mean this - wasn't this their Fever Dream that some  unaccountable cabal of bureaucrats in the national security state would  subvert democracy? Why aren't they saying something about this?</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Because they hate Donald Trump that much. They don't like the  man. They don't like his policies. And they see the only way or the best  way to unseat him as using what's - what we call the Deep State.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean, what does this mean for future presidents? I mean if - if  Kamala Harris or just pick a - pick a candidate, gets elected next time, or  the time after that, I mean can any President really believe that his or  her bureaucracy won't try to end the presidency?</p><p> KIRIAKOU: No. I - I think that's exactly what the problem is. And what we  need here is robust Congressional oversight, which we haven't had in  decades.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: It should - it should be up to the - the Senate and House  Judiciary Committees to put a stop to this kind of nonsense before it even  - it even forms its - its own life. It - they could have smothered it in--</p><p> CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: --the crib and they didn't.</p><p> CARLSON: They're cheering it on.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: John, thank you. It's great to see you, always.</p><p> KIRIAKOU: My pleasure, thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: Well the government shutdown continues. Americans bore - America's  border remains a mess, obviously. MS-13 gang members, using a legal  loophole to stay within this country's borders. That's next. Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> TEXT: HUNTING MS-13.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well a vicious MS-13 attack in New York is being blamed on  America's gaping immigration loopholes. Ramon Arevalo Lopez and Oscar  Canales Molina allegedly took part in an MS-13 assault on two New York High  School students.</p><p> Both of the alleged assailants were detained at the border in 2016. But  since they were unaccompanied minors at the time, they were allowed to  settle in this country, while awaiting deportation. </p><p> Of course, they were never deported. Nobody ever is. Without that catch and  release policy, the crime likely wouldn't have happened.</p><p> Mark Morgan was Head of the Border Patrol under President Obama. He was  dismissed by President Trump, which you should keep in mind as you listen  to him speak, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for  coming on tonight.</p><p> MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF, FORMER FBI AGENT: You bet.</p><p> CARLSON: So, is it too much to say that this is a real-world example of  what can happen if you have a dysfunctional immigration policy?</p><p> MORGAN: That's absolutely right, Tucker. And I think you said it right is  that it's about that the immigration process in this country across the  board is broke. This is a great example--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MORGAN: --American, you know, if they could look this up, the Flores  decision. The Flores decision is what mandates the United States Border  Patrol to release minor children. They only have a few amount of days. </p><p> And once they hit that, they've got to release them, regardless if they've  been properly vetted, regardless if they have a - a parent in the United  States, they have to be released into the interior United States.</p><p> CARLSON: And so, that's a judicial ruling. A - a court came up with that  decision. Could - has Congress ever acted on it? I mean, since clearly  that's crazy, why doesn't the United States Congress fix it?</p><p> MORGAN: That's a great question, Tucker, another reason why I'm breaking my  silence, because Congress could fix this in five minutes if they wanted to.  Before I was a Chief of Border Patrol, I was with the - with - with the  FBI, and I actually--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MORGAN: --supervised MS-13 Gang Force in Southern California. We used to  catch them on surveillance wires, and they would laugh. MS-13 gang members  would laugh how easy it was to go back and forth between the - the Mexico  and U.S. border.</p><p> CARLSON: So, we've had a number of debates on this show with Democrats who  say there's something bigoted about criticizing MS-13. As someone who's  actually worked to apprehend MS-13, how would you respond to that?</p><p> MORGAN: That's ridiculous. MS-13, and - and I know this may be  controversial. But when the - when the President referred to them as  animals, I - I absolutely said, \"That is correct,\" those MS-13 members.</p><p> And I can tell you, again, because I've worked it, and I've been there as a  Chief, I've been to the detention facilities where I've walked up to these  individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at  them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said, \"That is a soon- to-be MS-13 gang member.\" It's unequivocal.</p><p> CARLSON: And their - their - their victims are overwhelmingly immigrants  themselves, right?</p><p> MORGAN: That's - that's another untold story, Tucker, that I'm glad you're  talking about tonight. That's absolutely correct. That's another  incredulous thing. They absolutely prey on their own.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. So if you - if you cared, you would care about that. Mr.  Morgan, thank you very much. Mark Morgan, great to see you.</p><p> MORGAN: You bet.</p><p> CARLSON: Well California has been staying up late thinking of new ways to  make life harder for normal people, the ones who haven't moved to Idaho  yet. We'll tell you what they're doing after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many  consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because  the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that?</p><p> Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the  GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly  Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do  it?</p><p> And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's  really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal  immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who  are already here illegally.</p><p> Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They  agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a  political matter? It's worth thinking about that. </p><p> A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration  is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter  enforcement of America's immigration laws.</p><p> According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of  American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter  believe America has too many immigrants already. </p><p> And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious.  These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from  future waves of lower-skilled immigrants.</p><p> So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the  Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise  their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for  that, passionately.</p><p> One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is  better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than  having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that  question of about 60 percent.</p><p> Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic  mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the  national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political  terms.</p><p> Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to  raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That  means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home  raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it.</p><p> So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of  overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want  most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at  home? </p><p> 19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares?  Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should  have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for  once?</p><p> Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids  their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all  colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make  this a happier country.</p><p> Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live,  really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by  the day. What's happening?</p><p> Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, how about a new water tax,  Tucker? Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't said what the new water tax would cost  California residents. But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry  Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month.</p><p> That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature.  Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean  drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the  Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary  because the state has many alternate funding solutions.</p><p> And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the  proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a  new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" </p><p> Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper  receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to  make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer  specifically wants one. </p><p> Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by  the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the  businesses. Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: That'll work. Trace Gallagher, great to see you.</p><p> GALLAGHER: You too.</p><p> CARLSON: Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn, joins us tonight. You know,  sometimes Mark, you hear an idea that's so brilliant, it's a transformative  idea.</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: It's almost like when Galileo got back from stargazing and hit you  with it, you know, I can't (ph) make sense. </p><p> I was walking down Market Street today, in fact, in San Francisco, and  there are people passed out, and there's human feces all over the sidewalk,  and it occurred to me, if only they would ban paper receipts, maybe all of  this would be better.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. I - I think so. As Trace was saying, they - this - these paper  receipts con - contain a chemical called BPA, which if you eat it, in high  quantities, can call birth - could cause birth defects. </p><p> And clearly, that's why California last year had the lowest fertility rate  in its entire history because people aren't having any bar - births because  they're eating too many receipts.</p><p> If you go to a Beverly Hills restaurant, and the waiter says, \"Do you want  the curly endive salad,\" and the lady says, \"No, I'll just have the receipt  and a glass of water. Oh, no wait. I can't afford the tax on the water.  Just bring me the receipt.\"</p><p> I - I had a 40-receipt a day habit. I used to buy packs of cigarettes just  so I could eat the receipts. But I actually think - I actually think,  Tucker, there's a serious point in this. The beneficiary of this would be  the Twitter guy who also makes--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --these little square machines that you see which issue the  electronic receipts.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And if you think about it, Tucker, just as social media has meant  that news and information and knowledge is just in the hands of four or  five companies around the world now, imagine if actual money just came  under the control of the same four or five people who control social media? </p><p> I'd rather have a paper receipt than the Twitter guy controlling receipts.</p><p> CARLSON: Well OK, so but that's not actually--</p><p> STEYN: I have not that thing (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --a crazy thing to say because there are, as you know, proposals  every year to do--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --away with paper money and to make everything paperless.</p><p> STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: So, why, you know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --at a time when big tech has shown no respect for the First  Amendment, for freedom of association, really, any right at all where they  - they ape Communist China, why would we trust them to control all of our  commercial transactions?</p><p> STEYN: Because I think the same that there is now a generation of people  who think this is entirely normal. I mean I don't - I don't want to go all,  you know, electromagnetic pulse on you. </p><p> But one of the problems with that is if - if that ever does happen, we'll  be going back to the mid-19th Century, but with a population that no longer  knows what people knew in the mid-19th Century, including that it sometimes  helps to be able to have paper receipts. </p><p> It sometimes helps not to deliver more and more of the daily functioning of  the world into the same four or five companies.</p><p> CARLSON: That's so - I actually hadn't put those - those together, but I  should have. That's why we're always so grateful to have you on, Mark  Steyn, a genius.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> So, the latest FBI revelations, Friday, in The New York Times, we learned  that the bureau did not agree with the President's policy positions on  Russia, and so they accused him internally of being a spy for Russia. Hmm?  Are the Democrats OK with that? We'll ask one after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP: People doing that investigation were people that have been caught  that are known scoundrels. They're in my - I guess you could say, they're  dirty cops.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: That was the President today responding to the story on Friday  that the FBI tried to investigate him as a foreign spy. That happened. No  one contested (ph) it did. How is the Democratic Party viewing this  development? </p><p> Joining us tonight is Richard Goodstein. He's a lawyer. He advised both  Bill and Hillary Clinton. Richard, good to see you tonight.</p><p> RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Thanks for having me. Sure (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: So, here's the core of The New York Times story. The officials at  the FBI watched the President on the campaign trail in 2016. </p><p> And they watched him say, and I'm quoting now from a press conference, July  26th, I believe, 2016, in Florida, \"There's nothing I'd rather do than have  a Russia - than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right  now. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example,  Russia, I'm all for it.\"</p><p> So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and  they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you  say?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's where I think you and most Democrats disagree. As Dick  Cheney said, what the Russians did in the 2016 elections was an act of war.  This was unprecedented. You talked in your opening monologue today about  what was unprecedented about this investigation of Donald Trump.</p><p> We could spend the rest of this show, not just this segment, listing all  the things that he's done, siding with Putin in Helsinki against our  intelligence agencies.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: That's unprecedented. The list--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So but wait, let me--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --goes on.</p><p> CARLSON: --let me ask you. So, there's no question that he has a different  view from the neocon establishment in Washington, the ones that have  destroyed our country and the world, and have never gone to prison,  unfortunately, as a result of what they did. </p><p> So, he is different. There's no doubt about that. But I'm just wondering as  a kind of factual matter, is there something wrong, if I were to say on the  air, you know, I kind of - I kind of like Russia, or, you know, I think  they're a lot better than China, would that make my loyalty to America  suspect? Would that--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: But that--</p><p> CARLSON: --qualify me for an FBI investigation, would it?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No. But if you were a--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --presidential candidate and said to the public, to the  Russians, please steal from Hillary Clinton, please steal from her, that  would actually, and then, you actually knew as the intelligence agencies--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --that the Russians were stealing from her and that Trump--</p><p> CARLSON: When did--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --was using it a hundreds of times--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and we'd actually don't know what else these intercepts of--</p><p> CARLSON: We don't - we don't know. We don't know.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --we don't know. We will.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But we do know - let me ask you this, do you think that it's  within bounds for the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world to  see a politician they don't like open an investigation into whether he  committed treason, discover that he did not commit treason, file no charges  against him, and then leak the existence of that investigation to the  press?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that's - that's - that's an OK way to conduct  business within an Executive Branch? Are you comfortable with that?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well the predicate is that we - he didn't commit treason, which  is siding - aiding and abetting your enemy. Actually, I think on the public  record, we know that he kind of has, whether that rises to the level of  anybody in Congress or the public--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Look, you don't agree - no, but hold on - I'm talking about  the law enforcement. Look, you don't agree with Trump, you don't agree with  his Russia policy, I think that's fine. I have no interest in seeing the  FBI open an investigation into you for disagreeing with me because I'm not  a fascist. </p><p> But I'm just wondering if you think it's OK for a law enforcement agency to  investigate a politician whose views they disagree with, find no chargeable  evidence, and then leak the fact they investigated him, in order to  discredit him, are you comfortable with that standard? That's all I'm  asking</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well again, we - we don't know that they haven't found  chargeable evidence, one. We - until Mueller has his report--</p><p> CARLSON: Why don't they charge him?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well - well let's see what Mueller has to say, which--</p><p> CARLSON: This isn't Mueller. Wait, hold on. This isn't Mueller. He's  running a separate investigation--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: He picked it (ph) up.</p><p> CARLSON: --which is an independent--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: We actually (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on, hold on.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: It's - independent for Mueller. This was the FBI. Did they - if  they didn't find anything, is it OK even if they did find something,  shouldn't we learn about it in the filing of charges, like is it OK to  discredit politicians using a law enforcement agency? Is that - is that  cool with you?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well when you say filing of charges, I - I - I tend to agree, I  think, with you that probably prosecuting a sitting President is not  something that's considered appropriate. That's what impeachment's for.</p><p> So again, your predicate for your - your kind of assertion about misconduct  by the FBI is something I just don't, and I think most Democrats, and most  of the public, doesn't subscribe to, which is the--</p><p> CARLSON: So - so - so it's OK? I just want to know like what's the standard  going forward? So, President Harris three years from now will have views  that I don't agree with. If I see the FBI investigate her for having those  views--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And if she is consorting--</p><p> CARLSON: --for being too close to Uzbekistan or whatever--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --but they don't charge her but then they leak that they thought  maybe she was a quisling, that's totally fine. It's not a big deal.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And if Uzbekistan had the way to change the United States  elections, and she consorted with them, and her son did, and her son-in-law  did, and other - and her Campaign Chairman was an aide to the Uzbekistan--</p><p> CARLSON: Wow.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --government, yes, and - and actually change the platform of the  Democratic Party--</p><p> CARLSON: Change the platform?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --to - to help the Uzbekistan, yes, actually--</p><p> CARLSON: It's - it's OK--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --they - they might (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on. It's OK - can I just ask (ph) one last question. Is it  - do you think it's moral for the - for me as a parent, for example, to  say, I don't think that my son should fight for the territorial integrity  of Ukraine, or am I somehow working for Putin, if I think that?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Look, Tucker, people have different views as to what's the  standard by which their people - their - their flesh and blood should be  committed to the defense of the United States.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But so - so--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Some people in (ph) the military--</p><p> CARLSON: --why should I care? Why should I care about--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why we should care if the--</p><p> CARLSON: --whether Russia invades Ukraine? I mean I'm not against--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why.</p><p> CARLSON: --Ukraine. I'm just saying like why - I'm an American. Why do I  care?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Here's why. Be - because if you--</p><p> CARLSON: Remind me.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --if you look at the Russian press, I think they're coming to  believe that Donald Trump is, sorry, a stooge and, therefore, they can get  away with things in Ukraine in--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But - but why do I care, just super quick--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --right in Afghanistan--</p><p> CARLSON: --tell me why I care if they take over Ukraine? I'm not - I'm not- -</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Be - because and that's testing with (ph) Europe and--</p><p> CARLSON: --calling for invasion of Ukraine but--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well, again, you're--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, so they're going to - they're going to invade Liechtenstein  next like this is not--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, it's not Liechtenstein, actually--</p><p> CARLSON: --settling, you can (ph) hear yourself?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --I--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --I think they're trying to - we - we know that they're meddling  in Brexit--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and these elections in France and elsewhere. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, they're (ph) invading England. OK, OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, they're doing it.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Richard, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, see you.</p><p> CARLSON: We're still waiting breathlessly, of course, for the release of  the Mueller report. For some, the final import (ph) is anticipated like The  Rapture, a religious event that will expose and destroy the Incubus that is  Donald Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIETTE KAYYEM, BUSINESSPERSON, AUTHOR, HOST OF THE WGBH PODCAST THE SCIF,  CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I personally think that what Mueller is  heading to, is not only the indictments, because remember, there maybe  more, right.</p><p> He's not going to, you know, he's going to, there - there may be more  coming down the pike.</p><p> ANA CABRERA, JOURNALIST, CNN TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p> KAYYEM: But also a report that discloses the extent to which Trump and his  family are compromised by the Russians.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Compromised! How do I get to be a CNN analyst? Low bar, obviously. </p><p> Others though are more cautious that one - Mueller's report could be a  disappointment in the end.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: People who are  closest to - to what Mueller has been doing of, interacting with the  Special Counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti- climactic.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Ken Starr is a former Independent Counsel, of course. He's the  Author of the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation, and he  joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on, Judge. So--</p><p> KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES  CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not sure which I'm rooting for, the anti-climactic version  of the report or the report that actually answers the questions  outstanding. </p><p> But if it turns out the report does not find the President colluded with  Russia, and goes in another direction, shouldn't Mueller offer some kind of  apology for gumming up the wheels of government for two years and  destroying public - I'm serious, and destroying public confidence--</p><p> STARR: No, I know you are. I know you are, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --in every institution this country has?</p><p> STARR: I - I understand, Tucker. I have a different view. And that view is  that Mueller should bring this to a close. We've needed to know the answer  about collusion for a long time. And I think he knows that answer. </p><p> And I wish we would know that pretty darn soon because that goes to the  heart of American politics etcetera several roles (ph) our relationships  with Russia. But here's why I'm not subscribing to the anti-Mueller view.</p><p> All of the Republican leadership agrees, \"Let him finish his work.\" Bill  Barr, the nominee, and who's superbly qualified is not - now saying, \"Let  him finish his work.\" And that's what I want him to do. Now--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --I will say this in addition (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But let me just say, there's no group I respect less.</p><p> STARR: Those--</p><p> CARLSON: So, that holds no water with me. I'm just wondering, as an  American, why wouldn't the interest of the country--</p><p> STARR: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --come before all of this stuff like well - how are we benefiting  from this--</p><p> STARR: I couldn't--</p><p> CARLSON: --protracted investigation?</p><p> STARR: Because Bob Mueller has been finding stuff that needed to be found  out, specifically the 13 Russian individuals and the two organizations.  You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a  very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an  indictment.</p><p> But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't  have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second  indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the  Trump Administration.</p><p> So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was  interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian  individuals, because of - of interference. </p><p> Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a  report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is,  you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people  in reports. </p><p> You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you  don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: And that's the regulation. Listen, one of the many problems, as you  know, the Independent Counsel Law under which I served is it called for  this vast report to do what? To go to the House of Representatives for  purposes of impeachment. Let's get the Justice Department out of that  business entirely.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I would say that. The deal (ph)--</p><p> STARR: House Representatives--</p><p> CARLSON: --that - right. Just leaking against people they don't like,  little, little scary, I would think.</p><p> STARR: Oh, that is terrible. In fact--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STARR: --let me comment on that, if I may, very briefly. When--</p><p> CARLSON: Very quickly, if you would, yes.</p><p> STARR: --when I read The New York Times article, my first reaction was we  need an investigation right now as to who leaked this. We think we know.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STARR: What was their motivation, and why the timing? This was many months  ago. There's been--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --no suggestion whatsoever of - to support this outrageous charge  against the President.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. It's pretty scary. Ken Starr, thank you very much.</p><p> STARR: My pleasure, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is running for president as a Democrat.  Some of her foreign policy views diverge from those of official Washington,  so they're trying to destroy and defame her.</p><p> Huh! Interesting! We've got details after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: It's been close to two months now. But the Yellow Jacket - Yellow  Vests, rather, protests in France are still going on. In some ways, they're  getting bigger. They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight  global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras.</p><p> The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed  about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think  global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. </p><p> Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to  impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in  Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a  scam. Let's just be honest about it.  Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they  actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal  of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. </p><p> This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its  own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in  city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. </p><p> Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for  the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their  governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as  their top priority. </p><p>America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country  are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa,  screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why  not knock over a speed camera or two?</p><p> Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you  might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight  the system. They fight to preserve it.</p><p> Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced  that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been  savaged by the Left.</p><p> Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of  Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that  country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage  in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other  major Democrat opposed gay marriage.</p><p> So, what is this really about?</p><p> Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about.  He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a  defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. </p><p> But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to  be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?</p><p> GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT CO-FOUNDER, LAWYER, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: So,  yes, I'm not a - a - a supporter of Congresswoman Gabbard's candidacy.  There are some really legitimate and serious concerns that I have that have  been raised by the real Left, not the Democratic Party Liberals--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GREENWALD: --about some of her support for the war on terror, her - her -  her affinity for Hindu nationalism in India, her affection for some really  terrible dictators that I think she should answer for, and be - be clear  about. </p><p> But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she  resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie  Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then  supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that.</p><p> But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington  orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we  continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria,  and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we  do in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington  Consensus. She's hard to put into a Liberal or a Conservative or a Right- wing or a Left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the  most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers.</p><p> CARLSON: But there's something so stealthy and feline and dishonest about  the way they're attacking her. If you don't like her foreign policy views,  then let's just say so. But no one ever really wants to debate what our  foreign policy should be. They just attack anybody who deviates from their  own dumb ideas. Have you noticed this?</p><p> GREENWALD: Yes. Well so, I think there's one particular smear that has  become extremely pervasive in U.S. discourse that is central to sustaining  the United States as a country that's at endless war, which is if you don't  support a particular war that Washington wants, to remove a particular  leader, you get accused of being a supporter of that Dictator.</p><p> In 2002 and '03--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> GREENWALD: --people who were against the Iraq War were accused often on  this network but others as well--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, sure.</p><p> GREENWALD: --ridiculously accused of - of - of loving Saddam Hussein.  People who - who opposed the intervention in Libya in 2011 were accused of  being apologists for Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p> And now, Tulsi Gabbard is being accused of being a supporter of someone  that she actually called a brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, because she's  asking why it is that we are spending a billion dollars a year, or were  arming rebels, who we don't know, trying to remove the leader of a foreign  country, and engaging in all kinds of policies that are actually worsening  the security of the United States rather than helping them.</p><p> You can criticize her. But to accuse her of being a supporter of - or a  best friend of, as Claire McCaskill put it, Bashar al-Assad is just  idiotic, but it's really toxic as well because it's the kind of argument--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GREENWALD: --hauled out always to defend Washington foreign policy.</p><p> CARLSON: It's the kind of argument that ends the argument, and that's the  point. Glenn Greenwald, thank you always for your incisive views on that.</p><p> GREENWALD: Good to be here, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back, have no fear, tomorrow  night, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity,  smugness, and groupthink. We hope you'll join us then. </p><p> Have a great evening, meantime. Guess who's next? You guessed it. And we're  going to throw to him nine seconds early, Sean Hannity. He's standing by in  New York.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY- HOST: This has become an issue. People say how many seconds  extra did Tucker steal from your show? Now - good to see. Great show as  always.</p><p> CARLSON: It's an act of love, Sean. Thank you.</p><p> HANNITY: Greenwald's an interesting guy. I like that.</p><p> CARLSON: He is an interesting guy.

The FBI wants to perform mass surveillance of big social platforms but leaves many unanswered questions about what it might entail, and how it can achieve its goals without infringing people's civil liberties. The mass shootings[1] that took place a little over a week ago sparked intense, but also contradictory reactions from Trump's administration. </p><p>On one hand, the White House wants the help of big tech companies to craft a tool that harvests information from social platforms to predict any possible threats. On the other hand, Trump expressed the administration's plans to punish the same platforms for perceived bias - something he first hinted at last year when he singled out Google for its left-leaning search results[2]. The Wall Street Journal says the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now planning to start an aggressive data collection from social platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, which also seems to clash with their respective privacy policies[3]. Facebook, in particular, has to comply with several restrictions as part of a deal[4] with the FTC, which have to do with the way it can collect and process user data moving forward.The FBI is asking[5] for proposals from third party vendors for a \"social media early alerting tool to mitigate multifaceted threats.\" The technical solution will be used to \"proactively identify and reactively monitor threats to the United States and its interests.\" The request was made a few weeks before the recent shootings that took place in Texas and Ohio, and vendors have until the end of this month to submit their proposals.A Twitter spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that its privacy policy explicitly prohibits the use of user data \"by any entity for surveillance purposes, or in any other way that would be inconsistent with our users' reasonable expectations of privacy. Period.'Judging by the wording of the request, the agency only seeks to gather publicly available data and intends to do so while respecting civil liberties and privacy safeguards. The FBI says it would collect the names, pictures, and IDs from public profiles and combine them with information from other sources and algorithms that flag specific keywords in social interactions. Big tech platforms hold a lot of user data that AI tools can sift through more quickly than humans ever could, but algorithmic threat detection could lead to a lot of false positives. The FBI says the alerts would be processed by dedicated teams of people that would also be able to adjust their frequency.Meanwhile, the White House is circulating a draft of a new executive order[6] that will give the Federal Communications Commission the power to oversee large online platforms and ensure they are moderated in a politically neutral way. This could also mean that said companies would be held responsible for user contributions - something that they were able to avoid so far thanks to a 1996 law that shielded them from such responsibilities.

Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  April 11th.  Your top stories at 6a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Stocks surging, the Dow climbing more than 400 points yesterday after  China's President Xi Jinping promised an open market and to cut tariffs on  auto imports.  Futures are showing this, 400 plus point gain on the Dow  Futures on the Dow yesterday.  Ninety point loss on the Dow Futures today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe, stocks there mostly lower.  Across the board losses in England,  France, and Germany, although slight.  And it was mixed reaction in Asia  overnight with gains in Shanghai and on the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> One of the top winners yesterday, Facebook shares seeing their biggest gain  in two years, up about four and a half percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg did  an admirable job facing a grilling on Capitol Hill from people who clearly  didn't understand Facebook, some of them.  He was grilled on everything,  from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian election interference, you  name it, he was asked it, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens  here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What Mark Zuckerberg's testimony could mean for future  regulation in the tech sector, that's ahead.  He's back on Capitol Hill at  10:00a.m. this morning.  </p><p> Nunes fighting back, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee set  to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director  Christopher Wray as the Justice Department still refuses to provide him  with an unredacted document showing the justification for their Russia  probe.  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol, that's ahead.</p><p>Bank of America changing its stance on firearms.  The bank says it will no  longer lend money to companies that make so-called assault rifles for  civilians.  </p><p> Plus, never give up on your dreams, after spending 10 years in the  development league, on basketball player delivers a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  The incredible story coming up.</p><p> And one small step for man, one giant leap online, NASA helping you channel  your inner Neil Armstrong with a brand new virtual tour of the moon.</p><p> All of that coming up and so much more this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  FOX Business's Connell McShane.  And Kairos  Founder, Ankur Jain.  Ankur, just really quickly, what was your take on  Zuckerberg yesterday?</p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I'm going to tell you, Mark did a great job.   I mean, all things considered.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love how you refer to him by his first name.</p><p> JAIN:  But I mean look, I got to tell you, the good thing was I think that  Zuckerberg did a great job for Facebook.  I think the challenge that the  congressmen had no idea what to ask to actually address the problem, and  that's a challenge.  This is an important topic.  And if you're going to  have the Senate sitting there taking the time to figure out what  regulations technology need, they need to know the right questions asked.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, right.  We have another episode of old  people talking technology at 10:00 this morning, right?  They had no idea  how to follow-up was the main point.  </p><p> JAIN:  I mean, honestly some of other was just a lack of understanding what  Facebook is.  Somebody -- I forget which one of the congressman held up a  poster board of five Facebook groups and goes, \"Mr. Zuckerberg, are you --  can you authenticate that these were not owned by Russian trolls?\"</p><p> If I were him, I would have been like, \"There are three billion groups.  I  don't remember every single group.\"  I mean, it's just --</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> JAIN:  It's just a shame.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He was prepped.  He bought the kind of legal prep that billions  of dollars can buy, put it that way.  And he followed the script that was  handed to him, we'll get into that.  That's what we're talking about, the  top of the show.  </p><p> And coming up this morning, Texas Congressman, House Financial Services  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Texas Congressman Ted Poe.  Former  Presidential Candidate Herman Cain.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  And Dr. Mike, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski on the snake diet,  yes, that's one of our things that we'll be discussing with Dr. Mike.</p><p> But to our top story this hour, Mark Zuckerberg squaring off with lawmakers  on Capitol Hill, the Facebook CEO testifying for about five hours before  skeptical senators who demanded answers on how the social media company  allowed Cambridge Analytica to misuse the personal data up to 87 million  Facebook users.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. DICK DUBIN (D), ILLINIOS, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel  you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> DUBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p> DUBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, (INAUDIBLE) in modern  America, \"connecting people around the world.\"</p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:   Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today and I say this  gently, your user agreement sucks.  You can spot me 75 IQ points, if I can  figure that, you can figure that.  The purpose of that user agreement is to  cover Facebook's rear-end, it's not to inform your users about their  rights. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investors did react positively to Zuckerberg's performance.   Shares of the social media company were up four and a half percent.  Mark  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning.  He is set to testify  before House lawmakers.</p><p> Joining us now, Gabelli Multimedia Trust Portfolio Manager, Larry Haverty.   Larry, my takeaway if -- looking at it from a market perspective and in an  investor perspective is, even without additional regulations which might be  coming, Facebook's going to be spending a lot more money on security, on  policing the content on that social media platform.  Is that fully factored  into the stock, their increase in expenses?</p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST:  Well I think  that's the $64,000 question here.  There are two context that I think this  discussion needs to be framed in.  </p><p> The first is the emotional context and that was the theater that the  Congressional grilling provided for viewers yesterday.  Five hours is an  awfully long time and I think Mark did very, very well on that.  I'd give  him an A- grade.  I thought the best answer was the hotel one and I think - - I thought he gave the wrong answer when I heard it but then I thought  maybe it was the right answer because he does need to maintain his personal  security and frankly, it isn't anyone's real business where he stays.</p><p> The second question remains answer -- unanswered though and that's the  financial question.  And you look at what Facebook's doing, they've said  they're going to add 5,000 people, that's a good crowd for a small college  basketball game.  Those people are going to need facilities, I think that's  at least a $1 billion cost, that raises the cost based on Facebook by a  very significant amount.</p><p> Now, this is a company with very, very strong margins.  My guess is that  the margins are going to go down at least 500 points but I think we have to  wait two weeks to more or less figure this out when Facebook reports its  first quarter and I'm pretty sure if the people gave Zuckerberg the advice  they did and he performed as well as he did, the crisis managers are going  to tell them how to handle the earnings release which I think is to be  upfront with the cost on this as much as possible and I think that's not a  hundred percent, they're not going to know until probably a year later how  much they spent.</p><p> They'll clearly be a significant one-time charge but with $41 billion,  that's not a big deal.  Net-net, the stock had been in my opinion, if  nothing went wrong and clearly that's no longer the case.  The stock had  been priced very cheaply relative to its growth and I think it can handle  this once the computers that are trained especially in technology  investments to detest the margin contraction get few -- get through with  selling the stock the minute the numbers come out because I think there  will be margin pressure greater than people expect and I think once the  numbers come out, the first trade will be down on the stock in a couple  weeks.  So --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, what was your take yesterday on what happened?</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Well I think the stock  was up because this could have been just a relief rally or maybe it was a  short selling -- a short squeeze, excuse me.</p><p> Larry, I'd love to get your take though, when I think about Facebook, I  wonder about the future of this company because you have Mark Zuckerberg  out there talking to the press saying and -- to senators saying that,  \"Look, we are kind of like a media company, you are seeing expense going  up, you're going to see margin compression.\"  Trading at 22 times, yes,  that's a huge discount to its historical average but it's still premium to  media companies.  Where is this company going to evolve to?  You've got  Sheryl and Mark talking about paid subscription services, what is the  future of Facebook and what's the right valuation to value that?</p><p> HAVERTY:  Oh, I think the secret sauce here is very important and that's  the first thing I learned about this company and mercifully I learned it  before it went public from talking with some people who did business with  the company.  </p><p> The advertising works and it's very unique.  You have David Ogilvy, one of  the advertising gurus historically 50 percent of advertising works, I just  don't know which 50 percent.  Facebook can prove its efficacy, it's more  efficient than alternatives.  So advertisers, unless there are real, real  major problems are going to embrace it.  They're not going to walk away.  A  few may walk away, my guess is maybe you lose two to three percent on add  volume, you're clearly going to have cautious CPM pricing for the next 12  months and then I think the systems will write themselves but this company  has a tremendous comparative advantage versus comp.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  CPM being called for million (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HAVERTY:  Tremendous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cost for thousand views (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HAVERTY:  Yes, cost for thousand.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get your take on what you heard about regulation from  these senators yesterday because it's not going to be just Facebook.  As an  entrepreneur, are you worried about Washington getting in the way of  innovation and creation?</p><p> JAIN:  So I think -- look, let's break it out.  One, Zuck said himself that  Facebook is open to the right kind of regulation.  I think secondly, it's  really not the Facebook problem, right?  I mean, Google has as much or more  data on users than Facebook does.</p><p> The question is, what's the right kind of regulation?  After watching the  Congress yesterday ask their questions, I worry that if they're left to  create regulation it will do things that stifle innovation and actually  block the services that actual people --</p><p> MCSHANE:  We never got to that question about what the -- I mean, maybe we  did.  I mean, to the entire -- to whatever else, five or six hours but what  I saw, it never got to your question which is what is the right type of  regulation.  </p><p> I think Kamala Harris, the senator from California maybe came closest and  she tried to press him, I think it was in the 6:00 hour Eastern Time  talking about Cambridge Analytica data breach.  It's like, why didn't you  tell the users about that?  He's like, \"We know that they are taking our  data, we know they're using it for advertising to make it more targeted.\"   But once there's a breach, why weren't the users told about that and what  type of regulation can help prevent that in the future?  And he dodged.</p><p> JAIN:  I think the common theme you saw throughout Zuck's testimony was  transparency.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> JAIN:  And I think that is ultimately where the right regulation goes, is  that as long as these companies are transparent about what they're doing  with data, what's happening with the data, I think at that point, the  user's decisions on how much they want to give Facebook, how much they want  to use Facebook, et cetera.  And so, hopefully the Congress will lean  towards that kind of regulation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I will end on this note, one, Sheryl Sandberg needs the same  kind of grilling from the legal team that Mark Zuckerberg does because,  again, her kind of like flip hair-toss reaction to what's been going on at  Facebook for the last decade is a little dismissive to investors and two,  what was ironic was listening to those senators asks Mark Zuckerberg those  questions was the equivalent of watching my 82-year-old father try to use  Facebook.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That he was like -- it was the equivalent of like flicking the  phone like there's a bug on it and then dimming the screen to the point  that he throws the phone at you and tells you he -- that Facebook broke his  phone, that's what it felt like.</p><p> JAIN:  If Facebook does have access to people's car records, I'd love for  them to release how many Congressmen called their grandkids that morning  and say, \"Can you please quickly walk me through Facebook before I  interview this Mark guy.\"  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  It's embarrassing.  A bunch of times it's embarrassing.  It  was -- I mean, it's almost like when we do an interview with someone, you - - a lot of times you know the subject, you're ready to follow-up like this.   But if you're not -- if you don't know the topic, you can ask the first  question, forget about the follow-ups and that was -- what happened a ton  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But fear the wiley southerner because I think Lindsey Graham  acted all folksy and very foghorn leghorn but then he backed Mark into  trying to basically asking him if you have a monopoly.  And so I thought  that he used -- he was like, \"Go ahead, assume that I'm stupid because I'm  from the south\" and then he went in for the kill shot.</p><p> JAIN:  It was definitely smart at some point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you Ankur.  Larry, it was great to have you here,  terrific analysis as always, please come back very, very soon Larry  Haverty.</p><p> HAVERTY:  Thanks a lot.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And keep it here on FOX Business for live coverage of Mark  Zuckerberg's testimony before House lawmakers today, starts at 10:00a.m.  Eastern Time.  </p><p> Meantime, Bank of America's big move against guns, the bank won't lend to  companies that make so-called assault weapons for civilian use.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p> And time is up, House Intel share Devin Nunes is done waiting for the FBI  and DOJ to hand over Russia probe documents.  And now he says it's time for  someone at the top to face serious consequences.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sprint and T-Mobile talking about a merger again.  Cheryl Casone  has the detail, Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, really Dagen.  The third fourth largest  U.S. wireless carriers are back in the negotiating table again.  The merger  would lump together 127 million customers and get some serious competition  to Verizon and AT&amp;T, that nation's top two providers.</p><p>T-mobile and Sprint were in talks before but those ended because the  (INAUDIBLE) valuation disagreements between the two companies.  Since then,  Sprint stock has taken a dive, it lost about a fifth of its value.  The  company has long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Shares of T-mobile  are also down nearly six percent year-to-date.  So, we shall see.</p><p> Theranos is making some major job cuts, report say the blood testing firm  laying off almost everybody that works there in an effort to keep the  company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoffs chopped the company's  workforce from 125 to about two dozen employees, that is way down from  2015, they had 800 people there at the time.  Founder and CEO Elizabeth  Homes has announced the staffing changes nearly a month after settling  civil fraud charges with the SEC which forced her to give a voting control  over her own company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p> Well, WalletHub has released its annual list of best places to live for  millennials.  Here are the top three states, Minnesota ranked high on the  list coming in at number three.  North Dakota coming in at number two,  these are very cool places.  And then get this, the top spot not  technically a state but it's the nation's capital.  According to the study,  Washington, D.C. the best place for millennials to live.</p><p> Millennials make up 35 percent of D.C.'s workforce, key indicators of  living standards like average monthly earnings for millennials and, of  course, the unemployment rate for them were looked at.  D.C. millennials  say that the abundance of people their age is also a big attraction for  moving there.  So, staying with the younger generation, looks like young  adults, the share of them that are living with their parents is right now  at the highest in 75 years.  This is depressing parents.  </p><p> A few research center study found that 33 percent of 25 to 29-year-olds  live with their parents or their grandparents in 2016, that's almost three  times as many that live with their parents, Dagen, in 1970.  I don't know  about you, but when I was 18, I got out of high school my parents were  like, \"Bye, good luck.  Take care.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  My dad gave me $20 when I graduated from college and said,  \"Hey kiddo, I can't find you a job.  If you get married, here's $20, elope,  I don't want to know about it.\"  Said, \"That's a dowry.\"</p><p> CASONE:  Same story, yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Is that exactly what you did?</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No -- yes, actually, about 10 years later.  Thanks Collin for  bringing up that happy memory.  Think of -- what do you think of  millennials living at home?</p><p> JAIN:  Oh, rent is so expensive nowadays.  I mean, this is the problem.   Like you're spending 55, 60 percent of your income in New York on rent,  it's no surprise people were staying at home.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You actually have backed a company that's trying to connect the  -- that's trying to ease the down -- the -- not the down payment but the  security deposit.</p><p> JAIN:  Right.  So actually, one of our biggest focuses right now at Kairos  is building new technologies to help reduce the cost of rent.  The one  you're talking about is Rhino.</p><p> One of the problems of renting is not just the monthly recurring cost, just  to move in to a place, you're spending $10,000 plus.  Nobody has that kind  of liquid cash coming out of college.  So we basically created a company  that waive security deposits for folks.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  I just moved and it's been a pain in the butt with all upfront  cost and then you have to buy furniture and different things like that,  find a new gym and --</p><p> JAIN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I suspect you saw that list to the best places for millennials  to live, Minnesota and North Dakota is because the cost of living is so  low.  </p><p> JAIN:  Actually, I also got to find that list.  I don't know who came up  with that.</p><p> BELL:  Well D.C., the technology corridor could be potential driver. </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's true, it's not just politics.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you're an entrepreneur encore, you can start a business  anywhere, even in North Dakota.  </p><p> JAIN:  I agree with you.  I mean, I just think -- I will be shocked if you  surveyed a random poll of millennials and that that was the order of  favorite cities.</p><p> MCSHANE:  The good shell oil start-up in North Dakota.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Again, the future.  Coming up, all options on the  table, that's the word from the White House as the president looks to show  force against Syria.  </p><p> And you'll be digging deeper this summer to drive and fill up your tank,  gas prices spiking.  We'll tell you why the real sticker shock may be from  your gas station credit card bill.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The art of a trade war, U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers squaring off.  According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. trade  officials are laying blame on Chinese firms for rerouting goods to other  countries to get around tariffs.</p><p> And this coming after China said it would open market and ease some import  tariffs particularly on auto imports.  Futures are looking like this this  morning, again, the selloff is picking up steam, it was a great day for  stocks yesterday.  We have a 181 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p> Joining me from the CME Group, the PRICE Futures Group and FOX News  Contributor, Phil Flynn.  What do you make of this latest development Phil?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think when we're looking at the  difficulties of actually enforcing a potential trade war when it comes to  transshipping.  And if you look at the markets today, we're really trying  to balance the reducing risk of a trade war versus a rising risk of a real  war in Syria.</p><p> So you have a lot of dynamics to play with the markets, a lot of  nervousness.  But actually, I guess I have to say that President Donald  Trump strong line with China appears to be bearing fruit.  And overnight,  of course, President Trump tweeted and basically thanked President Jinping  from China for his kind words on the tariffs and talking about his problems  with intellectual property.  So it looks like President Trump's strong arm  has -- bearing some fruit this morning.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, it's interesting Phil the President Xi's comments, how they  worked into markets yesterday and then no doubt played a role especially in  the stock market in the gains we saw and you're right, we got a talk coming  up I think about Syria that maybe that hasn't affect on today's selloff  that we're seeing.</p><p> But do you think President Xi knew exactly what he was doing there?  In  other words, this is going to be a long drawn out process, these  negotiations and he -- I would bet that he knew by saying what he said that  the markets would react as they react, maybe buys him a little bit of time  too to negotiate.</p><p> FLYNN:  I think he did.  I think he wanted to lower the temperature a  little bit.  If you remember China started the week off really tough,  putting sanctions on U.S. soybeans which was basically their nuclear  options.</p><p> I think President Xi wanted to ratchet down the tensions and basically give  up on what he knows is indefensible.  I think everybody in the world  realizes that the Chinese import tariffs on cars is way out of whack, the  entire world knows that that's indefensible.  The stealing of intellectual  property, everybody's against that.  Everybody knows that China is playing  fast and loose with the rules.</p><p> So I think on the things that were indefensible, he's going to come out and  try to adjust their position and I think it does open the doors for  negotiations and there probably will be no trade war.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  From your mouth Phil, thank you so much.  Phil Flynn from CME  Group, we'll see you soon.</p><p> Serious action for Syria, the president weighing a massive military strike  and what that would mean for the United States and our relationship -- our  tense relationship with Russia.  </p><p> And forget Sci-Fi images of the surface of the moon, there's a new 4K view  of the planet that you will not be able to take your eyes off of, that's  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure this morning, we have 179-point loss on the Dow Futures, a  weaker open for stocks is on deck.  Investors are waiting on inflation data  and minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, coming out later today,  maybe its concerns about Syria and a strike, an impending strike.  </p><p> This, coming after a big rally yesterday, China said it would open up its  economy and makes some concessions on the tensed trade relationship the  U.S. has with China.  Checking global market action in Europe, markets are  edging lower.  And in Asia overnight, it was mixed action, the two markets  there that headed south, the Nikkei in Japan and KOSPI in South Korea.   Targeting Syria, President Trump looking to rally support for a possible  missile strike against Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We're going to  continue to work with a number of our partners and allies as we determine  what the next best steps are.  I just saw the troops yesterday.  I don't  have anything new on that front in terms of things that the President may  or may not do.  We are not going to broadcast.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This, as the United States positions warships within firing  range of Syria.  Deadline day, the FBI and justice department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to essentially spying on a  U.S. citizen, Carter Page, that counterintelligence Russia investigation.   The House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, threatening legal  action if law enforcement does not comply.  </p><p>Bank of America, taking action on guns, it will stop lending the gun makers  that produce so-called assault-style weapons for civilians.  Peak driving  season, kicking off in a few weeks, new numbers show you'll be paying more  at the pump, more on that, plus, the fresh warning for drivers over gas  station credit cards.  </p><p> A night, 10 years in the making, one NBA player debuting with a  performance, so good, it could not even have been scripted any better, we  have the highlights, and a whole new way to see space, NASA unveiling a  virtual tour of the moon.  </p><p> But, first, the Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike on Syria, the prospects for U.S. action, rising yesterday,  after Russia rejected a U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate the  alleged chemical weapon's attack.  White House Press Secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders weighed in yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  The President has been clear, we're working with our partners and  allies and our National Security team to look at all options and as we've  said, all options are on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of  anything the President may or may not do in response to what's taking place  in Syria.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This coming as a European air traffic control agency is  reportedly alerting airlines to exercise caution due to potential air  strike in Syria in the next three days.  Joining us now, is National  Security Analyst for the Clarion Project, Professor of Counter-Terrorism at  Liberty University, Ryan Mauro.  Ryan, you were previously a volunteer  researching for a Syria opposition group before the Civil War started.   What is your take on this?  What does the U.S. need to do here?</p><p> RYAN MAURO, PROFESSOR OF COUNTER-TERRORISM, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY:  Well, the  immediate objective is to have some type of deterrent effect on Assad, so  that the chemical weapons attacks and other forms of attacks, like the  barrel bombs, can be stopped.  </p><p> And that's very doable because he has a weak air force, we have the  capability to strike at his shipments of fuel, the stuff that's coming in  and out of the ports that the Russians have to use, so there's plenty of  targets that are vulnerable, hitting just a handful of them, would have a  dramatic effect on the ground and has to be more than punishment.  </p><p> What has to happen is that the dictator Assad has to actually look at the  situation and say, my chances of losing this war go up when I do things  like this, and therefore I'm going to stop doing it, and that's the  calculation we have to aim for.</p><p> JAIN:  Even if he has Russia on his side, preventing that?</p><p> BELL:  Russia did say, they came out this morning.  I saw a news report  that said they would retaliate, they would look to stop any missiles coming  to Syria and they would strike any places where those missiles were coming  from.</p><p> MAURO:  We've heard that every time there's been some type of confrontation  with a Russian ally, that's, kind of, just how they talk.  And if you look  at what happened with the air strike last year, we gave a warning to the  Russians.  They got their people out so that there weren't casualties.   There was an arrangement.  And giving that heads-up, doesn't really make  much of a difference if you're going after hard targets because you can't  pick those up and that's really what you're going after.</p><p> MCSHANE:  This is more aggressive than that (INAUDIBLE) what you're talking  about is a step-up from what we did last year, so there has to be more risk  involved, no?</p><p> MAURO:  There is.  Any time you have a greater number of strikes, there's a  greater number of risks, obviously, especially if it's missiles coming from  the sea and hitting these parts, especially the shipments, so that you  can't get supplies in and out, that's very doable and it's not something  that Russia's going to want the risk a war over.  Will they try to shoot  down some cruise missiles, maybe launch a cyber-attack?  Probably, because  Putin always has, at the end of the day, be able to say, look, there's a  proof that America is weak and I'm the future of the world, give him that,  you know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is the -- what is the end objective here?  Because we had  one strike on an airfield last year, there was a chlorine gas attack  earlier this year, in January, which our response was, essentially a letter  from the state department.  There was no force taken, at all, and that  sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, does it not?  So what is the end  objective to essentially take out the air force, Assad's air force here?</p><p> MAURO:  That's what I think it's going to be.  It may not be the explicit  objectives, they'll say no more planes in the sky at all, but it'll be at  least cripple it to the point where there is a difference on the ground and  that advantage is lost by Assad and that increases the pressure on him.  </p><p> And in the past, when it looked like Assad was going to lose significant  territory, the Russian tone did change, they would said, we like Assad,  he's our friend, but we are not dedicated only to him, and you would  actually have people opposed to Assad that were going over to Russia.  So,  Russia wants a puppet state, they want a military base there, and they  think Assad is a loser, they will look to somebody else.  So, I don't rule  out the possibility of cooperating with the Russians in the future, if we  handle this very carefully.</p><p> MCSHANE:  This coalition -- I'm sorry, the coalition --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what I want to ask.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  fairly easy, I mean, do you think that (INAUDIBLE) France, like  the U.K., Saudi Arabia?</p><p> MAURO:  Coalition is done.  So many people hate Assad, that that's just a  matter of few phone calls.  I am concerned of what allies we get involved  in this, like, Qatar.  As opposed an ally, that supports every enemy of  ours, Turkey, especially, Turkey always demands that we ditch our allies,  the Kurds, and their reliance that includes Christians.  </p><p> So, I get worried about the influence of these partners giving us bad  advice for their own selfish aims.  But, I think we should, particularly,  Northern Syria, double down on the Kurds and their alliance there because  you're actually seeing the beginnings of a Democratic future in that part  of Syria.  It's an amazing story that's not told.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just one last thing before we move onto another topic, but in  terms of Syria, does this mean the U.S. is not getting out of Syria, as  President Trump --again, President Trump linked that to ISIS being on the  run, but this is the most serious problem for the Syrian people, is the  leader who is still there, are we there for, maybe, even a few years to  come?</p><p> MAURO:  Oh, yes, definitely, because even if he were to go back to original  position, say look, Assad is not a concern anymore, my concern is just  ISIS.  There are terrorist groups even worse than ISIS right now, in Syria,  including Al-Qaeda which basically has an army of 20 to 25,000 people that  they've never had before, and there are other groups.  So, any foreign  policy that focuses solely on ISIS, is problematic, maybe because I see  what's coming around the corner and it could be worse.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And i was critical for years of the foreign policy in the  position of the Obama administration that they created this power vacuum  overseas and the suggestion that we are getting out of Syria would do the  very same thing.</p><p> MAURO:  And it's a terrible signal to send also, especially when you don't  have benchmarks and say, we're going to accomplish A,B, and C, before that  happens.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  I want to move on, Ryan, switch gears to back here at  home, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, calling out the  Justice Department for failing to provide an unredacted two-page document,  this is an electronic communication used to formally begin the Russia  probe, the California Congressman laying out the potential consequences  last night on the Ingraham Angle.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I did just tell you that we're not going to just hold and contempt, we will  have a plan to hold and contempt and to impeach.</p><p> LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p> NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Rob Rosenstein?</p><p> NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, your reaction to that?</p><p> MAURO:  This type of stuff drives me crazy with the government  bureaucracies, because whether they are trying to cover up something or  they're just being difficult.  This is actually a threat to our democracy.   Move beyond the issue of Trump and the politics of the day, this is the  type of thing that members of congress, researchers like myself, encounter  constantly, you ask for something reasonable.  </p><p> They refuse to give it to you, they'll fight to the death, but not give it  to you, and when you get it, it's a redacted piece of paper with, like, two  words, the and a, and then you have to go over and fight it over again.   There is a major crisis of transparency in the government that this is  touching upon beyond the politics of today with the whole probe with  Russia.</p><p> MCSHANE:  So, I wondering, though,  just listening what Nunes said there,  if there's some -- if there's some, or at least is worth questioning,  whether or not there's some aspect of Nunes during the President's bidding  here on the question over Rosenstein and the question of Christopher Wray,  the President has talked openly about in the last few days of getting rid  of, for lack of a better term.  </p><p> So, that's -- I mean, that's where -- and Nunes was talking about on a  different subject, but he said, we won't hold back, we don't go after these  guys and none of those two were related.  It's going to be interesting to  watch when you think of that though.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But if they did their job, it wouldn't be (INAUDIBLE) it was  Wray and Rosenstein, did their job and didn't act like they were, kind of,  hide something about this investigation.  It would be a moot point and you  could make that connection with President and his legal problems and what's  going within the FBI and the JOY, in terms of, well, stonewalling.</p><p> MAURO:  I agree, and just all the parties involved in this, I'm really,  greatly, disappointed because you're a supporter of the President or you're  against them.  Whoever's representing you right now, the dialogue that goes  along with it, I find to be destructive.  I mean, the morale, right now,  the FBI deal, you deal with FBI personal constantly.  I've never seen it so  low.  </p><p> And so, even from Trump's side, some of the rhetoric come seeing -- it  really does bother me when I see how that impacts people who sacrificed a  lot, not just risking their lives, but look at what this type of services  does to marriages, their families, sacrificed a lot.  </p><p> And then they'd get basically branded as an agency, as a whole, as being  politicized or corrupt.  And by the way, we're talking about classified  information, so that's why I don't make these final assessments as, oh,  what happened or didn't happen because 90 percent what you're talking  about, is not available to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> MAURO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks for being here.  You covered a lot of ground for us, Ryan  Mauro.  Coming up, brace yourself before you put the pedal to the metal.   This summer, gas prices are on the rise, but apparently not as high as the  interest on your gas station credit card, we will explain.  And hope dreams  do come true, one basketball player delivering a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  That's ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bank of America entering the gun control debate.  Cheryl Casone  has more on this story, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, they are, Dagen.  The bank it's going to stop lending to  companies that produce military-style firearms for civilian use -- an  attempt to curb mass shootings.  The bank telling gunmakers and doesn't  want to underwrite or finance these firearms.  And its told the number of  gun manufacturers that will no longer do business with them.  Shares of  Bank of America are slightly lower; down almost one percent in the  premarket. </p><p> Well, get ready to pay more at the pump this summer.  The government  estimates prices could jump as much as 14 percent to average of $2.74 a  gallon nationwide.  You can blame the expected increase on OPEC and Russia  which agreed to cut production in 2016, and those cuts have been extended  through the end of this year.  Regular gas right now hitting its price of  the year, $2.66 a gallon for the week.  Well, a new study is finding that  gas credit cards carry much higher interest rates than regular credit  cards.  Creditcards.com is reporting that average rate for gasoline credit  cards, 24 percent.  The national average for general credit card is about  17 percent.  </p><p> And flying to the moon has never been so easy and so cheap thanks to NASA.   We now have the opportunity to tour our closest neighbor in 4k high depth.   This new video shows images that have been collected over the last nine  years by NASA's lunar orbiter.  It gives us an extremely detailed look at  the moon's surface.  What's very cool?  You can see the sight of Apollo  17's rover and lunar landing -- completely, Dagen, untouched, since 1972.   So, I know you were thinking: oh, great, a cheap flight to the moon.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You know, we actually have somebody who can talk about  traveling to the moon onset.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I actually was born the year that we landed on the moon.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's incredible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know it's sad.  </p><p> JAIN:  In fact, we own a company called Moon Express and we're actually  sending the first private rockets to the moon at the end of this year, just  to get -- you're talking about regulations and tariffs and all this.  Our  primary mission to the moon is actually the mind for platinum and bring it  back.  And we had to go through so many hoops to get the White House and  Congress to approve sending anything past Earth's orbit, and the next  battle is going to be: how to bring stuff back.  So, it's all fun and games  to play around with the virtual reality of the moon, but it's going to be  really, really fun when we get to send people to the moon.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Any suggestions on who we want to send or not bring back?  </p><p> BELL:  How soon are we be doing this?</p><p> JAIN:  It's the first unmanned rocket.  Probably, at the end of the year.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's cool.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Where are you launching from?  Where's the launch?  </p><p> JAIN:  NASA actually gave us the basic Cape Canaveral, where the original  Apollo mission launch.  So, it's going to be a nice, kind of, historic  moment.  We're thinking about timing, it would be -- at 2019, next year. </p><p> MCSHANE:  yeah.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's fantastic.  Ankur, thank you for sharing that with us.  </p><p> JAIN:  Exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, it also inspires young people to be entrepreneurs and  literally reach for the star.  </p><p> Breaking news, President Trump just tweeted this: \"So much fake news about  what is going on in the White House.  Very calm and calculated with the big  focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting  and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.  Feels great to have  Bolton and Larry K. (Larry Kudlow) on board.  I (we) are doing things that  nobody thought possible despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia  investigation which takes tremendous time and focus.  No collusion or  obstruction other than I fight back.  So, now, they do the unthinkable and  raid a lawyer's office for information.  BAD!\"  All caps, exclamation  point.  </p><p> Coming up, Sister Jean's rock star status continues, despite Loyola  Chicago's heartbreaking the final four.  This time, the sister is blessing  the Chicago Cubs with the first pitch.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The L.A. Lakers are not going to the NBA playoffs but they gave  us quite a Hollywood story last night.  Jared Max is here to explain,  Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  This one reminds me  of the NBA version of the 2002 baseball movie, \"The Rookie\".  Remember  Dennis Quaid for a trade and aging pitcher, who finally got shot in big  leagues?  Andre Ingram, who spent 10 years in the NBA Developmental League,  playing in small cities, traveling often by bus to stay in the game.  At  age 32, Ingram made his NBA debut last night.  Lakers fans at Staples  Center went batty.  Ingram's story book night's on and hit his first four  shots, include the three all three points.  He shot six of eight from the  field.  Scored 19 points, blocked three shots, the crowd even chanted MVP,  MVP.  Ingram scored more points in his NBA debut than any player in the  last 50 seasons -- a dream come true.  Remember, Linsanity, Jeremy Lin, who  lit up in Knicks in the NBA six season ago.  Overnight super star from the  minor leagues, Lin tweeted: \"Anyone who has chased hoop dreams can  appreciate this, too good.\"  Playoffs start Saturday, by the way.  </p><p> Just over two months since the Alabama Crimson Tide won college football's  national championship.  The team met with President Trump yesterday at the  White House.  And forget about players protesting, Head Coach Nick Saban  reportedly held a team meeting and said we're doing this regardless of your  political beliefs.  Saban was asked if called any recruits from the White  House.  Take a listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NICK SABAN, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA:  Absolutely.  I  mean, why wouldn't I?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many?  </p><p> SABAN:  Probably half a dozen.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  From the oval?  </p><p> SABAN:  No, no, I -- from -- I get these rooms confused around here.  So,  but it was in the White House, and it was good.  But I didn't want to have  any violations if the president talks to any recruits for us.  That would  have been the NCAA would have jumped all over that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Like you hear the president say roll tide yesterday.  Changes is  coming to some NFL uniforms next season.  The color rush monochrome jerseys  we've seen teams wear on Thursday night games, last couple of seasons.  It  won't be a Thursday staples.  Teams get more flexibility now to wear these  color rush jerseys where they want, and also maybe change them.  Oh, hey,  look who threw the ceremonial first pitch yesterday at Wrigley Field?  For  the Cubs home opener along with members of the Loyola Chicago basketball  team, the NCAA Cinderella's Sister Jean, age 98, puts the ball in play.   Unfortunately, for Cubs' fans, the Pirates won.  (INAUDIBLE) the players  from Loyola squad, of course, saying the take me out to the ball game --  the tradition.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a better pitch than I've seen in some and delivered it  at games.  </p><p> BELL:  For a 98-year-old.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCSHANE:  It was a good pitch for a 98-year-old woman.  Do we have data to  compare that?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I turned to Connell.  Connell's first's job was -- he was of  baseball -- </p><p> MCSHANE:  Baseball play by play, right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's was the first --</p><p> MCSHANE:  I throw the first pitch from, and that was, yes, not as good as  Sister Jean.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Since you're here, Connell, I'm going to give you a NASCAR  story.  Kyle Busch --</p><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, come on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's warming hearts around the world.  He surprised a young fan  at an In and Out drive through.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> KYLE BUSCH, RACE CAR DRIVER, NASCAR:  Can you -- that kid in the yellow  sweatshirt right over there? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?</p><p> BUSCH:  Can you give it to him?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course.</p><p> BUSCH:  Thank you.  All right.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good job today.  </p><p> BUSCH:  I appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Dagen, so often stars, it doesn't matter what field you're in, go  running from their fans.  I love to see Kyle Busch's attitude all the time.   He wants to sign somebody's R.V., he likes to pop in and surprise people.   He saw the kid was wearing his number.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, he's wearing a Kyle Busch sweatshirt, it looks like,  because those are Kyle's color.  And he had a big win at a Texas motor  speedway over the weekend.  But again, these NASCAR drivers actually don't  get recognized.  Because they're very average looking, so.  </p><p> MAX:  No, helmets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What?</p><p> MAX:  Nothing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, no helmets.  Thank you, Jared. </p><p> MAX:  I'm up for double-double right.  I'll have an In and Out double- double burger.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How far do you have to drive for In and Out?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  California.</p><p> MAX:  I don't know.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Not bad for a 98-year-old, Jared.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jared's sports report, Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.   Still ahead, eating like a snake can help you lose weight.  That's the  theory behind a new trendy diet.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, April 11th.  </p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. eastern.</p><p> The bulls trying to fight back -- they did yesterday, a 428-point gain on  the Dow yesterday.  We had gains across the board.  The biggest mover of  those three market gauges was the Nasdaq composite gaining more than 2  percent.</p><p> Yesterday with some comment very early in the morning East Coast time from  China's President Xi Jinping who promised to open that market and cut  tariffs on auto imports.</p><p> The Dow swung more than 300 points during the trading day for the 14th  straight time marking the longest such stretch ever.</p><p> And also with some good news on Capitol Hill with Mark Zuckerberg doing an  A -- A minus, A plus job even testifying in front of those senators.</p><p> It's a different story this morning, futures are showing losses -- 177  point loss on the Dow futures right now.  Some concerns about what will  happen with Syria and when the U.S. with partners will strike.</p><p> In Europe stocks mostly lower, losses across the board there.</p><p> And it was mixed markets in Asia with Shanghai and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong but gaining half of 1 percent.</p><p> One of the top winners yesterday was, as I said, Facebook -- shares seeing  their largest gain in two years up 4.5 percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced  a grilling on Capitol Hill on everything from the Cambridge Analytica  scandal, Russian election interference, bias toward conservative news.   Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  The most important thing that I care about  right now is making sure that no one interferes in the various 2018  elections around the world.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he's set  to testify before House lawmakers.  Fox Business will bring you live  coverage starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Immigration battle -- yet another California town taking on the state,  challenging sanctuary city laws.

The new mile-high perks that  airbus is planning.</p><p> Here to break it all down with me is CFRA investment strategist Lindsay  Bell, Fox Business' Connell McShane, Kairos founder who once was an  executive at Tinder, Ankur Jain.  That's where -- I am not wrong.  He was - - </p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  No, I was there.  I was part of Tinder for a  while after signing the last company to them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So based on that, Mark Zuckerberg -- he is really -- he's an  admirable performer.  </p><p> JAIN:  He really did -- as you say, he did a great job.  I think the big  question now is do the congressmen have the ability to ask the right  questions?</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  No.</p><p> JAIN:  And if they don't are they in the right place to set the  regulations?  And if not how do the tech companies work with Congress to  make sure the right regulations get in place?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad privacy protections are the consensus there -- </p><p> JAIN:  And transparency, I think.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's been said for years.  Facebook was reckless.  They were  reckless.  They didn't protect people.  They didn't tell people how their  data was being used properly.  And now this is what happens.</p><p> JAIN:  Well, it's like -- Facebook's 14 years old, it's like when was the  last time a teenager made all the right decisions?  And I think, you know - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He tried to drop that excuse referencing his dorm room.  Come  on, move on -- Mark.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Move on.</p><p> MCSHANE:  But you don't (INAUDIBLE) outsmart these guys for one day and you  know more about your own industry than they do doesn't necessarily mean  you're going to evade regulation, long term.  I'm thinking about -- I was  covering the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case for a while and there's a lot of jokes  going back and forth among reporters that the judge didn't understand the  technology.  Well, the judge has a number of clerks that may understand the  technology.  </p><p> These Senators and congress people have a number of aides that may  understand the technology.  So that's part of this, too.</p><p> JAIN:  Anyway -- I do think that at the end of the day Facebook is open to  regulation.  So is Google, so is Apple.  So everybody wants to move this  floor in a productive way.  It's just a matter of doing it in the right  process.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well said but I would like them to cut the let's all join hands.   It's the summer love mantra coming out of Facebook.</p><p> Breaking news -- President Trump has tweeted this, moments ago on Syria,  \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready,  Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  You shouldn't  be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.\"   Strong words from President Trump.</p><p> Coming up this morning, we're going to speak with House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling; House Judiciary Committee  member Congressman Ted Poe; former Republican presidential candidate Herman  Cain will be here; and Dr. Mikhail Varshavski -- Dr. Mike.</p><p> But right here, right now we have the judge standing by to talk about one  of our top stories this morning.  We were talking about Facebook and the  testimony from Zuckerberg yesterday.  But let's talk about Facebook's role  in the Russia meddling probe. </p><p> CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed during that testimony that the tech titan is  working with Special counsel Robert Mueller.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I assume Facebook has been served with subpoenas from  special counsel Mueller's office.  Is that correct?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the  special counsel's office?  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you been interviewed?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  Let me clarify that.  I actually am not aware of  a subpoena.  I believe that there may be.  But I know we're working with  them.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me right now Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- just your thoughts.  </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well, sometimes  when the government wants information it breaks down doors like it did to  the doors of the Trump Organization at 5:30 in the morning to get to  Michael Cohen's records on the inside.  And sometimes it just says Mr.  Zuckerberg, can we speak to your people?  No search warrant, no FBI agents,  no guns drawn, no subpoena.</p><p> So I would imagine that they used a softer approach with Mr. Zuckerberg's  people than they did with Michael Cohen.  Meaning they sent some FBI agents  there to engage in what appeared to be friendly conversations about how --  tell us how you know who is placing these ads.  Are these Russians?  Are  these people who are pretending to be Americans?</p><p> Give us the technology.  Talk us through it.  And they probably willingly  did and he might be personally unfamiliar -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with the conversation.  He may think it's pursuant to a  subpoena.  My guess is it is probably just a friendly request.  The  government comes knocking and they ask you to talk to them, you can say  yes, you can say no.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But my reaction to that was I wonder if people will be upset  that without a subpoena that Facebook potentially hands over or reveals  private information that's on the network because I just go back to Apple.   And Apple fighting tooth and nail in the court system to avoid rewriting an  operating system to allow the FBI in to look at the San Bernardino killer's  phone.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My buddies at the FBI were not happy with me but I cheered  Apple on, they did the exact right thing for their customers.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- and I realize now why Apple did it.  I realize  now because now Tim Cook has two strong legs to stand on -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in terms of protecting people's privacy.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  Now, we don't know -- Senator Leahy in my view asked  the right questions.  He could have gone deeper but I don't know that Mark  Zuckerberg would have known the answer.  We don't know exactly what  information Bob Mueller's people, FBI agents, got from the Facebook team --  whether they got personal private information.</p><p> Theoretically, theoretically, if Facebook received a subpoena for Dagen  McDowell's account they would notify you to give you and your lawyers the  opportunity to negotiate the subpoena or to ask a judge to quash it.  I say  theoretically.  That doesn't always work that way.</p><p> MCSHANE:  And it didn't -- I mean it's not -- I mean it's not apples to  apples on the comparison but id didn't work that way in the Cambridge  Analytica case, right.  And that's where it got brought up a little bit  yesterday and that's why -- I think that's sort of at the heart of this  matter is what are we as users of Facebook -- there's so much focus  yesterday on how they use their data for advertising.  That's their  business model -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCSHANE:  -- but what are we as users of Facebook have a right to know.  So  if there's a breach of my data, somebody gets my credit card information,  that day the bank's telling me, hey they got your credit card, you need to  get a new card.</p><p> Whereas in the Cambridge Analytica case, they took forever to call.  They  didn't tell anybody.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out something real quick.  This is beyond - - to understand what Facebook was doing -- from 2007 until 2015, it's not  about Cambridge Analytica.  It's about your information being accessed by a  friends' app -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And no one knew -- no one knew that any app developer was  accessing your information.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Fully agreed -- fully agreed and you know, we are talking  about a private entity here that has agreements with the Federal Trade  Commission to inform Connell if for example there was a breach of your  account and the failure to do that result in a fine, sounds small, but do  the math of $40,000 per breach.   </p><p> JAIN:  You had 87 million breaches -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  Do the math, 710 that is a huge number even for  Zuckerberg.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And by the way, that consent decree was put in place two years  before they actually ended the practice of letting all the app developers  access the information from not only the app users but the friends of the  app users.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  All right.  Can I talk to you about delicious irony?  These  senators ranting and raving about Facebook violating privacy, what is the  greatest violator of personal privacy on the planet?  The federal  government.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTIGATION STRATEGIST, CFRA:  The government.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government that they run and that they fund and that they  authorize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sorry.</p><p> JAIN:  No, we were just -- we were just saying that.  I mean the amount of  data -- what data does the federal government not have access to anyway  they are looking for from Facebook for this particular case.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that there is an answer to that question.  They  can get everything.</p><p> JAIN:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They know everywhere I go when this is with me, every  conversation I had, even when you and I talk in the greenroom, every e-mail  that I send and every text that I send.  It's not just me.  It's all of us.</p><p> JAIN:  Everyone is worried about Facebook listening to your microphone but  the Feds actually have the ability to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  The judge is worked up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge, not that that helps.</p><p> But the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke about  Mueller's investigation yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein oversees the special counsel and only  he has the power to fire the special counsel.  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, we've been  advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  these comments of course, after the FBI raided the office, the  home and the hotel room of longtime personal attorney to President Trump,  Michael Cohen.  That raid has raising questions about attorney-client  privilege.  What about firing Mueller in that as well?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Ok.  Let's start with firing Mueller.  There are areas of the  law that are very clear.  Go 30 miles an hour in front of the Fox Building,  you get a ticket because the speed limit is 25.  There's really no dispute.   The cops have discretion if you're doing 25 and 30.</p><p> Can the President of the United States fire a special counsel?  The law is  unclear.  There is a federal regulation that governs the Justice Department  that says specifically only the appointing authority, in this case Rod  Rosenstein, can fire the special counsel and it has got to be for cause.</p><p> There is other authority that says the President runs the executive branch  of the government and he can fire whoever he wants for any sound reason, a  person in the executive branch that's not protected by civil service.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President could rescind that law that gives Rosenstein the  authority to fire him, could he?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No.  Only Congress can.  It is in the CFR.  It's easy for  Congress to do that, the Code of Federal Regulations but it would require  Congress to do that.  That law comes about -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JAIN:  -- the investigation. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has never been tested before.  But when Richard Nixon had  Professor Archibald Cox fired, he directed his attorney general to do it,  the attorney general resigned.  He directed the number two person at DOJ to  do it.  That person resigned.  He directed the number three person to do  it, Bob Bork of notoriety later on in life.  He fired the special counsel  and was replaced by another special counsel as we know undid the President.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we should also point out that it was revealed last week the  Mueller probe, they don't view President Trump as a criminal target.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They view him as a subject.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A subject but not -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You could go from subject to target -- </p><p> MCSHANE:  It could change.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- like that.  </p><p> Now here is what is interesting -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- if I could between the lines, in the weeds, whatever phrase  you want to use about what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday.  They did  research.  They dispatched lawyers to give them a legal opinion, the White  House as to whether or not the President of the United States on his own  bypassing the AG, bypassing the deputy attorney general could single- handedly fire Bob Mueller and their research told them yes.</p><p> Why did they do that research?  It remains to be seen.  </p><p> BELL:  Wouldn't he rather prefer to fire Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Rod Rosenstein.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Would that look better.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and was confirmed by the Senate.</p><p> He can fire Rod Rosenstein just like he could fire any cabinet officer.   Politically it would be damaging but legally he could do it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You better show me how to do it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to make you laugh before you went. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure -- guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Such a pleasure, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> Fox Business Network will bring you Zuckerberg's testimony live at 10:00  a.m.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news -- a plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  We're just getting some new  numbers then -- Dagen.  Good morning.</p><p> An Algerian military jet has crashed near the country's capital killing at  least 257 people.  The plane came down near a military base shortly after  it took off.  Authorities there say some survivors have been rescued.  It  is not clear what caused this crash but it's the worst plane crash in  Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet went down killing 102 people.</p><p> Well, let's head back home to south Florida, that state hit by two  tornadoes.  The National Weather Service says the first one struck downtown  Fort Lauderdale yesterday afternoon packing winds of up to 65 miles an hour  -- look at that.  The twister knocked out power, thousands delayed hundreds  of flights out of the airport there.</p><p> The second tornado touched down near Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Airport  about an hour later with winds topping out at 84 miles an hour.  One of the  runways was closed for more than two hours while crews picked up all of the  debris.  Look at those crushed metal.</p><p> Well, Chevrolet is stepping up its challenge to Ford, showing off its next- generation Silverado and it is enormous.  2020 Silverado HD is going to  built in Flint, Michigan.  It's going to roll off the production line in  the third quarter of 2019.  Ford has dominated the pickup truck segment and  Chevy is hoping hopes to close the gap with three new Silverado's.  Shares  of General Motors are down 7 percent so far this year.</p><p> Ok.  Chick-Fil-A has won top-rankings of food quality and customer service.   Now, it looks like they've won over teenagers.  And a survey of teens from  Piper Jaffray, Chick-Fil-A beat out chains including, get this, Starbucks,  Chipotle, even McDonald's.  Chick-Fil-A has an established following in the  south.  Now, the chain is gaining fans in places like New York City because  it's right down that street, and the Midwest.  In 2017 Chick-Fil-A reported  one of the $9 billion in revenue up more than a billion from 2016.  And by  2020 Chick-Fil-A is expected by some analysts to be the third largest  restaurant chain in the United States by sales anyway -- Dagen.</p><p> And true story, when I was in high school I worked at Chick-Fil-A.  Yes, at  the mall in Phoenix, Arizona and then they found out that I was lying about  my age and they fired me.  But it was a fun couple of weeks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  By the way, people love Chick-Fil-A because the people who  operate the franchises and the people who work there are nice. </p><p> CASONE:  They're nice.  Yes.  The food is good.  Chicken is good.  Like I  said, down the street.  I know you won't go there but I might -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a giant one down at the Fulton Street Market -- </p><p> CASONE:  New York.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- the biggest in the country, by the way.  </p><p> CASONE:  New Yorkers love it, man.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, New Yorkers do like nice people.  </p><p> Coming up easing tensions over tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping  sparking a rally yesterday with comments on the opening up about the  economy.  We'll look at the chances that we avoid trade war.</p><p> And a whole new meaning to watching the scales -- why doctors are warning  the snake diet is going viral.  You don't eat snakes -- we will explain  straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The art of trade war -- U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers going head to head.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" U.S.  trade official are laying blame on Chinese metal firms for rerouting goods  to other countries like Vietnam in order to skirt tariffs.  This coming  after Chinese President Xi Jinping said that he would open markets and ease  some import tariffs yesterday.</p><p> Futures are looking like this, this morning.  We ought to point out that  the futures took a turn even lower with a 268-point loss on the Dow futures  right now right after President Trump sent out that tweet on Syria about  Russia.</p><p> So I want to point out that that is why you are seeing the selling pick up  steam as we move a little bit more than two hours away from the opening  bell.</p><p> Joining me now is Payden &amp; Rygel chief economist Jeffrey Cleveland -- what  to make of the trade issue.  That seems to have been rocking markets  lately.  But this all started -- the volatility came back with a vengeance  in early February because of concerns about inflation and higher interests  rates.  So what is it?  </p><p> JEFFREY CLEVELAND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PAYDEN AND RYGEL:  Well, I think the  trade story is like so many narratives in the market, you know, people get  really attached to them it becomes -- it dominates headlines and then it  goes away because we make too much of it.</p><p> That is how I remember last year and the Fed's balance sheet story,  remember how the Fed was going to shrink its balance sheet and that it was  going to be a big deal.  That didn't happen.</p><p> Before that, you know, you had things like the fiscal cliff.  So I think  that is what, for me, the trade story is.  It doesn't change our overall  growth outlook.  </p><p> BELL:  But is that true though because you are immediately seeing impact to  steel prices, pork prices, soybean prices. So that is impacting the farmers  in the Midwest. But then when does it creep into sentiment numbers for the  consumer for businesses.  I know small business sentiment was at a new high  in the most recent reading.  So I feel like once it creeps into those  numbers you could really start to see an economic impact.  </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I think you're exactly right.  If you look at -- you do  have market moves.  You have volatility.  The question is does that feed  into the actual economic data.  The earliest read of that I think would be  a small business survey which has come off a little from the highs but it's  still very elevated.</p><p> So I don't think the market volatility has bled through into the economic  outlook.  And I think the story really is going back to the inflation  story.  I mean we had that shock early February with the jobs report, the  average hourly earnings number.  I think that's set off a re-pricing in the  bond market which bled through into equities.</p><p> So it's really for me the inflation story that's driving everything here,  and I think today -- </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  We get the CPI today.  The core is expected to be 2.1 percent  by Bloomberg's latest survey.  That's the first time, it is ever 2 percent  in a handful of months at least.  I'm not exactly sure what's your take on  that if we get that more than 2 percent number.  </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I mean I don't want to make too much of it.  This is not  the 1970s.  This is stagflation or anything like that.  I do think 2.1  percent -- that 2 percent is a real critical threshold for the bond market  because the 2 percent is the number that the Fed is targeting.  So if, you  know, the bond market has been complacent for months because inflation was  low, it was sub 2 percent, you suddenly get above 2 percent, just  psychologically, I think that changes the game.</p><p> And then people start looking around.  You know, how it works, looking  around they start seeing inflation everywhere.  So they're going to start  seeing it in the aluminum prices, in oil prices.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, they're going to see it at the pump this summer.</p><p> CLEVELAND:  Exactly -- gasoline prices.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that changes sentiment because again, that's one inflation  gauge that people relate to from East Coast to West Coast.  </p><p> BELL:  It's the consumers wall -- Jamie Dimon has been really warning about  the potential for higher inflation going forward too, to this.  Maybe it  could be just the beginning.</p><p> We are getting into earnings season and a lot of the bulls are hanging  their hat on earnings really being what is going to calm this market.  Do  you believe that we'll get a look at the fundamentals?</p><p> CLEVELAND:  You know, I think near-term I do worry that the inflation story  will surprise the market.  We will get another repricing in interest rates  that will have a knock-on effect on the equity market.  So there's a short  term.  So that's -- I think over the next three months, let's say.</p><p> Longer-term, what I'm worried about is -- and what I'm going to focus on is  do we continue to see the unemployment rate fall?  If the unemployment rate  falls below 4 percent I think that is good for the consumer, I think that's  good for earnings.  </p><p> So it's really that story that I think over the, you know, the six to 12  month timeframe that will be more important.  And I think that will happen.   I think the unemployment rate falls below 4 percent in the next few months.   And that's fantastic.</p><p> We have only been that low on the unemployment rate three times in the  post-war era -- late 60s, late 90s for a few months, and the late 50s.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jeffrey -- good to see you.  Jeffrey Cleveland -- </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Nice to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Payden and Rygel.  Take care -- </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- and we will be watching again.  CPI out about a little more  than an hour from now.</p><p> Still ahead the immigration debate heating up -- why another California  town is joining the fight against sanctuary cities.</p><p> And the sky is the limit for the new airbus planes -- the wild features in  store for flyers, beds in the cargo hold.  Oh and playground slides.</p><p> That's ahead</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure amid rising tensions with Syria.  President Trump warning  earlier this hour that missiles will be coming.  And you are seeing those  concerns show up in the stock market in the Futures.  We have a 257 point  loss on the Dow Futures.  That's -- they were down already about 175, 180  before Trump said that about Russia and Bashar al-Assad but again you see  the nervousness front center in the Futures.  The investors are also  waiting on inflation data, consumer prices, and the minutes from the  Federal Reserve latest meeting, You'll going to get that this afternoon.

But the  actor who is set to star as the late politician, I promise you it will  surprise you.  </p><p> Our top story this half hour, escalating tensions between the United States  and Russia.  The Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike against the Assad regime.  But now Futures are extending  losses after President Trump's tweet earlier.  Here's what the President  said on Twitter.  'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia because they will be coming.  Nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.'  This coming after Moscow voted against a U.N.  resolution yesterday to investigate Saturday's suspected chemical attack  that killed dozens of people in Syria.  Joining me now is the member of the  House Committees on Judiciary and Foreign Affairs, Texas Congressman Ted  Poe.  Congressman Poe, your reactions to very strong words from the  President.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  Well, the President wants the Russians and really  the Syrians to know now where we stand on this issue.  Chemical weapons,  the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law.  The  Russians and the Syrians agreed a year or two ago to get rid of all of the  chemical weapons out of Syria.  They lied.  They're still there and they're  being used against the people of Syria.  There has to be consequences for  this violation of international law and the President is going to have a --  I suspect a targeted strike into Syria in retaliation for the use of  chemical weapons.  There are many options that's are available down the  road, most of them are not very good and the fact that I don't think most  Americans want a full military invasion of Syria.  I don't think that's  going to happen.  Targeted strike to get their attention is something that  I think the President's going to do and I support him in that.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK.  So, to your point, if the tweet is a directive, we are going  down the road of military action against Syria, there's almost no doubt  about it after the President's comments, Congressman this morning.  So  targeted strike to get their attention, once you have it, then what?   What's the goal?  </p><p> POE:  Well, the goal is to immediately have them quit using chemical  weapons.  Now, that has not worked in the past.  They went ahead and used  chemical weapons anyway.  So, there has to be some retaliation to the  Syrians and to the Russians and don't forget the Iranians.  The Iranians  are involved in all of this too, who've murdered their own people.  And  what that will be, I hope is something that will cease and desist on the  use of chemical weapons in the Civil War in Syria.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, how big is the --</p><p> POE:  The United States is not going -- the United States is not going to  topple the regime, remove Assad.  That's not going to happen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Despite the air -- the strike on that air base, that airfield  last year, there's a lot that the United States has not done to really go  after Bashar al-Assad.  I'll point to a chlorine gas attack earlier this  year, killed more than 20 people, mostly children and that warranted what  was essentially a statement from Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state,  that was saying that it was no denying that Russia by shielding its Syrian  ally has breached its commitment to the United States as a framework  guarantor, this is about the U.N. deal some years ago brokered by the Obama  administration.  </p><p> But again, we didn't strike.  And Bashar al-Assad read that as quite  frankly, weakness and that he would pay no price.  We've also did not stop  Iran from establishing a new military presence on the border with Israel in  Syria.  So, how big does this message need to be?  Do we need to take out  the entire air force of Bashar al-Assad?  </p><p> POE:  What we do really, I think is something that the military and the  President need to decide.  But it has to be strong enough to keep the  Russians, the Iranians and the Syrians from using chemical weapons on their  own people.  And that it has to be the message that we send to them.  Assad  is I think going to stay in power.  It's not our plan to remove him.  I do  not see the United States using a full military invasion of Syria, but I  think a strike will be strong enough to say look, you have to cease and  desist.  The Russians and the Iranians and the Syrians, they cannot be  trusted.  They are using this as a proxy war to really influence, have  their own Russian and Iranian influence in Syria with Assad as their  puppet.  But that needs to be strong.  And I think it will be strong when  the President decides what exactly to do in military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now, do they heat the sanctuary show down, another  California City voting overnight to join the Justice Department law suit.   Challenging the so-called sanctuary state law.  Watch as residents in  Orange County take a bold stance against the policy limiting cooperation  between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT:  Anybody for (INAUDIBLE) doesn't realize we're  talking about criminals here, not refugees, not immigrants, criminals.   We're going to deport them and that's just too bad if you don't like it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Members of the National Guard in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas  have already begun arriving at the southern border.  The California has not  yet complied with President Trump's request.  Congressman, your thoughts on  this? </p><p> POE:  It's a smart move on the part of the President to put the National  Guard on the border.  I'm from Texas.  And we had the National Guard down  there a few years ago.  And it worked.  It stopped people from crossing  into the United States.  So, I totally support that idea because it's  something that has worked in the past.  Now, one thing that we need to do  as a nation is remember, we have to protect the border and the border is  the middle of the Rio Grande River.  </p><p> And once people cross that middle and come into the United States, they're  already in the United States.  So, our philosophy needs to be keep people  from crossing.  Therefore, we need boats in the water, down the middle of  the Rio Grande River and we also need the aerostats, cameras and those kind  of things to prevent people from crossing in the first place.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  We are showing a graphic that says border  apprehensions in March did surge, up more than 200 percent year over year  but they had been dramatically falling since the year 2000, in fact.  I  believe last year they were at the lowest level since 1971.  So, the action  by this administration is in response to those apprehensions going up in  recent months.  I want to get your reaction, Congressman, President Trump  is quite busy this morning, just tweeting this about Russia.  \"Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been.  And that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together.  Stop the arms race.\"  </p><p> Congressman, your reaction to that?  Because again, this President more  than any other has been attacked by people on the left, people in the media  for being light on Russia, again pushing that narrative of collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia and his actions and words have both  been incredibly strong at laying down what he feels about Russia, Russia  interference and Russian aggression.  </p><p> POE:  Well, there are people in the media who are obsessed with hating on  Trump and they will use anything they can to do so.  And Russia is one of  the examples.  Look at the big picture.  The President has been tough on  Russia and he's going to continue to be tough on Russia because Russia is a  bully.  They lie about their foreign policy.  They have invaded crime  media, they have invaded Eastern Ukraine, they have invaded Georgia with no  consequences.  And they're going to continue.  </p><p> I think Putin is going to continue when he finds an opportunity to move  into somebody else's country and try to put troops there.  The President of  the United States recognizes that, and we need to -- and he sees the  importance of making sure that Russia is not an aggressor nation like it  wants to be.  In his talk is tough and also his actions are tough of  removing spies from the United States, sending them back home where they  belong.  And I think it is a new day in the relationship with Russia is  that we need to get tough on Russia.  But Russia needs to work with the  west and they refuse to do so.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I think, one thing that did not get enough attention were  the sanctions on Putin's rich cronies and their ability to do business  sanctions on their assets, lending their ability to do business.  That hits  somewhere it hurts and ultimately that might change Putin's behavior.  But  again, not much coverage of what the Treasury Department did last week.   Congressman, it's good to see you.  Congressman Poe from Texas.  Take care.  </p><p> POE:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a cheap repair could cost you in the long run.  Why  iPhone owners may want to think twice before using a third party to fix a  broken screen.  And Hollywood taking Toronto, the unexpected choice set to  play controversial ex-mayor Rob Ford in an upcoming movie.  He looks more  like Connell McShane.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  What?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a hint.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets under pressure this morning amid rising tensions with  Russia and Syria.  The President Trump has been tweeting this hour about  this relationship and about Syria and here's what he had to say.  'Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together to stop the arms race.'  Earlier this  hour he said 'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  </p><p> Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming.  Nice and new and, \"smart\".   You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.'  What has been the reaction in the markets?  Futures  are lower, 230-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, but loss is kind of  equal losses on all three major market gauges in the Futures market so far  this morning.  And that selling is picking up steam because of those  tweets.  Meantime, Apple loses a major patent infringement case.  Cheryl  Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes Dagen, another stock to watch today as  well.  Shares of VirnetX surging since the Federal Jury in Texas said that  Apple must pay that security software company $500 million over infringed  patents.  And the Jury ruled that Apple's FaceTime, its VPN and its Demand  on iMessage features infringe four of VirnetX patents.  The imagers based  on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices.  This is a big one.   Meanwhile, there is more iPhone problems to tell you about.  A new update  disables iPhone eight devices that have screens that were at some point  repaired by a third party.  The update renders the touch screen useless.   The only option, you have to replace the screen again and Apple has to do  it.  A similar problem happened with the iPhone seven.  That was fixed,  though.  Anyway, another stock to watch going to be Apple today.  It's  slightly lower in the premarket.  </p><p> OK, here's something for you.  Especially if you fly a lot, Airbus may have  come up with the next big thing in travel on long range flights.  Bunk beds  in the cargo hold.  You're looking at the rendering of this idea.  They  plan to include this on the A330 and A350 jets by 2020.  Airbus is also  looking at offering a children's play area, complete with a playground, a  slide, and even hospital rooms on-board.  Passengers (INAUDIBLE) passengers  would have to be buckled in and seated during take-off and landing.  Shares  of Airbus are up more than 15 percent.  I said this on \"FBN:AM\" this  morning Dagen (INAUDIBLE) the story that basically, I don't know, they'll  put the play room and the beds side-by-side.  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Don't play in the streets.  Play in a \"sleeping berth\" which  they haven't cleaned for the last 80 flights (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> CASONE:  I'm hoping they clean them.  I'm hoping they clean them.  OK  really quick one more.  Billion-star Damian Lewis reportedly set to play  Toronto's controversial former mayor Rob Ford in a new movie.  Hollywood  reporter is saying that the 47-year-old British actor has been cast to play  the mayor.  The movie is going to be called \"Run This Town\".  Remember Ford  died from cancer back in 2016.  But he made international headlines 2013  when a cell phone video showed him smoking crack cocaine.  Dagen, here's  the thing, Damian Lewis is a really small guy, I mean, he's a slight guy,  he's a good-looking guy but he's a thin man.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We call him \"Billions\", he was on \"Homeland\".  I was trying to  say that the guy cast to play Rob Ford looks more like Connell than Rob  Ford.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, I was wondering about that.  I was wondering who's it going  to be actually.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the tease.</p><p> MCSHANE: (INAUDIBLE) it could be a lot worse speaking Dagen's past  pronounced. With it could be a lot worse. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, and I -- He's a fine actor.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  He is a good actor.  He's a very good actor.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can he play Rob Ford?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I don't know if anyone can play Rob Ford.  We miss -- we miss old  Rob Ford.  He was -- he was an original.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know who could play Rob Ford?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Who?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris Farley.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, it's not going to happen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, may he rest in peace.</p><p> MCSHANE:  It's not going to happen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have to get you to watch \"Billions\".</p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I love \"Billions\".  I got to get you to watch  \"Billions\".</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I do, it's on my list.</p><p> JAIN:  Catch up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On Showtime.  We'll be right back, everybody.  Coming up next,  shedding your winter skin, the health issues behind the viral new trend  dubbed Snake Diet.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Favorite story of the day.  Can eating like a snake help you  lose weight?  There is a new fad diet called the Snake Diet.  Participants  drink nothing but apple cider vinegar with mineral replacements for two  days and then go on a flexible fasting routine.  The diet founder claims  say it is similar to how snakes eat.  The critics of the diet claim it is  dangerous and will not produce long-term results.  Joining me now is Doctor  Mikhail Varshavski.  Better known as Doctor Mike.  Tell us what you think  about this.  </p><p> MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, FAMILY MEDICINE:  I will say this, at the  outset right away, this is not a healthy diet.  This is not going to give  you any kind of results.  It's probably going to be dangerous for your  health and the person who created this diet, his name is Cole Robinson,  actually has a video on Youtube where he talks about it.  It's borderline  psychopath behavior.  He's calling people fatties.  He's screaming about  how you're supposed to eat like a snake and it's in our nature.  He makes  wild claims that it's going to cure type two diabetes, inflammation,  herpes.  </p><p> None of this is substantiated by science.  And I'm so passionate about  this, I just gave it, had talked about six months ago on this type of  experts.  They're IKA experts, I know all.  They think they understand  everything there is to know about science research and doctors don't know  what they're doing.  When in reality what they do is they take fringe  scientific research, weak scientific research, combine it and pull it  together and think that they've created the next new magical fact.  And  this is an example of it, the Snake Diet which is just complete, complete  garbage.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I call it, you know, it's not attention seeking behavior, I call  them attention seeking dolts, ASD.  But by the way, let me just clear  something up.  Because I, I'm a reptile freak.  A snake, like a six-foot  diamond carpet python eats once every two weeks, it drinks water and it  will eat one medium size rat.  It should be dead and frozen and then  thawed.  Otherwise the rat might bite the snake.  But it eats one rat every  two weeks. </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK, that's not a diet for anybody but --  </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Look, this gentleman basically claims that prolonged fasting  will help you lose weight.  Yes, eating less will help you lose weight.   But you don't need to do it so drastically.  Because number one, you won't  stick with such a crazy, strict diet.  People who have comorbidities or  other illnesses like diabetes or heart failure if they follow his dry  fasting or salt water fasting routine.  They'll overload the fluid --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here's the problem, no, here's the problem, if you starve me and  tell me to fast, I'm not going to act like a snake.  I will turn into a  fire-breathing dragon.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's kind of weird.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And what, I'm sitting -- I get really irritable.  Hungry.   Hungry.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You got to hold and knock this guy?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Tell me one snake you know that has herpes.  I have to be honest  with you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  I can't argue that.  I can't argue that as a doctor.  I don't  know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what?  Snakes do get mites.  They're specific to  snakes, snake mite.  And they're very hard to get rid of.  Dr. Mike, love  you.  It's always great to see you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you so much, appreciate it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like it when you get upset because you're cool about it.   Ankur Jain you have to come back.  Good to see you my friend.</p><p> JAIN:  Great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman Cain is up next hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p> You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.  Shares seeing their biggest gain in  two years as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced that grilling on ca Capitol Hill  over everything from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal to possible  Russian election interference. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  When you add more rules that companies  need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently  just has the resources to go do and that might just be harder for a smaller  company getting started to be able to comply with.  There are real  challenges that we face around content and privacy.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If we're counting on Facebook to  regulate itself, we're going to fail.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he'll  testify before house lawmakers.  He kept his cool yesterday and didn't make  the face when asked stupid questions by those Senators that everybody at  home watching did.  Fox Business will bring you that live coverage starting  at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  Tragedy in Algeria, the details after a military  plane crashes, killing at least 250 people.

Now the  company is looking to keep up that success.  The big plans for your  listening habits ahead.  And talk about a royal snub, both President Trump  and former President Barack Obama will not be invite ted to the upcoming  royal wedding.  Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and  the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list.  Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p> HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p> CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p> CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p> BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p> BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p> REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p> I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p> There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p> The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p> That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p> CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p> Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p> Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p> And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p> CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p> BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p> CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p> CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p> CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p> CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p> CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p> CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p> CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p> The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p> CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p> CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p> And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p> Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p> And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p> REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p> SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p> NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p> DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p> CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p> MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p> MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p> CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p> So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p> So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p> And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p> I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p> VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p> CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p> MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p> CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p> CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p> CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not in the least.  But he got a big job done,  the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the  board of?  No, I don't think so.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's all over my head.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Sorry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office?  We'll be right  back, everybody.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks all, Herman Cain.  Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p> VARNEY:  I shall.  Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.  The  President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  April 11th.  Your top stories at 6a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks surging, the Dow climbing more than 400 points yesterday after  China's President Xi Jinping promised an open market and to cut tariffs on  auto imports.  Futures are showing this, 400 plus point gain on the Dow  Futures on the Dow yesterday.  Ninety point loss on the Dow Futures today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, stocks there mostly lower.  Across the board losses in England,  France, and Germany, although slight.  And it was mixed reaction in Asia  overnight with gains in Shanghai and on the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the top winners yesterday, Facebook shares seeing their biggest gain  in two years, up about four and a half percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg did  an admirable job facing a grilling on Capitol Hill from people who clearly  didn't understand Facebook, some of them.  He was grilled on everything,  from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian election interference, you  name it, he was asked it, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens  here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What Mark Zuckerberg's testimony could mean for future  regulation in the tech sector, that's ahead.  He's back on Capitol Hill at  10:00a.m. this morning.  </p><p>Nunes fighting back, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee set  to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director  Christopher Wray as the Justice Department still refuses to provide him  with an unredacted document showing the justification for their Russia  probe.  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol, that's ahead.</p><p>Bank of America changing its stance on firearms.  The bank says it will no  longer lend money to companies that make so-called assault rifles for  civilians.  </p><p>Plus, never give up on your dreams, after spending 10 years in the  development league, on basketball player delivers a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  The incredible story coming up.</p><p>And one small step for man, one giant leap online, NASA helping you channel  your inner Neil Armstrong with a brand new virtual tour of the moon.</p><p>All of that coming up and so much more this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  FOX Business's Connell McShane.  And Kairos  Founder, Ankur Jain.  Ankur, just really quickly, what was your take on  Zuckerberg yesterday?</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I'm going to tell you, Mark did a great job.   I mean, all things considered.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love how you refer to him by his first name.</p><p>JAIN:  But I mean look, I got to tell you, the good thing was I think that  Zuckerberg did a great job for Facebook.  I think the challenge that the  congressmen had no idea what to ask to actually address the problem, and  that's a challenge.  This is an important topic.  And if you're going to  have the Senate sitting there taking the time to figure out what  regulations technology need, they need to know the right questions asked.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, right.  We have another episode of old  people talking technology at 10:00 this morning, right?  They had no idea  how to follow-up was the main point.  </p><p>JAIN:  I mean, honestly some of other was just a lack of understanding what  Facebook is.  Somebody -- I forget which one of the congressman held up a  poster board of five Facebook groups and goes, \"Mr. Zuckerberg, are you --  can you authenticate that these were not owned by Russian trolls?\"</p><p>If I were him, I would have been like, \"There are three billion groups.  I  don't remember every single group.\"  I mean, it's just --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  It's just a shame.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was prepped.  He bought the kind of legal prep that billions  of dollars can buy, put it that way.  And he followed the script that was  handed to him, we'll get into that.  That's what we're talking about, the  top of the show.  </p><p>And coming up this morning, Texas Congressman, House Financial Services  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Texas Congressman Ted Poe.  Former  Presidential Candidate Herman Cain.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  And Dr. Mike, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski on the snake diet,  yes, that's one of our things that we'll be discussing with Dr. Mike.</p><p>But to our top story this hour, Mark Zuckerberg squaring off with lawmakers  on Capitol Hill, the Facebook CEO testifying for about five hours before  skeptical senators who demanded answers on how the social media company  allowed Cambridge Analytica to misuse the personal data up to 87 million  Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DUBIN (D), ILLINIOS, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel  you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p>DUBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DUBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, (INAUDIBLE) in modern  America, \"connecting people around the world.\"</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:   Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today and I say this  gently, your user agreement sucks.  You can spot me 75 IQ points, if I can  figure that, you can figure that.  The purpose of that user agreement is to  cover Facebook's rear-end, it's not to inform your users about their  rights. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors did react positively to Zuckerberg's performance.   Shares of the social media company were up four and a half percent.  Mark  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning.  He is set to testify  before House lawmakers.</p><p>Joining us now, Gabelli Multimedia Trust Portfolio Manager, Larry Haverty.   Larry, my takeaway if -- looking at it from a market perspective and in an  investor perspective is, even without additional regulations which might be  coming, Facebook's going to be spending a lot more money on security, on  policing the content on that social media platform.  Is that fully factored  into the stock, their increase in expenses?</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST:  Well I think  that's the $64,000 question here.  There are two context that I think this  discussion needs to be framed in.  </p><p>The first is the emotional context and that was the theater that the  Congressional grilling provided for viewers yesterday.  Five hours is an  awfully long time and I think Mark did very, very well on that.  I'd give  him an A- grade.  I thought the best answer was the hotel one and I think - - I thought he gave the wrong answer when I heard it but then I thought  maybe it was the right answer because he does need to maintain his personal  security and frankly, it isn't anyone's real business where he stays.</p><p>The second question remains answer -- unanswered though and that's the  financial question.  And you look at what Facebook's doing, they've said  they're going to add 5,000 people, that's a good crowd for a small college  basketball game.  Those people are going to need facilities, I think that's  at least a $1 billion cost, that raises the cost based on Facebook by a  very significant amount.</p><p>Now, this is a company with very, very strong margins.  My guess is that  the margins are going to go down at least 500 points but I think we have to  wait two weeks to more or less figure this out when Facebook reports its  first quarter and I'm pretty sure if the people gave Zuckerberg the advice  they did and he performed as well as he did, the crisis managers are going  to tell them how to handle the earnings release which I think is to be  upfront with the cost on this as much as possible and I think that's not a  hundred percent, they're not going to know until probably a year later how  much they spent.</p><p>They'll clearly be a significant one-time charge but with $41 billion,  that's not a big deal.  Net-net, the stock had been in my opinion, if  nothing went wrong and clearly that's no longer the case.  The stock had  been priced very cheaply relative to its growth and I think it can handle  this once the computers that are trained especially in technology  investments to detest the margin contraction get few -- get through with  selling the stock the minute the numbers come out because I think there  will be margin pressure greater than people expect and I think once the  numbers come out, the first trade will be down on the stock in a couple  weeks.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, what was your take yesterday on what happened?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Well I think the stock  was up because this could have been just a relief rally or maybe it was a  short selling -- a short squeeze, excuse me.</p><p>Larry, I'd love to get your take though, when I think about Facebook, I  wonder about the future of this company because you have Mark Zuckerberg  out there talking to the press saying and -- to senators saying that,  \"Look, we are kind of like a media company, you are seeing expense going  up, you're going to see margin compression.\"  Trading at 22 times, yes,  that's a huge discount to its historical average but it's still premium to  media companies.  Where is this company going to evolve to?  You've got  Sheryl and Mark talking about paid subscription services, what is the  future of Facebook and what's the right valuation to value that?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, I think the secret sauce here is very important and that's  the first thing I learned about this company and mercifully I learned it  before it went public from talking with some people who did business with  the company.  </p><p>The advertising works and it's very unique.  You have David Ogilvy, one of  the advertising gurus historically 50 percent of advertising works, I just  don't know which 50 percent.  Facebook can prove its efficacy, it's more  efficient than alternatives.  So advertisers, unless there are real, real  major problems are going to embrace it.  They're not going to walk away.  A  few may walk away, my guess is maybe you lose two to three percent on add  volume, you're clearly going to have cautious CPM pricing for the next 12  months and then I think the systems will write themselves but this company  has a tremendous comparative advantage versus comp.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  CPM being called for million (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Tremendous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cost for thousand views (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes, cost for thousand.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your take on what you heard about regulation from  these senators yesterday because it's not going to be just Facebook.  As an  entrepreneur, are you worried about Washington getting in the way of  innovation and creation?</p><p>JAIN:  So I think -- look, let's break it out.  One, Zuck said himself that  Facebook is open to the right kind of regulation.  I think secondly, it's  really not the Facebook problem, right?  I mean, Google has as much or more  data on users than Facebook does.</p><p>The question is, what's the right kind of regulation?  After watching the  Congress yesterday ask their questions, I worry that if they're left to  create regulation it will do things that stifle innovation and actually  block the services that actual people --</p><p>MCSHANE:  We never got to that question about what the -- I mean, maybe we  did.  I mean, to the entire -- to whatever else, five or six hours but what  I saw, it never got to your question which is what is the right type of  regulation.  </p><p>I think Kamala Harris, the senator from California maybe came closest and  she tried to press him, I think it was in the 6:00 hour Eastern Time  talking about Cambridge Analytica data breach.  It's like, why didn't you  tell the users about that?  He's like, \"We know that they are taking our  data, we know they're using it for advertising to make it more targeted.\"   But once there's a breach, why weren't the users told about that and what  type of regulation can help prevent that in the future?  And he dodged.</p><p>JAIN:  I think the common theme you saw throughout Zuck's testimony was  transparency.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  And I think that is ultimately where the right regulation goes, is  that as long as these companies are transparent about what they're doing  with data, what's happening with the data, I think at that point, the  user's decisions on how much they want to give Facebook, how much they want  to use Facebook, et cetera.  And so, hopefully the Congress will lean  towards that kind of regulation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will end on this note, one, Sheryl Sandberg needs the same  kind of grilling from the legal team that Mark Zuckerberg does because,  again, her kind of like flip hair-toss reaction to what's been going on at  Facebook for the last decade is a little dismissive to investors and two,  what was ironic was listening to those senators asks Mark Zuckerberg those  questions was the equivalent of watching my 82-year-old father try to use  Facebook.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That he was like -- it was the equivalent of like flicking the  phone like there's a bug on it and then dimming the screen to the point  that he throws the phone at you and tells you he -- that Facebook broke his  phone, that's what it felt like.</p><p>JAIN:  If Facebook does have access to people's car records, I'd love for  them to release how many Congressmen called their grandkids that morning  and say, \"Can you please quickly walk me through Facebook before I  interview this Mark guy.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  It's embarrassing.  A bunch of times it's embarrassing.  It  was -- I mean, it's almost like when we do an interview with someone, you - - a lot of times you know the subject, you're ready to follow-up like this.   But if you're not -- if you don't know the topic, you can ask the first  question, forget about the follow-ups and that was -- what happened a ton  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But fear the wiley southerner because I think Lindsey Graham  acted all folksy and very foghorn leghorn but then he backed Mark into  trying to basically asking him if you have a monopoly.  And so I thought  that he used -- he was like, \"Go ahead, assume that I'm stupid because I'm  from the south\" and then he went in for the kill shot.</p><p>JAIN:  It was definitely smart at some point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you Ankur.  Larry, it was great to have you here,  terrific analysis as always, please come back very, very soon Larry  Haverty.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And keep it here on FOX Business for live coverage of Mark  Zuckerberg's testimony before House lawmakers today, starts at 10:00a.m.  Eastern Time.  </p><p>Meantime, Bank of America's big move against guns, the bank won't lend to  companies that make so-called assault weapons for civilian use.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>And time is up, House Intel share Devin Nunes is done waiting for the FBI  and DOJ to hand over Russia probe documents.  And now he says it's time for  someone at the top to face serious consequences.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sprint and T-Mobile talking about a merger again.  Cheryl Casone  has the detail, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, really Dagen.  The third fourth largest  U.S. wireless carriers are back in the negotiating table again.  The merger  would lump together 127 million customers and get some serious competition  to Verizon and AT&amp;T, that nation's top two providers.</p><p>T-mobile and Sprint were in talks before but those ended because the  (INAUDIBLE) valuation disagreements between the two companies.  Since then,  Sprint stock has taken a dive, it lost about a fifth of its value.  The  company has long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Shares of T-mobile  are also down nearly six percent year-to-date.  So, we shall see.</p><p>Theranos is making some major job cuts, report say the blood testing firm  laying off almost everybody that works there in an effort to keep the  company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoffs chopped the company's  workforce from 125 to about two dozen employees, that is way down from  2015, they had 800 people there at the time.  Founder and CEO Elizabeth  Homes has announced the staffing changes nearly a month after settling  civil fraud charges with the SEC which forced her to give a voting control  over her own company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, WalletHub has released its annual list of best places to live for  millennials.  Here are the top three states, Minnesota ranked high on the  list coming in at number three.  North Dakota coming in at number two,  these are very cool places.  And then get this, the top spot not  technically a state but it's the nation's capital.  According to the study,  Washington, D.C. the best place for millennials to live.</p><p>Millennials make up 35 percent of D.C.'s workforce, key indicators of  living standards like average monthly earnings for millennials and, of  course, the unemployment rate for them were looked at.  D.C. millennials  say that the abundance of people their age is also a big attraction for  moving there.  So, staying with the younger generation, looks like young  adults, the share of them that are living with their parents is right now  at the highest in 75 years.  This is depressing parents.  </p><p>A few research center study found that 33 percent of 25 to 29-year-olds  live with their parents or their grandparents in 2016, that's almost three  times as many that live with their parents, Dagen, in 1970.  I don't know  about you, but when I was 18, I got out of high school my parents were  like, \"Bye, good luck.  Take care.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  My dad gave me $20 when I graduated from college and said,  \"Hey kiddo, I can't find you a job.  If you get married, here's $20, elope,  I don't want to know about it.\"  Said, \"That's a dowry.\"</p><p>CASONE:  Same story, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Is that exactly what you did?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- yes, actually, about 10 years later.  Thanks Collin for  bringing up that happy memory.  Think of -- what do you think of  millennials living at home?</p><p>JAIN:  Oh, rent is so expensive nowadays.  I mean, this is the problem.   Like you're spending 55, 60 percent of your income in New York on rent,  it's no surprise people were staying at home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You actually have backed a company that's trying to connect the  -- that's trying to ease the down -- the -- not the down payment but the  security deposit.</p><p>JAIN:  Right.  So actually, one of our biggest focuses right now at Kairos  is building new technologies to help reduce the cost of rent.  The one  you're talking about is Rhino.</p><p>One of the problems of renting is not just the monthly recurring cost, just  to move in to a place, you're spending $10,000 plus.  Nobody has that kind  of liquid cash coming out of college.  So we basically created a company  that waive security deposits for folks.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I just moved and it's been a pain in the butt with all upfront  cost and then you have to buy furniture and different things like that,  find a new gym and --</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I suspect you saw that list to the best places for millennials  to live, Minnesota and North Dakota is because the cost of living is so  low.  </p><p>JAIN:  Actually, I also got to find that list.  I don't know who came up  with that.</p><p>BELL:  Well D.C., the technology corridor could be potential driver. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's true, it's not just politics.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're an entrepreneur encore, you can start a business  anywhere, even in North Dakota.  </p><p>JAIN:  I agree with you.  I mean, I just think -- I will be shocked if you  surveyed a random poll of millennials and that that was the order of  favorite cities.</p><p>MCSHANE:  The good shell oil start-up in North Dakota.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Again, the future.  Coming up, all options on the  table, that's the word from the White House as the president looks to show  force against Syria.  </p><p>And you'll be digging deeper this summer to drive and fill up your tank,  gas prices spiking.  We'll tell you why the real sticker shock may be from  your gas station credit card bill.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The art of a trade war, U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers squaring off.  According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. trade  officials are laying blame on Chinese firms for rerouting goods to other  countries to get around tariffs.</p><p>And this coming after China said it would open market and ease some import  tariffs particularly on auto imports.  Futures are looking like this this  morning, again, the selloff is picking up steam, it was a great day for  stocks yesterday.  We have a 181 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p>Joining me from the CME Group, the PRICE Futures Group and FOX News  Contributor, Phil Flynn.  What do you make of this latest development Phil?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think when we're looking at the  difficulties of actually enforcing a potential trade war when it comes to  transshipping.  And if you look at the markets today, we're really trying  to balance the reducing risk of a trade war versus a rising risk of a real  war in Syria.</p><p>So you have a lot of dynamics to play with the markets, a lot of  nervousness.  But actually, I guess I have to say that President Donald  Trump strong line with China appears to be bearing fruit.  And overnight,  of course, President Trump tweeted and basically thanked President Jinping  from China for his kind words on the tariffs and talking about his problems  with intellectual property.  So it looks like President Trump's strong arm  has -- bearing some fruit this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, it's interesting Phil the President Xi's comments, how they  worked into markets yesterday and then no doubt played a role especially in  the stock market in the gains we saw and you're right, we got a talk coming  up I think about Syria that maybe that hasn't affect on today's selloff  that we're seeing.</p><p>But do you think President Xi knew exactly what he was doing there?  In  other words, this is going to be a long drawn out process, these  negotiations and he -- I would bet that he knew by saying what he said that  the markets would react as they react, maybe buys him a little bit of time  too to negotiate.</p><p>FLYNN:  I think he did.  I think he wanted to lower the temperature a  little bit.  If you remember China started the week off really tough,  putting sanctions on U.S. soybeans which was basically their nuclear  options.</p><p>I think President Xi wanted to ratchet down the tensions and basically give  up on what he knows is indefensible.  I think everybody in the world  realizes that the Chinese import tariffs on cars is way out of whack, the  entire world knows that that's indefensible.  The stealing of intellectual  property, everybody's against that.  Everybody knows that China is playing  fast and loose with the rules.</p><p>So I think on the things that were indefensible, he's going to come out and  try to adjust their position and I think it does open the doors for  negotiations and there probably will be no trade war.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From your mouth Phil, thank you so much.  Phil Flynn from CME  Group, we'll see you soon.</p><p>Serious action for Syria, the president weighing a massive military strike  and what that would mean for the United States and our relationship -- our  tense relationship with Russia.  </p><p>And forget Sci-Fi images of the surface of the moon, there's a new 4K view  of the planet that you will not be able to take your eyes off of, that's  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure this morning, we have 179-point loss on the Dow Futures, a  weaker open for stocks is on deck.  Investors are waiting on inflation data  and minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, coming out later today,  maybe its concerns about Syria and a strike, an impending strike.  </p><p>This, coming after a big rally yesterday, China said it would open up its  economy and makes some concessions on the tensed trade relationship the  U.S. has with China.  Checking global market action in Europe, markets are  edging lower.  And in Asia overnight, it was mixed action, the two markets  there that headed south, the Nikkei in Japan and KOSPI in South Korea.   Targeting Syria, President Trump looking to rally support for a possible  missile strike against Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We're going to  continue to work with a number of our partners and allies as we determine  what the next best steps are.  I just saw the troops yesterday.  I don't  have anything new on that front in terms of things that the President may  or may not do.  We are not going to broadcast.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This, as the United States positions warships within firing  range of Syria.  Deadline day, the FBI and justice department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to essentially spying on a  U.S. citizen, Carter Page, that counterintelligence Russia investigation.   The House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, threatening legal  action if law enforcement does not comply.  </p><p>Bank of America, taking action on guns, it will stop lending the gun makers  that produce so-called assault-style weapons for civilians.  Peak driving  season, kicking off in a few weeks, new numbers show you'll be paying more  at the pump, more on that, plus, the fresh warning for drivers over gas  station credit cards.  </p><p>A night, 10 years in the making, one NBA player debuting with a  performance, so good, it could not even have been scripted any better, we  have the highlights, and a whole new way to see space, NASA unveiling a  virtual tour of the moon.  </p><p>But, first, the Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike on Syria, the prospects for U.S. action, rising yesterday,  after Russia rejected a U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate the  alleged chemical weapon's attack.  White House Press Secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  The President has been clear, we're working with our partners and  allies and our National Security team to look at all options and as we've  said, all options are on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of  anything the President may or may not do in response to what's taking place  in Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This coming as a European air traffic control agency is  reportedly alerting airlines to exercise caution due to potential air  strike in Syria in the next three days.  Joining us now, is National  Security Analyst for the Clarion Project, Professor of Counter-Terrorism at  Liberty University, Ryan Mauro.  Ryan, you were previously a volunteer  researching for a Syria opposition group before the Civil War started.   What is your take on this?  What does the U.S. need to do here?</p><p>RYAN MAURO, PROFESSOR OF COUNTER-TERRORISM, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY:  Well, the  immediate objective is to have some type of deterrent effect on Assad, so  that the chemical weapons attacks and other forms of attacks, like the  barrel bombs, can be stopped.  </p><p>And that's very doable because he has a weak air force, we have the  capability to strike at his shipments of fuel, the stuff that's coming in  and out of the ports that the Russians have to use, so there's plenty of  targets that are vulnerable, hitting just a handful of them, would have a  dramatic effect on the ground and has to be more than punishment.  </p><p>What has to happen is that the dictator Assad has to actually look at the  situation and say, my chances of losing this war go up when I do things  like this, and therefore I'm going to stop doing it, and that's the  calculation we have to aim for.</p><p>JAIN:  Even if he has Russia on his side, preventing that?</p><p>BELL:  Russia did say, they came out this morning.  I saw a news report  that said they would retaliate, they would look to stop any missiles coming  to Syria and they would strike any places where those missiles were coming  from.</p><p>MAURO:  We've heard that every time there's been some type of confrontation  with a Russian ally, that's, kind of, just how they talk.  And if you look  at what happened with the air strike last year, we gave a warning to the  Russians.  They got their people out so that there weren't casualties.   There was an arrangement.  And giving that heads-up, doesn't really make  much of a difference if you're going after hard targets because you can't  pick those up and that's really what you're going after.</p><p>MCSHANE:  This is more aggressive than that (INAUDIBLE) what you're talking  about is a step-up from what we did last year, so there has to be more risk  involved, no?</p><p>MAURO:  There is.  Any time you have a greater number of strikes, there's a  greater number of risks, obviously, especially if it's missiles coming from  the sea and hitting these parts, especially the shipments, so that you  can't get supplies in and out, that's very doable and it's not something  that Russia's going to want the risk a war over.  Will they try to shoot  down some cruise missiles, maybe launch a cyber-attack?  Probably, because  Putin always has, at the end of the day, be able to say, look, there's a  proof that America is weak and I'm the future of the world, give him that,  you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is the -- what is the end objective here?  Because we had  one strike on an airfield last year, there was a chlorine gas attack  earlier this year, in January, which our response was, essentially a letter  from the state department.  There was no force taken, at all, and that  sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, does it not?  So what is the end  objective to essentially take out the air force, Assad's air force here?</p><p>MAURO:  That's what I think it's going to be.  It may not be the explicit  objectives, they'll say no more planes in the sky at all, but it'll be at  least cripple it to the point where there is a difference on the ground and  that advantage is lost by Assad and that increases the pressure on him.  </p><p>And in the past, when it looked like Assad was going to lose significant  territory, the Russian tone did change, they would said, we like Assad,  he's our friend, but we are not dedicated only to him, and you would  actually have people opposed to Assad that were going over to Russia.  So,  Russia wants a puppet state, they want a military base there, and they  think Assad is a loser, they will look to somebody else.  So, I don't rule  out the possibility of cooperating with the Russians in the future, if we  handle this very carefully.</p><p>MCSHANE:  This coalition -- I'm sorry, the coalition --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what I want to ask.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  fairly easy, I mean, do you think that (INAUDIBLE) France, like  the U.K., Saudi Arabia?</p><p>MAURO:  Coalition is done.  So many people hate Assad, that that's just a  matter of few phone calls.  I am concerned of what allies we get involved  in this, like, Qatar.  As opposed an ally, that supports every enemy of  ours, Turkey, especially, Turkey always demands that we ditch our allies,  the Kurds, and their reliance that includes Christians.  </p><p>So, I get worried about the influence of these partners giving us bad  advice for their own selfish aims.  But, I think we should, particularly,  Northern Syria, double down on the Kurds and their alliance there because  you're actually seeing the beginnings of a Democratic future in that part  of Syria.  It's an amazing story that's not told.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just one last thing before we move onto another topic, but in  terms of Syria, does this mean the U.S. is not getting out of Syria, as  President Trump --again, President Trump linked that to ISIS being on the  run, but this is the most serious problem for the Syrian people, is the  leader who is still there, are we there for, maybe, even a few years to  come?</p><p>MAURO:  Oh, yes, definitely, because even if he were to go back to original  position, say look, Assad is not a concern anymore, my concern is just  ISIS.  There are terrorist groups even worse than ISIS right now, in Syria,  including Al-Qaeda which basically has an army of 20 to 25,000 people that  they've never had before, and there are other groups.  So, any foreign  policy that focuses solely on ISIS, is problematic, maybe because I see  what's coming around the corner and it could be worse.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And i was critical for years of the foreign policy in the  position of the Obama administration that they created this power vacuum  overseas and the suggestion that we are getting out of Syria would do the  very same thing.</p><p>MAURO:  And it's a terrible signal to send also, especially when you don't  have benchmarks and say, we're going to accomplish A,B, and C, before that  happens.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I want to move on, Ryan, switch gears to back here at  home, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, calling out the  Justice Department for failing to provide an unredacted two-page document,  this is an electronic communication used to formally begin the Russia  probe, the California Congressman laying out the potential consequences  last night on the Ingraham Angle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I did just tell you that we're not going to just hold and contempt, we will  have a plan to hold and contempt and to impeach.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Rob Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, your reaction to that?</p><p>MAURO:  This type of stuff drives me crazy with the government  bureaucracies, because whether they are trying to cover up something or  they're just being difficult.  This is actually a threat to our democracy.   Move beyond the issue of Trump and the politics of the day, this is the  type of thing that members of congress, researchers like myself, encounter  constantly, you ask for something reasonable.  </p><p>They refuse to give it to you, they'll fight to the death, but not give it  to you, and when you get it, it's a redacted piece of paper with, like, two  words, the and a, and then you have to go over and fight it over again.   There is a major crisis of transparency in the government that this is  touching upon beyond the politics of today with the whole probe with  Russia.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So, I wondering, though,  just listening what Nunes said there,  if there's some -- if there's some, or at least is worth questioning,  whether or not there's some aspect of Nunes during the President's bidding  here on the question over Rosenstein and the question of Christopher Wray,  the President has talked openly about in the last few days of getting rid  of, for lack of a better term.  </p><p>So, that's -- I mean, that's where -- and Nunes was talking about on a  different subject, but he said, we won't hold back, we don't go after these  guys and none of those two were related.  It's going to be interesting to  watch when you think of that though.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But if they did their job, it wouldn't be (INAUDIBLE) it was  Wray and Rosenstein, did their job and didn't act like they were, kind of,  hide something about this investigation.  It would be a moot point and you  could make that connection with President and his legal problems and what's  going within the FBI and the JOY, in terms of, well, stonewalling.</p><p>MAURO:  I agree, and just all the parties involved in this, I'm really,  greatly, disappointed because you're a supporter of the President or you're  against them.  Whoever's representing you right now, the dialogue that goes  along with it, I find to be destructive.  I mean, the morale, right now,  the FBI deal, you deal with FBI personal constantly.  I've never seen it so  low.  </p><p>And so, even from Trump's side, some of the rhetoric come seeing -- it  really does bother me when I see how that impacts people who sacrificed a  lot, not just risking their lives, but look at what this type of services  does to marriages, their families, sacrificed a lot.  </p><p>And then they'd get basically branded as an agency, as a whole, as being  politicized or corrupt.  And by the way, we're talking about classified  information, so that's why I don't make these final assessments as, oh,  what happened or didn't happen because 90 percent what you're talking  about, is not available to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MAURO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks for being here.  You covered a lot of ground for us, Ryan  Mauro.  Coming up, brace yourself before you put the pedal to the metal.   This summer, gas prices are on the rise, but apparently not as high as the  interest on your gas station credit card, we will explain.  And hope dreams  do come true, one basketball player delivering a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bank of America entering the gun control debate.  Cheryl Casone  has more on this story, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, they are, Dagen.  The bank it's going to stop lending to  companies that produce military-style firearms for civilian use -- an  attempt to curb mass shootings.  The bank telling gunmakers and doesn't  want to underwrite or finance these firearms.  And its told the number of  gun manufacturers that will no longer do business with them.  Shares of  Bank of America are slightly lower; down almost one percent in the  premarket. </p><p>Well, get ready to pay more at the pump this summer.  The government  estimates prices could jump as much as 14 percent to average of $2.74 a  gallon nationwide.  You can blame the expected increase on OPEC and Russia  which agreed to cut production in 2016, and those cuts have been extended  through the end of this year.  Regular gas right now hitting its price of  the year, $2.66 a gallon for the week.  Well, a new study is finding that  gas credit cards carry much higher interest rates than regular credit  cards.  Creditcards.com is reporting that average rate for gasoline credit  cards, 24 percent.  The national average for general credit card is about  17 percent.  </p><p>And flying to the moon has never been so easy and so cheap thanks to NASA.   We now have the opportunity to tour our closest neighbor in 4k high depth.   This new video shows images that have been collected over the last nine  years by NASA's lunar orbiter.  It gives us an extremely detailed look at  the moon's surface.  What's very cool?  You can see the sight of Apollo  17's rover and lunar landing -- completely, Dagen, untouched, since 1972.   So, I know you were thinking: oh, great, a cheap flight to the moon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You know, we actually have somebody who can talk about  traveling to the moon onset.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I actually was born the year that we landed on the moon.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know it's sad.  </p><p>JAIN:  In fact, we own a company called Moon Express and we're actually  sending the first private rockets to the moon at the end of this year, just  to get -- you're talking about regulations and tariffs and all this.  Our  primary mission to the moon is actually the mind for platinum and bring it  back.  And we had to go through so many hoops to get the White House and  Congress to approve sending anything past Earth's orbit, and the next  battle is going to be: how to bring stuff back.  So, it's all fun and games  to play around with the virtual reality of the moon, but it's going to be  really, really fun when we get to send people to the moon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Any suggestions on who we want to send or not bring back?  </p><p>BELL:  How soon are we be doing this?</p><p>JAIN:  It's the first unmanned rocket.  Probably, at the end of the year.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where are you launching from?  Where's the launch?  </p><p>JAIN:  NASA actually gave us the basic Cape Canaveral, where the original  Apollo mission launch.  So, it's going to be a nice, kind of, historic  moment.  We're thinking about timing, it would be -- at 2019, next year. </p><p>MCSHANE:  yeah.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's fantastic.  Ankur, thank you for sharing that with us.  </p><p>JAIN:  Exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it also inspires young people to be entrepreneurs and  literally reach for the star.  </p><p>Breaking news, President Trump just tweeted this: \"So much fake news about  what is going on in the White House.  Very calm and calculated with the big  focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting  and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.  Feels great to have  Bolton and Larry K. (Larry Kudlow) on board.  I (we) are doing things that  nobody thought possible despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia  investigation which takes tremendous time and focus.  No collusion or  obstruction other than I fight back.  So, now, they do the unthinkable and  raid a lawyer's office for information.  BAD!\"  All caps, exclamation  point.  </p><p>Coming up, Sister Jean's rock star status continues, despite Loyola  Chicago's heartbreaking the final four.  This time, the sister is blessing  the Chicago Cubs with the first pitch.  Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The L.A. Lakers are not going to the NBA playoffs but they gave  us quite a Hollywood story last night.  Jared Max is here to explain,  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  This one reminds me  of the NBA version of the 2002 baseball movie, \"The Rookie\".  Remember  Dennis Quaid for a trade and aging pitcher, who finally got shot in big  leagues?  Andre Ingram, who spent 10 years in the NBA Developmental League,  playing in small cities, traveling often by bus to stay in the game.  At  age 32, Ingram made his NBA debut last night.  Lakers fans at Staples  Center went batty.  Ingram's story book night's on and hit his first four  shots, include the three all three points.  He shot six of eight from the  field.  Scored 19 points, blocked three shots, the crowd even chanted MVP,  MVP.  Ingram scored more points in his NBA debut than any player in the  last 50 seasons -- a dream come true.  Remember, Linsanity, Jeremy Lin, who  lit up in Knicks in the NBA six season ago.  Overnight super star from the  minor leagues, Lin tweeted: \"Anyone who has chased hoop dreams can  appreciate this, too good.\"  Playoffs start Saturday, by the way.  </p><p>Just over two months since the Alabama Crimson Tide won college football's  national championship.  The team met with President Trump yesterday at the  White House.  And forget about players protesting, Head Coach Nick Saban  reportedly held a team meeting and said we're doing this regardless of your  political beliefs.  Saban was asked if called any recruits from the White  House.  Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NICK SABAN, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA:  Absolutely.  I  mean, why wouldn't I?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many?  </p><p>SABAN:  Probably half a dozen.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  From the oval?  </p><p>SABAN:  No, no, I -- from -- I get these rooms confused around here.  So,  but it was in the White House, and it was good.  But I didn't want to have  any violations if the president talks to any recruits for us.  That would  have been the NCAA would have jumped all over that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Like you hear the president say roll tide yesterday.  Changes is  coming to some NFL uniforms next season.  The color rush monochrome jerseys  we've seen teams wear on Thursday night games, last couple of seasons.  It  won't be a Thursday staples.  Teams get more flexibility now to wear these  color rush jerseys where they want, and also maybe change them.  Oh, hey,  look who threw the ceremonial first pitch yesterday at Wrigley Field?  For  the Cubs home opener along with members of the Loyola Chicago basketball  team, the NCAA Cinderella's Sister Jean, age 98, puts the ball in play.   Unfortunately, for Cubs' fans, the Pirates won.  (INAUDIBLE) the players  from Loyola squad, of course, saying the take me out to the ball game --  the tradition.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a better pitch than I've seen in some and delivered it  at games.  </p><p>BELL:  For a 98-year-old.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCSHANE:  It was a good pitch for a 98-year-old woman.  Do we have data to  compare that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I turned to Connell.  Connell's first's job was -- he was of  baseball -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Baseball play by play, right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's was the first --</p><p>MCSHANE:  I throw the first pitch from, and that was, yes, not as good as  Sister Jean.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Since you're here, Connell, I'm going to give you a NASCAR  story.  Kyle Busch --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's warming hearts around the world.  He surprised a young fan  at an In and Out drive through.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KYLE BUSCH, RACE CAR DRIVER, NASCAR:  Can you -- that kid in the yellow  sweatshirt right over there? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?</p><p>BUSCH:  Can you give it to him?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course.</p><p>BUSCH:  Thank you.  All right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good job today.  </p><p>BUSCH:  I appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Dagen, so often stars, it doesn't matter what field you're in, go  running from their fans.  I love to see Kyle Busch's attitude all the time.   He wants to sign somebody's R.V., he likes to pop in and surprise people.   He saw the kid was wearing his number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, he's wearing a Kyle Busch sweatshirt, it looks like,  because those are Kyle's color.  And he had a big win at a Texas motor  speedway over the weekend.  But again, these NASCAR drivers actually don't  get recognized.  Because they're very average looking, so.  </p><p>MAX:  No, helmets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What?</p><p>MAX:  Nothing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, no helmets.  Thank you, Jared. </p><p>MAX:  I'm up for double-double right.  I'll have an In and Out double- double burger.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How far do you have to drive for In and Out?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  California.</p><p>MAX:  I don't know.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Not bad for a 98-year-old, Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jared's sports report, Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.   Still ahead, eating like a snake can help you lose weight.  That's the  theory behind a new trendy diet.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, April 11th.  </p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. eastern.</p><p>The bulls trying to fight back -- they did yesterday, a 428-point gain on  the Dow yesterday.  We had gains across the board.  The biggest mover of  those three market gauges was the Nasdaq composite gaining more than 2  percent.</p><p>Yesterday with some comment very early in the morning East Coast time from  China's President Xi Jinping who promised to open that market and cut  tariffs on auto imports.</p><p>The Dow swung more than 300 points during the trading day for the 14th  straight time marking the longest such stretch ever.</p><p>And also with some good news on Capitol Hill with Mark Zuckerberg doing an  A -- A minus, A plus job even testifying in front of those senators.</p><p>It's a different story this morning, futures are showing losses -- 177  point loss on the Dow futures right now.  Some concerns about what will  happen with Syria and when the U.S. with partners will strike.</p><p>In Europe stocks mostly lower, losses across the board there.</p><p>And it was mixed markets in Asia with Shanghai and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong but gaining half of 1 percent.</p><p>One of the top winners yesterday was, as I said, Facebook -- shares seeing  their largest gain in two years up 4.5 percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced  a grilling on Capitol Hill on everything from the Cambridge Analytica  scandal, Russian election interference, bias toward conservative news.   Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  The most important thing that I care about  right now is making sure that no one interferes in the various 2018  elections around the world.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he's set  to testify before House lawmakers.  Fox Business will bring you live  coverage starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Immigration battle -- yet another California town taking on the state,  challenging sanctuary city laws.

That's where -- I am not wrong.  He was - - </p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  No, I was there.  I was part of Tinder for a  while after signing the last company to them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So based on that, Mark Zuckerberg -- he is really -- he's an  admirable performer.  </p><p>JAIN:  He really did -- as you say, he did a great job.  I think the big  question now is do the congressmen have the ability to ask the right  questions?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  No.</p><p>JAIN:  And if they don't are they in the right place to set the  regulations?  And if not how do the tech companies work with Congress to  make sure the right regulations get in place?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad privacy protections are the consensus there -- </p><p>JAIN:  And transparency, I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's been said for years.  Facebook was reckless.  They were  reckless.  They didn't protect people.  They didn't tell people how their  data was being used properly.  And now this is what happens.</p><p>JAIN:  Well, it's like -- Facebook's 14 years old, it's like when was the  last time a teenager made all the right decisions?  And I think, you know - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He tried to drop that excuse referencing his dorm room.  Come  on, move on -- Mark.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Move on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  But you don't (INAUDIBLE) outsmart these guys for one day and you  know more about your own industry than they do doesn't necessarily mean  you're going to evade regulation, long term.  I'm thinking about -- I was  covering the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case for a while and there's a lot of jokes  going back and forth among reporters that the judge didn't understand the  technology.  Well, the judge has a number of clerks that may understand the  technology.  </p><p>These Senators and congress people have a number of aides that may  understand the technology.  So that's part of this, too.</p><p>JAIN:  Anyway -- I do think that at the end of the day Facebook is open to  regulation.  So is Google, so is Apple.  So everybody wants to move this  floor in a productive way.  It's just a matter of doing it in the right  process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well said but I would like them to cut the let's all join hands.   It's the summer love mantra coming out of Facebook.</p><p>Breaking news -- President Trump has tweeted this, moments ago on Syria,  \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready,  Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  You shouldn't  be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.\"   Strong words from President Trump.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we're going to speak with House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling; House Judiciary Committee  member Congressman Ted Poe; former Republican presidential candidate Herman  Cain will be here; and Dr. Mikhail Varshavski -- Dr. Mike.</p><p>But right here, right now we have the judge standing by to talk about one  of our top stories this morning.  We were talking about Facebook and the  testimony from Zuckerberg yesterday.  But let's talk about Facebook's role  in the Russia meddling probe. </p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed during that testimony that the tech titan is  working with Special counsel Robert Mueller.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I assume Facebook has been served with subpoenas from  special counsel Mueller's office.  Is that correct?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the  special counsel's office?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you been interviewed?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  Let me clarify that.  I actually am not aware of  a subpoena.  I believe that there may be.  But I know we're working with  them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me right now Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- just your thoughts.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well, sometimes  when the government wants information it breaks down doors like it did to  the doors of the Trump Organization at 5:30 in the morning to get to  Michael Cohen's records on the inside.  And sometimes it just says Mr.  Zuckerberg, can we speak to your people?  No search warrant, no FBI agents,  no guns drawn, no subpoena.</p><p>So I would imagine that they used a softer approach with Mr. Zuckerberg's  people than they did with Michael Cohen.  Meaning they sent some FBI agents  there to engage in what appeared to be friendly conversations about how --  tell us how you know who is placing these ads.  Are these Russians?  Are  these people who are pretending to be Americans?</p><p>Give us the technology.  Talk us through it.  And they probably willingly  did and he might be personally unfamiliar -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with the conversation.  He may think it's pursuant to a  subpoena.  My guess is it is probably just a friendly request.  The  government comes knocking and they ask you to talk to them, you can say  yes, you can say no.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But my reaction to that was I wonder if people will be upset  that without a subpoena that Facebook potentially hands over or reveals  private information that's on the network because I just go back to Apple.   And Apple fighting tooth and nail in the court system to avoid rewriting an  operating system to allow the FBI in to look at the San Bernardino killer's  phone.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My buddies at the FBI were not happy with me but I cheered  Apple on, they did the exact right thing for their customers.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- and I realize now why Apple did it.  I realize  now because now Tim Cook has two strong legs to stand on -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in terms of protecting people's privacy.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  Now, we don't know -- Senator Leahy in my view asked  the right questions.  He could have gone deeper but I don't know that Mark  Zuckerberg would have known the answer.  We don't know exactly what  information Bob Mueller's people, FBI agents, got from the Facebook team --  whether they got personal private information.</p><p>Theoretically, theoretically, if Facebook received a subpoena for Dagen  McDowell's account they would notify you to give you and your lawyers the  opportunity to negotiate the subpoena or to ask a judge to quash it.  I say  theoretically.  That doesn't always work that way.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And it didn't -- I mean it's not -- I mean it's not apples to  apples on the comparison but id didn't work that way in the Cambridge  Analytica case, right.  And that's where it got brought up a little bit  yesterday and that's why -- I think that's sort of at the heart of this  matter is what are we as users of Facebook -- there's so much focus  yesterday on how they use their data for advertising.  That's their  business model -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  -- but what are we as users of Facebook have a right to know.  So  if there's a breach of my data, somebody gets my credit card information,  that day the bank's telling me, hey they got your credit card, you need to  get a new card.</p><p>Whereas in the Cambridge Analytica case, they took forever to call.  They  didn't tell anybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out something real quick.  This is beyond - - to understand what Facebook was doing -- from 2007 until 2015, it's not  about Cambridge Analytica.  It's about your information being accessed by a  friends' app -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And no one knew -- no one knew that any app developer was  accessing your information.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Fully agreed -- fully agreed and you know, we are talking  about a private entity here that has agreements with the Federal Trade  Commission to inform Connell if for example there was a breach of your  account and the failure to do that result in a fine, sounds small, but do  the math of $40,000 per breach.   </p><p>JAIN:  You had 87 million breaches -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  Do the math, 710 that is a huge number even for  Zuckerberg.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, that consent decree was put in place two years  before they actually ended the practice of letting all the app developers  access the information from not only the app users but the friends of the  app users.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  All right.  Can I talk to you about delicious irony?  These  senators ranting and raving about Facebook violating privacy, what is the  greatest violator of personal privacy on the planet?  The federal  government.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTIGATION STRATEGIST, CFRA:  The government.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government that they run and that they fund and that they  authorize.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>JAIN:  No, we were just -- we were just saying that.  I mean the amount of  data -- what data does the federal government not have access to anyway  they are looking for from Facebook for this particular case.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that there is an answer to that question.  They  can get everything.</p><p>JAIN:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They know everywhere I go when this is with me, every  conversation I had, even when you and I talk in the greenroom, every e-mail  that I send and every text that I send.  It's not just me.  It's all of us.</p><p>JAIN:  Everyone is worried about Facebook listening to your microphone but  the Feds actually have the ability to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  The judge is worked up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge, not that that helps.</p><p>But the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke about  Mueller's investigation yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein oversees the special counsel and only  he has the power to fire the special counsel.  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, we've been  advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  these comments of course, after the FBI raided the office, the  home and the hotel room of longtime personal attorney to President Trump,  Michael Cohen.  That raid has raising questions about attorney-client  privilege.  What about firing Mueller in that as well?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Ok.  Let's start with firing Mueller.  There are areas of the  law that are very clear.  Go 30 miles an hour in front of the Fox Building,  you get a ticket because the speed limit is 25.  There's really no dispute.   The cops have discretion if you're doing 25 and 30.</p><p>Can the President of the United States fire a special counsel?  The law is  unclear.  There is a federal regulation that governs the Justice Department  that says specifically only the appointing authority, in this case Rod  Rosenstein, can fire the special counsel and it has got to be for cause.</p><p>There is other authority that says the President runs the executive branch  of the government and he can fire whoever he wants for any sound reason, a  person in the executive branch that's not protected by civil service.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President could rescind that law that gives Rosenstein the  authority to fire him, could he?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No.  Only Congress can.  It is in the CFR.  It's easy for  Congress to do that, the Code of Federal Regulations but it would require  Congress to do that.  That law comes about -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JAIN:  -- the investigation. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has never been tested before.  But when Richard Nixon had  Professor Archibald Cox fired, he directed his attorney general to do it,  the attorney general resigned.  He directed the number two person at DOJ to  do it.  That person resigned.  He directed the number three person to do  it, Bob Bork of notoriety later on in life.  He fired the special counsel  and was replaced by another special counsel as we know undid the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we should also point out that it was revealed last week the  Mueller probe, they don't view President Trump as a criminal target.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They view him as a subject.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A subject but not -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You could go from subject to target -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It could change.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- like that.  </p><p>Now here is what is interesting -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- if I could between the lines, in the weeds, whatever phrase  you want to use about what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday.  They did  research.  They dispatched lawyers to give them a legal opinion, the White  House as to whether or not the President of the United States on his own  bypassing the AG, bypassing the deputy attorney general could single- handedly fire Bob Mueller and their research told them yes.</p><p>Why did they do that research?  It remains to be seen.  </p><p>BELL:  Wouldn't he rather prefer to fire Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would that look better.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and was confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>He can fire Rod Rosenstein just like he could fire any cabinet officer.   Politically it would be damaging but legally he could do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You better show me how to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to make you laugh before you went. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure -- guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Such a pleasure, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Fox Business Network will bring you Zuckerberg's testimony live at 10:00  a.m.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news -- a plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  We're just getting some new  numbers then -- Dagen.  Good morning.</p><p>An Algerian military jet has crashed near the country's capital killing at  least 257 people.  The plane came down near a military base shortly after  it took off.  Authorities there say some survivors have been rescued.  It  is not clear what caused this crash but it's the worst plane crash in  Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet went down killing 102 people.</p><p>Well, let's head back home to south Florida, that state hit by two  tornadoes.  The National Weather Service says the first one struck downtown  Fort Lauderdale yesterday afternoon packing winds of up to 65 miles an hour  -- look at that.  The twister knocked out power, thousands delayed hundreds  of flights out of the airport there.</p><p>The second tornado touched down near Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Airport  about an hour later with winds topping out at 84 miles an hour.  One of the  runways was closed for more than two hours while crews picked up all of the  debris.  Look at those crushed metal.</p><p>Well, Chevrolet is stepping up its challenge to Ford, showing off its next- generation Silverado and it is enormous.  2020 Silverado HD is going to  built in Flint, Michigan.  It's going to roll off the production line in  the third quarter of 2019.  Ford has dominated the pickup truck segment and  Chevy is hoping hopes to close the gap with three new Silverado's.  Shares  of General Motors are down 7 percent so far this year.</p><p>Ok.  Chick-Fil-A has won top-rankings of food quality and customer service.   Now, it looks like they've won over teenagers.  And a survey of teens from  Piper Jaffray, Chick-Fil-A beat out chains including, get this, Starbucks,  Chipotle, even McDonald's.  Chick-Fil-A has an established following in the  south.  Now, the chain is gaining fans in places like New York City because  it's right down that street, and the Midwest.  In 2017 Chick-Fil-A reported  one of the $9 billion in revenue up more than a billion from 2016.  And by  2020 Chick-Fil-A is expected by some analysts to be the third largest  restaurant chain in the United States by sales anyway -- Dagen.</p><p>And true story, when I was in high school I worked at Chick-Fil-A.  Yes, at  the mall in Phoenix, Arizona and then they found out that I was lying about  my age and they fired me.  But it was a fun couple of weeks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, people love Chick-Fil-A because the people who  operate the franchises and the people who work there are nice. </p><p>CASONE:  They're nice.  Yes.  The food is good.  Chicken is good.  Like I  said, down the street.  I know you won't go there but I might -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a giant one down at the Fulton Street Market -- </p><p>CASONE:  New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the biggest in the country, by the way.  </p><p>CASONE:  New Yorkers love it, man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, New Yorkers do like nice people.  </p><p>Coming up easing tensions over tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping  sparking a rally yesterday with comments on the opening up about the  economy.  We'll look at the chances that we avoid trade war.</p><p>And a whole new meaning to watching the scales -- why doctors are warning  the snake diet is going viral.  You don't eat snakes -- we will explain  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The art of trade war -- U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers going head to head.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" U.S.  trade official are laying blame on Chinese metal firms for rerouting goods  to other countries like Vietnam in order to skirt tariffs.  This coming  after Chinese President Xi Jinping said that he would open markets and ease  some import tariffs yesterday.</p><p>Futures are looking like this, this morning.  We ought to point out that  the futures took a turn even lower with a 268-point loss on the Dow futures  right now right after President Trump sent out that tweet on Syria about  Russia.</p><p>So I want to point out that that is why you are seeing the selling pick up  steam as we move a little bit more than two hours away from the opening  bell.</p><p>Joining me now is Payden &amp; Rygel chief economist Jeffrey Cleveland -- what  to make of the trade issue.  That seems to have been rocking markets  lately.  But this all started -- the volatility came back with a vengeance  in early February because of concerns about inflation and higher interests  rates.  So what is it?  </p><p>JEFFREY CLEVELAND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PAYDEN AND RYGEL:  Well, I think the  trade story is like so many narratives in the market, you know, people get  really attached to them it becomes -- it dominates headlines and then it  goes away because we make too much of it.</p><p>That is how I remember last year and the Fed's balance sheet story,  remember how the Fed was going to shrink its balance sheet and that it was  going to be a big deal.  That didn't happen.</p><p>Before that, you know, you had things like the fiscal cliff.  So I think  that is what, for me, the trade story is.  It doesn't change our overall  growth outlook.  </p><p>BELL:  But is that true though because you are immediately seeing impact to  steel prices, pork prices, soybean prices. So that is impacting the farmers  in the Midwest. But then when does it creep into sentiment numbers for the  consumer for businesses.  I know small business sentiment was at a new high  in the most recent reading.  So I feel like once it creeps into those  numbers you could really start to see an economic impact.  </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I think you're exactly right.  If you look at -- you do  have market moves.  You have volatility.  The question is does that feed  into the actual economic data.  The earliest read of that I think would be  a small business survey which has come off a little from the highs but it's  still very elevated.</p><p>So I don't think the market volatility has bled through into the economic  outlook.  And I think the story really is going back to the inflation  story.  I mean we had that shock early February with the jobs report, the  average hourly earnings number.  I think that's set off a re-pricing in the  bond market which bled through into equities.</p><p>So it's really for me the inflation story that's driving everything here,  and I think today -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  We get the CPI today.  The core is expected to be 2.1 percent  by Bloomberg's latest survey.  That's the first time, it is ever 2 percent  in a handful of months at least.  I'm not exactly sure what's your take on  that if we get that more than 2 percent number.  </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I mean I don't want to make too much of it.  This is not  the 1970s.  This is stagflation or anything like that.  I do think 2.1  percent -- that 2 percent is a real critical threshold for the bond market  because the 2 percent is the number that the Fed is targeting.  So if, you  know, the bond market has been complacent for months because inflation was  low, it was sub 2 percent, you suddenly get above 2 percent, just  psychologically, I think that changes the game.</p><p>And then people start looking around.  You know, how it works, looking  around they start seeing inflation everywhere.  So they're going to start  seeing it in the aluminum prices, in oil prices.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they're going to see it at the pump this summer.</p><p>CLEVELAND:  Exactly -- gasoline prices.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that changes sentiment because again, that's one inflation  gauge that people relate to from East Coast to West Coast.  </p><p>BELL:  It's the consumers wall -- Jamie Dimon has been really warning about  the potential for higher inflation going forward too, to this.  Maybe it  could be just the beginning.</p><p>We are getting into earnings season and a lot of the bulls are hanging  their hat on earnings really being what is going to calm this market.  Do  you believe that we'll get a look at the fundamentals?</p><p>CLEVELAND:  You know, I think near-term I do worry that the inflation story  will surprise the market.  We will get another repricing in interest rates  that will have a knock-on effect on the equity market.  So there's a short  term.  So that's -- I think over the next three months, let's say.</p><p>Longer-term, what I'm worried about is -- and what I'm going to focus on is  do we continue to see the unemployment rate fall?  If the unemployment rate  falls below 4 percent I think that is good for the consumer, I think that's  good for earnings.  </p><p>So it's really that story that I think over the, you know, the six to 12  month timeframe that will be more important.  And I think that will happen.   I think the unemployment rate falls below 4 percent in the next few months.   And that's fantastic.</p><p>We have only been that low on the unemployment rate three times in the  post-war era -- late 60s, late 90s for a few months, and the late 50s.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jeffrey -- good to see you.  Jeffrey Cleveland -- </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Payden and Rygel.  Take care -- </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and we will be watching again.

Your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure amid rising tensions with Syria.  President Trump warning  earlier this hour that missiles will be coming.  And you are seeing those  concerns show up in the stock market in the Futures.  We have a 257 point  loss on the Dow Futures.

The investors are also  waiting on inflation data, consumer prices, and the minutes from the  Federal Reserve latest meeting, You'll going to get that this afternoon.

But the  actor who is set to star as the late politician, I promise you it will  surprise you.  </p><p>Our top story this half hour, escalating tensions between the United States  and Russia.  The Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike against the Assad regime.  But now Futures are extending  losses after President Trump's tweet earlier.  Here's what the President  said on Twitter.  'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia because they will be coming.  Nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.'  This coming after Moscow voted against a U.N.  resolution yesterday to investigate Saturday's suspected chemical attack  that killed dozens of people in Syria.  Joining me now is the member of the  House Committees on Judiciary and Foreign Affairs, Texas Congressman Ted  Poe.  Congressman Poe, your reactions to very strong words from the  President.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  Well, the President wants the Russians and really  the Syrians to know now where we stand on this issue.  Chemical weapons,  the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law.  The  Russians and the Syrians agreed a year or two ago to get rid of all of the  chemical weapons out of Syria.  They lied.  They're still there and they're  being used against the people of Syria.  There has to be consequences for  this violation of international law and the President is going to have a --  I suspect a targeted strike into Syria in retaliation for the use of  chemical weapons.  There are many options that's are available down the  road, most of them are not very good and the fact that I don't think most  Americans want a full military invasion of Syria.  I don't think that's  going to happen.  Targeted strike to get their attention is something that  I think the President's going to do and I support him in that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.  So, to your point, if the tweet is a directive, we are going  down the road of military action against Syria, there's almost no doubt  about it after the President's comments, Congressman this morning.  So  targeted strike to get their attention, once you have it, then what?   What's the goal?  </p><p>POE:  Well, the goal is to immediately have them quit using chemical  weapons.  Now, that has not worked in the past.  They went ahead and used  chemical weapons anyway.  So, there has to be some retaliation to the  Syrians and to the Russians and don't forget the Iranians.  The Iranians  are involved in all of this too, who've murdered their own people.  And  what that will be, I hope is something that will cease and desist on the  use of chemical weapons in the Civil War in Syria.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how big is the --</p><p>POE:  The United States is not going -- the United States is not going to  topple the regime, remove Assad.  That's not going to happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Despite the air -- the strike on that air base, that airfield  last year, there's a lot that the United States has not done to really go  after Bashar al-Assad.  I'll point to a chlorine gas attack earlier this  year, killed more than 20 people, mostly children and that warranted what  was essentially a statement from Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state,  that was saying that it was no denying that Russia by shielding its Syrian  ally has breached its commitment to the United States as a framework  guarantor, this is about the U.N. deal some years ago brokered by the Obama  administration.  </p><p>But again, we didn't strike.  And Bashar al-Assad read that as quite  frankly, weakness and that he would pay no price.  We've also did not stop  Iran from establishing a new military presence on the border with Israel in  Syria.  So, how big does this message need to be?  Do we need to take out  the entire air force of Bashar al-Assad?  </p><p>POE:  What we do really, I think is something that the military and the  President need to decide.  But it has to be strong enough to keep the  Russians, the Iranians and the Syrians from using chemical weapons on their  own people.  And that it has to be the message that we send to them.  Assad  is I think going to stay in power.  It's not our plan to remove him.  I do  not see the United States using a full military invasion of Syria, but I  think a strike will be strong enough to say look, you have to cease and  desist.  The Russians and the Iranians and the Syrians, they cannot be  trusted.  They are using this as a proxy war to really influence, have  their own Russian and Iranian influence in Syria with Assad as their  puppet.  But that needs to be strong.  And I think it will be strong when  the President decides what exactly to do in military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now, do they heat the sanctuary show down, another  California City voting overnight to join the Justice Department law suit.   Challenging the so-called sanctuary state law.  Watch as residents in  Orange County take a bold stance against the policy limiting cooperation  between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT:  Anybody for (INAUDIBLE) doesn't realize we're  talking about criminals here, not refugees, not immigrants, criminals.   We're going to deport them and that's just too bad if you don't like it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Members of the National Guard in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas  have already begun arriving at the southern border.  The California has not  yet complied with President Trump's request.  Congressman, your thoughts on  this? </p><p>POE:  It's a smart move on the part of the President to put the National  Guard on the border.  I'm from Texas.  And we had the National Guard down  there a few years ago.  And it worked.  It stopped people from crossing  into the United States.  So, I totally support that idea because it's  something that has worked in the past.  Now, one thing that we need to do  as a nation is remember, we have to protect the border and the border is  the middle of the Rio Grande River.  </p><p>And once people cross that middle and come into the United States, they're  already in the United States.  So, our philosophy needs to be keep people  from crossing.  Therefore, we need boats in the water, down the middle of  the Rio Grande River and we also need the aerostats, cameras and those kind  of things to prevent people from crossing in the first place.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  We are showing a graphic that says border  apprehensions in March did surge, up more than 200 percent year over year  but they had been dramatically falling since the year 2000, in fact.  I  believe last year they were at the lowest level since 1971.  So, the action  by this administration is in response to those apprehensions going up in  recent months.  I want to get your reaction, Congressman, President Trump  is quite busy this morning, just tweeting this about Russia.  \"Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been.  And that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together.  Stop the arms race.\"  </p><p>Congressman, your reaction to that?  Because again, this President more  than any other has been attacked by people on the left, people in the media  for being light on Russia, again pushing that narrative of collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia and his actions and words have both  been incredibly strong at laying down what he feels about Russia, Russia  interference and Russian aggression.  </p><p>POE:  Well, there are people in the media who are obsessed with hating on  Trump and they will use anything they can to do so.  And Russia is one of  the examples.  Look at the big picture.  The President has been tough on  Russia and he's going to continue to be tough on Russia because Russia is a  bully.  They lie about their foreign policy.  They have invaded crime  media, they have invaded Eastern Ukraine, they have invaded Georgia with no  consequences.  And they're going to continue.  </p><p>I think Putin is going to continue when he finds an opportunity to move  into somebody else's country and try to put troops there.  The President of  the United States recognizes that, and we need to -- and he sees the  importance of making sure that Russia is not an aggressor nation like it  wants to be.  In his talk is tough and also his actions are tough of  removing spies from the United States, sending them back home where they  belong.  And I think it is a new day in the relationship with Russia is  that we need to get tough on Russia.  But Russia needs to work with the  west and they refuse to do so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think, one thing that did not get enough attention were  the sanctions on Putin's rich cronies and their ability to do business  sanctions on their assets, lending their ability to do business.  That hits  somewhere it hurts and ultimately that might change Putin's behavior.  But  again, not much coverage of what the Treasury Department did last week.   Congressman, it's good to see you.  Congressman Poe from Texas.  Take care.  </p><p>POE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a cheap repair could cost you in the long run.  Why  iPhone owners may want to think twice before using a third party to fix a  broken screen.  And Hollywood taking Toronto, the unexpected choice set to  play controversial ex-mayor Rob Ford in an upcoming movie.  He looks more  like Connell McShane.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a hint.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets under pressure this morning amid rising tensions with  Russia and Syria.  The President Trump has been tweeting this hour about  this relationship and about Syria and here's what he had to say.  'Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together to stop the arms race.'  Earlier this  hour he said 'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  </p><p>Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming.  Nice and new and, \"smart\".   You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.'  What has been the reaction in the markets?  Futures  are lower, 230-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, but loss is kind of  equal losses on all three major market gauges in the Futures market so far  this morning.  And that selling is picking up steam because of those  tweets.  Meantime, Apple loses a major patent infringement case.  Cheryl  Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes Dagen, another stock to watch today as  well.  Shares of VirnetX surging since the Federal Jury in Texas said that  Apple must pay that security software company $500 million over infringed  patents.  And the Jury ruled that Apple's FaceTime, its VPN and its Demand  on iMessage features infringe four of VirnetX patents.  The imagers based  on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices.  This is a big one.   Meanwhile, there is more iPhone problems to tell you about.  A new update  disables iPhone eight devices that have screens that were at some point  repaired by a third party.  The update renders the touch screen useless.   The only option, you have to replace the screen again and Apple has to do  it.  A similar problem happened with the iPhone seven.  That was fixed,  though.  Anyway, another stock to watch going to be Apple today.  It's  slightly lower in the premarket.  </p><p>OK, here's something for you.  Especially if you fly a lot, Airbus may have  come up with the next big thing in travel on long range flights.  Bunk beds  in the cargo hold.  You're looking at the rendering of this idea.  They  plan to include this on the A330 and A350 jets by 2020.  Airbus is also  looking at offering a children's play area, complete with a playground, a  slide, and even hospital rooms on-board.  Passengers (INAUDIBLE) passengers  would have to be buckled in and seated during take-off and landing.  Shares  of Airbus are up more than 15 percent.  I said this on \"FBN:AM\" this  morning Dagen (INAUDIBLE) the story that basically, I don't know, they'll  put the play room and the beds side-by-side.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't play in the streets.  Play in a \"sleeping berth\" which  they haven't cleaned for the last 80 flights (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm hoping they clean them.  I'm hoping they clean them.  OK  really quick one more.  Billion-star Damian Lewis reportedly set to play  Toronto's controversial former mayor Rob Ford in a new movie.  Hollywood  reporter is saying that the 47-year-old British actor has been cast to play  the mayor.  The movie is going to be called \"Run This Town\".  Remember Ford  died from cancer back in 2016.  But he made international headlines 2013  when a cell phone video showed him smoking crack cocaine.  Dagen, here's  the thing, Damian Lewis is a really small guy, I mean, he's a slight guy,  he's a good-looking guy but he's a thin man.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We call him \"Billions\", he was on \"Homeland\".  I was trying to  say that the guy cast to play Rob Ford looks more like Connell than Rob  Ford.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, I was wondering about that.  I was wondering who's it going  to be actually.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the tease.</p><p>MCSHANE: (INAUDIBLE) it could be a lot worse speaking Dagen's past  pronounced. With it could be a lot worse. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and I -- He's a fine actor.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  He is a good actor.  He's a very good actor.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can he play Rob Ford?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I don't know if anyone can play Rob Ford.  We miss -- we miss old  Rob Ford.  He was -- he was an original.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know who could play Rob Ford?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Who?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris Farley.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, it's not going to happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, may he rest in peace.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's not going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have to get you to watch \"Billions\".</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I love \"Billions\".  I got to get you to watch  \"Billions\".</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I do, it's on my list.</p><p>JAIN:  Catch up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On Showtime.  We'll be right back, everybody.  Coming up next,  shedding your winter skin, the health issues behind the viral new trend  dubbed Snake Diet.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Favorite story of the day.  Can eating like a snake help you  lose weight?  There is a new fad diet called the Snake Diet.  Participants  drink nothing but apple cider vinegar with mineral replacements for two  days and then go on a flexible fasting routine.  The diet founder claims  say it is similar to how snakes eat.  The critics of the diet claim it is  dangerous and will not produce long-term results.  Joining me now is Doctor  Mikhail Varshavski.  Better known as Doctor Mike.  Tell us what you think  about this.  </p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, FAMILY MEDICINE:  I will say this, at the  outset right away, this is not a healthy diet.  This is not going to give  you any kind of results.  It's probably going to be dangerous for your  health and the person who created this diet, his name is Cole Robinson,  actually has a video on Youtube where he talks about it.  It's borderline  psychopath behavior.  He's calling people fatties.  He's screaming about  how you're supposed to eat like a snake and it's in our nature.  He makes  wild claims that it's going to cure type two diabetes, inflammation,  herpes.  </p><p>None of this is substantiated by science.  And I'm so passionate about  this, I just gave it, had talked about six months ago on this type of  experts.  They're IKA experts, I know all.  They think they understand  everything there is to know about science research and doctors don't know  what they're doing.  When in reality what they do is they take fringe  scientific research, weak scientific research, combine it and pull it  together and think that they've created the next new magical fact.  And  this is an example of it, the Snake Diet which is just complete, complete  garbage.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I call it, you know, it's not attention seeking behavior, I call  them attention seeking dolts, ASD.  But by the way, let me just clear  something up.  Because I, I'm a reptile freak.  A snake, like a six-foot  diamond carpet python eats once every two weeks, it drinks water and it  will eat one medium size rat.  It should be dead and frozen and then  thawed.  Otherwise the rat might bite the snake.  But it eats one rat every  two weeks. </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, that's not a diet for anybody but --  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Look, this gentleman basically claims that prolonged fasting  will help you lose weight.  Yes, eating less will help you lose weight.   But you don't need to do it so drastically.  Because number one, you won't  stick with such a crazy, strict diet.  People who have comorbidities or  other illnesses like diabetes or heart failure if they follow his dry  fasting or salt water fasting routine.  They'll overload the fluid --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's the problem, no, here's the problem, if you starve me and  tell me to fast, I'm not going to act like a snake.  I will turn into a  fire-breathing dragon.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's kind of weird.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what, I'm sitting -- I get really irritable.  Hungry.   Hungry.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You got to hold and knock this guy?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Tell me one snake you know that has herpes.  I have to be honest  with you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I can't argue that.  I can't argue that as a doctor.  I don't  know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what?  Snakes do get mites.  They're specific to  snakes, snake mite.  And they're very hard to get rid of.  Dr. Mike, love  you.  It's always great to see you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you so much, appreciate it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like it when you get upset because you're cool about it.   Ankur Jain you have to come back.  Good to see you my friend.</p><p>JAIN:  Great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman Cain is up next hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p>You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.

Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and  the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list.  Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p>CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p>CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p>BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p>BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p>I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p>There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p>The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p>That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p>CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p>Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p>And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p>CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p>BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p>CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p>CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p>CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p>CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p>CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p>CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p>CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p>The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p>CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p>CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p>And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p>Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p>And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p>REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p>SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p>CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p>MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p>CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p>So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p>So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p>And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p>I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p>CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p>CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p>CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p>CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not in the least.  But he got a big job done,  the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the  board of?  No, I don't think so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all over my head.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office?  We'll be right  back, everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks all, Herman Cain.  Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I shall.  Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.  The  President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  April 11th.  Your top stories at 6a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks surging, the Dow climbing more than 400 points yesterday after  China's President Xi Jinping promised an open market and to cut tariffs on  auto imports.  Futures are showing this, 400 plus point gain on the Dow  Futures on the Dow yesterday.  Ninety point loss on the Dow Futures today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, stocks there mostly lower.  Across the board losses in England,  France, and Germany, although slight.  And it was mixed reaction in Asia  overnight with gains in Shanghai and on the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the top winners yesterday, Facebook shares seeing their biggest gain  in two years, up about four and a half percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg did  an admirable job facing a grilling on Capitol Hill from people who clearly  didn't understand Facebook, some of them.  He was grilled on everything,  from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian election interference, you  name it, he was asked it, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens  here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What Mark Zuckerberg's testimony could mean for future  regulation in the tech sector, that's ahead.  He's back on Capitol Hill at  10:00a.m. this morning.  </p><p>Nunes fighting back, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee set  to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director  Christopher Wray as the Justice Department still refuses to provide him  with an unredacted document showing the justification for their Russia  probe.  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol, that's ahead.</p><p>Bank of America changing its stance on firearms.  The bank says it will no  longer lend money to companies that make so-called assault rifles for  civilians.  </p><p>Plus, never give up on your dreams, after spending 10 years in the  development league, on basketball player delivers a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  The incredible story coming up.</p><p>And one small step for man, one giant leap online, NASA helping you channel  your inner Neil Armstrong with a brand new virtual tour of the moon.</p><p>All of that coming up and so much more this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  FOX Business's Connell McShane.  And Kairos  Founder, Ankur Jain.  Ankur, just really quickly, what was your take on  Zuckerberg yesterday?</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I'm going to tell you, Mark did a great job.   I mean, all things considered.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love how you refer to him by his first name.</p><p>JAIN:  But I mean look, I got to tell you, the good thing was I think that  Zuckerberg did a great job for Facebook.  I think the challenge that the  congressmen had no idea what to ask to actually address the problem, and  that's a challenge.  This is an important topic.  And if you're going to  have the Senate sitting there taking the time to figure out what  regulations technology need, they need to know the right questions asked.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, right.  We have another episode of old  people talking technology at 10:00 this morning, right?  They had no idea  how to follow-up was the main point.  </p><p>JAIN:  I mean, honestly some of other was just a lack of understanding what  Facebook is.  Somebody -- I forget which one of the congressman held up a  poster board of five Facebook groups and goes, \"Mr. Zuckerberg, are you --  can you authenticate that these were not owned by Russian trolls?\"</p><p>If I were him, I would have been like, \"There are three billion groups.  I  don't remember every single group.\"  I mean, it's just --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  It's just a shame.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was prepped.  He bought the kind of legal prep that billions  of dollars can buy, put it that way.  And he followed the script that was  handed to him, we'll get into that.  That's what we're talking about, the  top of the show.  </p><p>And coming up this morning, Texas Congressman, House Financial Services  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Texas Congressman Ted Poe.  Former  Presidential Candidate Herman Cain.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  And Dr. Mike, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski on the snake diet,  yes, that's one of our things that we'll be discussing with Dr. Mike.</p><p>But to our top story this hour, Mark Zuckerberg squaring off with lawmakers  on Capitol Hill, the Facebook CEO testifying for about five hours before  skeptical senators who demanded answers on how the social media company  allowed Cambridge Analytica to misuse the personal data up to 87 million  Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DUBIN (D), ILLINIOS, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel  you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p>DUBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DUBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, (INAUDIBLE) in modern  America, \"connecting people around the world.\"</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:   Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today and I say this  gently, your user agreement sucks.  You can spot me 75 IQ points, if I can  figure that, you can figure that.  The purpose of that user agreement is to  cover Facebook's rear-end, it's not to inform your users about their  rights. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors did react positively to Zuckerberg's performance.   Shares of the social media company were up four and a half percent.  Mark  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning.  He is set to testify  before House lawmakers.</p><p>Joining us now, Gabelli Multimedia Trust Portfolio Manager, Larry Haverty.   Larry, my takeaway if -- looking at it from a market perspective and in an  investor perspective is, even without additional regulations which might be  coming, Facebook's going to be spending a lot more money on security, on  policing the content on that social media platform.  Is that fully factored  into the stock, their increase in expenses?</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST:  Well I think  that's the $64,000 question here.  There are two context that I think this  discussion needs to be framed in.  </p><p>The first is the emotional context and that was the theater that the  Congressional grilling provided for viewers yesterday.  Five hours is an  awfully long time and I think Mark did very, very well on that.  I'd give  him an A- grade.  I thought the best answer was the hotel one and I think - - I thought he gave the wrong answer when I heard it but then I thought  maybe it was the right answer because he does need to maintain his personal  security and frankly, it isn't anyone's real business where he stays.</p><p>The second question remains answer -- unanswered though and that's the  financial question.  And you look at what Facebook's doing, they've said  they're going to add 5,000 people, that's a good crowd for a small college  basketball game.  Those people are going to need facilities, I think that's  at least a $1 billion cost, that raises the cost based on Facebook by a  very significant amount.</p><p>Now, this is a company with very, very strong margins.  My guess is that  the margins are going to go down at least 500 points but I think we have to  wait two weeks to more or less figure this out when Facebook reports its  first quarter and I'm pretty sure if the people gave Zuckerberg the advice  they did and he performed as well as he did, the crisis managers are going  to tell them how to handle the earnings release which I think is to be  upfront with the cost on this as much as possible and I think that's not a  hundred percent, they're not going to know until probably a year later how  much they spent.</p><p>They'll clearly be a significant one-time charge but with $41 billion,  that's not a big deal.  Net-net, the stock had been in my opinion, if  nothing went wrong and clearly that's no longer the case.  The stock had  been priced very cheaply relative to its growth and I think it can handle  this once the computers that are trained especially in technology  investments to detest the margin contraction get few -- get through with  selling the stock the minute the numbers come out because I think there  will be margin pressure greater than people expect and I think once the  numbers come out, the first trade will be down on the stock in a couple  weeks.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, what was your take yesterday on what happened?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Well I think the stock  was up because this could have been just a relief rally or maybe it was a  short selling -- a short squeeze, excuse me.</p><p>Larry, I'd love to get your take though, when I think about Facebook, I  wonder about the future of this company because you have Mark Zuckerberg  out there talking to the press saying and -- to senators saying that,  \"Look, we are kind of like a media company, you are seeing expense going  up, you're going to see margin compression.\"  Trading at 22 times, yes,  that's a huge discount to its historical average but it's still premium to  media companies.  Where is this company going to evolve to?  You've got  Sheryl and Mark talking about paid subscription services, what is the  future of Facebook and what's the right valuation to value that?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, I think the secret sauce here is very important and that's  the first thing I learned about this company and mercifully I learned it  before it went public from talking with some people who did business with  the company.  </p><p>The advertising works and it's very unique.  You have David Ogilvy, one of  the advertising gurus historically 50 percent of advertising works, I just  don't know which 50 percent.  Facebook can prove its efficacy, it's more  efficient than alternatives.  So advertisers, unless there are real, real  major problems are going to embrace it.  They're not going to walk away.  A  few may walk away, my guess is maybe you lose two to three percent on add  volume, you're clearly going to have cautious CPM pricing for the next 12  months and then I think the systems will write themselves but this company  has a tremendous comparative advantage versus comp.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  CPM being called for million (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Tremendous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cost for thousand views (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes, cost for thousand.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your take on what you heard about regulation from  these senators yesterday because it's not going to be just Facebook.  As an  entrepreneur, are you worried about Washington getting in the way of  innovation and creation?</p><p>JAIN:  So I think -- look, let's break it out.  One, Zuck said himself that  Facebook is open to the right kind of regulation.  I think secondly, it's  really not the Facebook problem, right?  I mean, Google has as much or more  data on users than Facebook does.</p><p>The question is, what's the right kind of regulation?  After watching the  Congress yesterday ask their questions, I worry that if they're left to  create regulation it will do things that stifle innovation and actually  block the services that actual people --</p><p>MCSHANE:  We never got to that question about what the -- I mean, maybe we  did.  I mean, to the entire -- to whatever else, five or six hours but what  I saw, it never got to your question which is what is the right type of  regulation.  </p><p>I think Kamala Harris, the senator from California maybe came closest and  she tried to press him, I think it was in the 6:00 hour Eastern Time  talking about Cambridge Analytica data breach.  It's like, why didn't you  tell the users about that?  He's like, \"We know that they are taking our  data, we know they're using it for advertising to make it more targeted.\"   But once there's a breach, why weren't the users told about that and what  type of regulation can help prevent that in the future?  And he dodged.</p><p>JAIN:  I think the common theme you saw throughout Zuck's testimony was  transparency.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  And I think that is ultimately where the right regulation goes, is  that as long as these companies are transparent about what they're doing  with data, what's happening with the data, I think at that point, the  user's decisions on how much they want to give Facebook, how much they want  to use Facebook, et cetera.  And so, hopefully the Congress will lean  towards that kind of regulation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I will end on this note, one, Sheryl Sandberg needs the same  kind of grilling from the legal team that Mark Zuckerberg does because,  again, her kind of like flip hair-toss reaction to what's been going on at  Facebook for the last decade is a little dismissive to investors and two,  what was ironic was listening to those senators asks Mark Zuckerberg those  questions was the equivalent of watching my 82-year-old father try to use  Facebook.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That he was like -- it was the equivalent of like flicking the  phone like there's a bug on it and then dimming the screen to the point  that he throws the phone at you and tells you he -- that Facebook broke his  phone, that's what it felt like.</p><p>JAIN:  If Facebook does have access to people's car records, I'd love for  them to release how many Congressmen called their grandkids that morning  and say, \"Can you please quickly walk me through Facebook before I  interview this Mark guy.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  It's embarrassing.  A bunch of times it's embarrassing.  It  was -- I mean, it's almost like when we do an interview with someone, you - - a lot of times you know the subject, you're ready to follow-up like this.   But if you're not -- if you don't know the topic, you can ask the first  question, forget about the follow-ups and that was -- what happened a ton  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But fear the wiley southerner because I think Lindsey Graham  acted all folksy and very foghorn leghorn but then he backed Mark into  trying to basically asking him if you have a monopoly.  And so I thought  that he used -- he was like, \"Go ahead, assume that I'm stupid because I'm  from the south\" and then he went in for the kill shot.</p><p>JAIN:  It was definitely smart at some point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you Ankur.  Larry, it was great to have you here,  terrific analysis as always, please come back very, very soon Larry  Haverty.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And keep it here on FOX Business for live coverage of Mark  Zuckerberg's testimony before House lawmakers today, starts at 10:00a.m.  Eastern Time.  </p><p>Meantime, Bank of America's big move against guns, the bank won't lend to  companies that make so-called assault weapons for civilian use.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>And time is up, House Intel share Devin Nunes is done waiting for the FBI  and DOJ to hand over Russia probe documents.  And now he says it's time for  someone at the top to face serious consequences.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sprint and T-Mobile talking about a merger again.  Cheryl Casone  has the detail, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, really Dagen.  The third fourth largest  U.S. wireless carriers are back in the negotiating table again.  The merger  would lump together 127 million customers and get some serious competition  to Verizon and AT&amp;T, that nation's top two providers.</p><p>T-mobile and Sprint were in talks before but those ended because the  (INAUDIBLE) valuation disagreements between the two companies.  Since then,  Sprint stock has taken a dive, it lost about a fifth of its value.  The  company has long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Shares of T-mobile  are also down nearly six percent year-to-date.  So, we shall see.</p><p>Theranos is making some major job cuts, report say the blood testing firm  laying off almost everybody that works there in an effort to keep the  company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoffs chopped the company's  workforce from 125 to about two dozen employees, that is way down from  2015, they had 800 people there at the time.  Founder and CEO Elizabeth  Homes has announced the staffing changes nearly a month after settling  civil fraud charges with the SEC which forced her to give a voting control  over her own company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, WalletHub has released its annual list of best places to live for  millennials.  Here are the top three states, Minnesota ranked high on the  list coming in at number three.  North Dakota coming in at number two,  these are very cool places.  And then get this, the top spot not  technically a state but it's the nation's capital.  According to the study,  Washington, D.C. the best place for millennials to live.</p><p>Millennials make up 35 percent of D.C.'s workforce, key indicators of  living standards like average monthly earnings for millennials and, of  course, the unemployment rate for them were looked at.  D.C. millennials  say that the abundance of people their age is also a big attraction for  moving there.  So, staying with the younger generation, looks like young  adults, the share of them that are living with their parents is right now  at the highest in 75 years.  This is depressing parents.  </p><p>A few research center study found that 33 percent of 25 to 29-year-olds  live with their parents or their grandparents in 2016, that's almost three  times as many that live with their parents, Dagen, in 1970.  I don't know  about you, but when I was 18, I got out of high school my parents were  like, \"Bye, good luck.  Take care.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  My dad gave me $20 when I graduated from college and said,  \"Hey kiddo, I can't find you a job.  If you get married, here's $20, elope,  I don't want to know about it.\"  Said, \"That's a dowry.\"</p><p>CASONE:  Same story, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Is that exactly what you did?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- yes, actually, about 10 years later.  Thanks Collin for  bringing up that happy memory.  Think of -- what do you think of  millennials living at home?</p><p>JAIN:  Oh, rent is so expensive nowadays.  I mean, this is the problem.   Like you're spending 55, 60 percent of your income in New York on rent,  it's no surprise people were staying at home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You actually have backed a company that's trying to connect the  -- that's trying to ease the down -- the -- not the down payment but the  security deposit.</p><p>JAIN:  Right.  So actually, one of our biggest focuses right now at Kairos  is building new technologies to help reduce the cost of rent.  The one  you're talking about is Rhino.</p><p>One of the problems of renting is not just the monthly recurring cost, just  to move in to a place, you're spending $10,000 plus.  Nobody has that kind  of liquid cash coming out of college.  So we basically created a company  that waive security deposits for folks.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I just moved and it's been a pain in the butt with all upfront  cost and then you have to buy furniture and different things like that,  find a new gym and --</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I suspect you saw that list to the best places for millennials  to live, Minnesota and North Dakota is because the cost of living is so  low.  </p><p>JAIN:  Actually, I also got to find that list.  I don't know who came up  with that.</p><p>BELL:  Well D.C., the technology corridor could be potential driver. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's true, it's not just politics.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're an entrepreneur encore, you can start a business  anywhere, even in North Dakota.  </p><p>JAIN:  I agree with you.  I mean, I just think -- I will be shocked if you  surveyed a random poll of millennials and that that was the order of  favorite cities.</p><p>MCSHANE:  The good shell oil start-up in North Dakota.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Again, the future.  Coming up, all options on the  table, that's the word from the White House as the president looks to show  force against Syria.  </p><p>And you'll be digging deeper this summer to drive and fill up your tank,  gas prices spiking.  We'll tell you why the real sticker shock may be from  your gas station credit card bill.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The art of a trade war, U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers squaring off.  According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. trade  officials are laying blame on Chinese firms for rerouting goods to other  countries to get around tariffs.</p><p>And this coming after China said it would open market and ease some import  tariffs particularly on auto imports.  Futures are looking like this this  morning, again, the selloff is picking up steam, it was a great day for  stocks yesterday.  We have a 181 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p>Joining me from the CME Group, the PRICE Futures Group and FOX News  Contributor, Phil Flynn.  What do you make of this latest development Phil?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think when we're looking at the  difficulties of actually enforcing a potential trade war when it comes to  transshipping.  And if you look at the markets today, we're really trying  to balance the reducing risk of a trade war versus a rising risk of a real  war in Syria.</p><p>So you have a lot of dynamics to play with the markets, a lot of  nervousness.  But actually, I guess I have to say that President Donald  Trump strong line with China appears to be bearing fruit.  And overnight,  of course, President Trump tweeted and basically thanked President Jinping  from China for his kind words on the tariffs and talking about his problems  with intellectual property.  So it looks like President Trump's strong arm  has -- bearing some fruit this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, it's interesting Phil the President Xi's comments, how they  worked into markets yesterday and then no doubt played a role especially in  the stock market in the gains we saw and you're right, we got a talk coming  up I think about Syria that maybe that hasn't affect on today's selloff  that we're seeing.</p><p>But do you think President Xi knew exactly what he was doing there?  In  other words, this is going to be a long drawn out process, these  negotiations and he -- I would bet that he knew by saying what he said that  the markets would react as they react, maybe buys him a little bit of time  too to negotiate.</p><p>FLYNN:  I think he did.  I think he wanted to lower the temperature a  little bit.  If you remember China started the week off really tough,  putting sanctions on U.S. soybeans which was basically their nuclear  options.</p><p>I think President Xi wanted to ratchet down the tensions and basically give  up on what he knows is indefensible.  I think everybody in the world  realizes that the Chinese import tariffs on cars is way out of whack, the  entire world knows that that's indefensible.  The stealing of intellectual  property, everybody's against that.  Everybody knows that China is playing  fast and loose with the rules.</p><p>So I think on the things that were indefensible, he's going to come out and  try to adjust their position and I think it does open the doors for  negotiations and there probably will be no trade war.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From your mouth Phil, thank you so much.  Phil Flynn from CME  Group, we'll see you soon.</p><p>Serious action for Syria, the president weighing a massive military strike  and what that would mean for the United States and our relationship -- our  tense relationship with Russia.  </p><p>And forget Sci-Fi images of the surface of the moon, there's a new 4K view  of the planet that you will not be able to take your eyes off of, that's  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure this morning, we have 179-point loss on the Dow Futures, a  weaker open for stocks is on deck.  Investors are waiting on inflation data  and minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, coming out later today,  maybe its concerns about Syria and a strike, an impending strike.  </p><p>This, coming after a big rally yesterday, China said it would open up its  economy and makes some concessions on the tensed trade relationship the  U.S. has with China.  Checking global market action in Europe, markets are  edging lower.  And in Asia overnight, it was mixed action, the two markets  there that headed south, the Nikkei in Japan and KOSPI in South Korea.   Targeting Syria, President Trump looking to rally support for a possible  missile strike against Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We're going to  continue to work with a number of our partners and allies as we determine  what the next best steps are.  I just saw the troops yesterday.  I don't  have anything new on that front in terms of things that the President may  or may not do.  We are not going to broadcast.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This, as the United States positions warships within firing  range of Syria.  Deadline day, the FBI and justice department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to essentially spying on a  U.S. citizen, Carter Page, that counterintelligence Russia investigation.   The House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, threatening legal  action if law enforcement does not comply.  </p><p>Bank of America, taking action on guns, it will stop lending the gun makers  that produce so-called assault-style weapons for civilians.  Peak driving  season, kicking off in a few weeks, new numbers show you'll be paying more  at the pump, more on that, plus, the fresh warning for drivers over gas  station credit cards.  </p><p>A night, 10 years in the making, one NBA player debuting with a  performance, so good, it could not even have been scripted any better, we  have the highlights, and a whole new way to see space, NASA unveiling a  virtual tour of the moon.  </p><p>But, first, the Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike on Syria, the prospects for U.S. action, rising yesterday,  after Russia rejected a U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate the  alleged chemical weapon's attack.  White House Press Secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  The President has been clear, we're working with our partners and  allies and our National Security team to look at all options and as we've  said, all options are on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of  anything the President may or may not do in response to what's taking place  in Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This coming as a European air traffic control agency is  reportedly alerting airlines to exercise caution due to potential air  strike in Syria in the next three days.  Joining us now, is National  Security Analyst for the Clarion Project, Professor of Counter-Terrorism at  Liberty University, Ryan Mauro.  Ryan, you were previously a volunteer  researching for a Syria opposition group before the Civil War started.   What is your take on this?  What does the U.S. need to do here?</p><p>RYAN MAURO, PROFESSOR OF COUNTER-TERRORISM, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY:  Well, the  immediate objective is to have some type of deterrent effect on Assad, so  that the chemical weapons attacks and other forms of attacks, like the  barrel bombs, can be stopped.  </p><p>And that's very doable because he has a weak air force, we have the  capability to strike at his shipments of fuel, the stuff that's coming in  and out of the ports that the Russians have to use, so there's plenty of  targets that are vulnerable, hitting just a handful of them, would have a  dramatic effect on the ground and has to be more than punishment.  </p><p>What has to happen is that the dictator Assad has to actually look at the  situation and say, my chances of losing this war go up when I do things  like this, and therefore I'm going to stop doing it, and that's the  calculation we have to aim for.</p><p>JAIN:  Even if he has Russia on his side, preventing that?</p><p>BELL:  Russia did say, they came out this morning.  I saw a news report  that said they would retaliate, they would look to stop any missiles coming  to Syria and they would strike any places where those missiles were coming  from.</p><p>MAURO:  We've heard that every time there's been some type of confrontation  with a Russian ally, that's, kind of, just how they talk.  And if you look  at what happened with the air strike last year, we gave a warning to the  Russians.  They got their people out so that there weren't casualties.   There was an arrangement.  And giving that heads-up, doesn't really make  much of a difference if you're going after hard targets because you can't  pick those up and that's really what you're going after.</p><p>MCSHANE:  This is more aggressive than that (INAUDIBLE) what you're talking  about is a step-up from what we did last year, so there has to be more risk  involved, no?</p><p>MAURO:  There is.  Any time you have a greater number of strikes, there's a  greater number of risks, obviously, especially if it's missiles coming from  the sea and hitting these parts, especially the shipments, so that you  can't get supplies in and out, that's very doable and it's not something  that Russia's going to want the risk a war over.  Will they try to shoot  down some cruise missiles, maybe launch a cyber-attack?  Probably, because  Putin always has, at the end of the day, be able to say, look, there's a  proof that America is weak and I'm the future of the world, give him that,  you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is the -- what is the end objective here?  Because we had  one strike on an airfield last year, there was a chlorine gas attack  earlier this year, in January, which our response was, essentially a letter  from the state department.  There was no force taken, at all, and that  sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, does it not?  So what is the end  objective to essentially take out the air force, Assad's air force here?</p><p>MAURO:  That's what I think it's going to be.  It may not be the explicit  objectives, they'll say no more planes in the sky at all, but it'll be at  least cripple it to the point where there is a difference on the ground and  that advantage is lost by Assad and that increases the pressure on him.  </p><p>And in the past, when it looked like Assad was going to lose significant  territory, the Russian tone did change, they would said, we like Assad,  he's our friend, but we are not dedicated only to him, and you would  actually have people opposed to Assad that were going over to Russia.  So,  Russia wants a puppet state, they want a military base there, and they  think Assad is a loser, they will look to somebody else.  So, I don't rule  out the possibility of cooperating with the Russians in the future, if we  handle this very carefully.</p><p>MCSHANE:  This coalition -- I'm sorry, the coalition --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what I want to ask.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  fairly easy, I mean, do you think that (INAUDIBLE) France, like  the U.K., Saudi Arabia?</p><p>MAURO:  Coalition is done.  So many people hate Assad, that that's just a  matter of few phone calls.  I am concerned of what allies we get involved  in this, like, Qatar.  As opposed an ally, that supports every enemy of  ours, Turkey, especially, Turkey always demands that we ditch our allies,  the Kurds, and their reliance that includes Christians.  </p><p>So, I get worried about the influence of these partners giving us bad  advice for their own selfish aims.  But, I think we should, particularly,  Northern Syria, double down on the Kurds and their alliance there because  you're actually seeing the beginnings of a Democratic future in that part  of Syria.  It's an amazing story that's not told.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just one last thing before we move onto another topic, but in  terms of Syria, does this mean the U.S. is not getting out of Syria, as  President Trump --again, President Trump linked that to ISIS being on the  run, but this is the most serious problem for the Syrian people, is the  leader who is still there, are we there for, maybe, even a few years to  come?</p><p>MAURO:  Oh, yes, definitely, because even if he were to go back to original  position, say look, Assad is not a concern anymore, my concern is just  ISIS.  There are terrorist groups even worse than ISIS right now, in Syria,  including Al-Qaeda which basically has an army of 20 to 25,000 people that  they've never had before, and there are other groups.  So, any foreign  policy that focuses solely on ISIS, is problematic, maybe because I see  what's coming around the corner and it could be worse.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And i was critical for years of the foreign policy in the  position of the Obama administration that they created this power vacuum  overseas and the suggestion that we are getting out of Syria would do the  very same thing.</p><p>MAURO:  And it's a terrible signal to send also, especially when you don't  have benchmarks and say, we're going to accomplish A,B, and C, before that  happens.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I want to move on, Ryan, switch gears to back here at  home, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, calling out the  Justice Department for failing to provide an unredacted two-page document,  this is an electronic communication used to formally begin the Russia  probe, the California Congressman laying out the potential consequences  last night on the Ingraham Angle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I did just tell you that we're not going to just hold and contempt, we will  have a plan to hold and contempt and to impeach.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Rob Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, your reaction to that?</p><p>MAURO:  This type of stuff drives me crazy with the government  bureaucracies, because whether they are trying to cover up something or  they're just being difficult.  This is actually a threat to our democracy.   Move beyond the issue of Trump and the politics of the day, this is the  type of thing that members of congress, researchers like myself, encounter  constantly, you ask for something reasonable.  </p><p>They refuse to give it to you, they'll fight to the death, but not give it  to you, and when you get it, it's a redacted piece of paper with, like, two  words, the and a, and then you have to go over and fight it over again.   There is a major crisis of transparency in the government that this is  touching upon beyond the politics of today with the whole probe with  Russia.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So, I wondering, though,  just listening what Nunes said there,  if there's some -- if there's some, or at least is worth questioning,  whether or not there's some aspect of Nunes during the President's bidding  here on the question over Rosenstein and the question of Christopher Wray,  the President has talked openly about in the last few days of getting rid  of, for lack of a better term.  </p><p>So, that's -- I mean, that's where -- and Nunes was talking about on a  different subject, but he said, we won't hold back, we don't go after these  guys and none of those two were related.  It's going to be interesting to  watch when you think of that though.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But if they did their job, it wouldn't be (INAUDIBLE) it was  Wray and Rosenstein, did their job and didn't act like they were, kind of,  hide something about this investigation.  It would be a moot point and you  could make that connection with President and his legal problems and what's  going within the FBI and the JOY, in terms of, well, stonewalling.</p><p>MAURO:  I agree, and just all the parties involved in this, I'm really,  greatly, disappointed because you're a supporter of the President or you're  against them.  Whoever's representing you right now, the dialogue that goes  along with it, I find to be destructive.  I mean, the morale, right now,  the FBI deal, you deal with FBI personal constantly.  I've never seen it so  low.  </p><p>And so, even from Trump's side, some of the rhetoric come seeing -- it  really does bother me when I see how that impacts people who sacrificed a  lot, not just risking their lives, but look at what this type of services  does to marriages, their families, sacrificed a lot.  </p><p>And then they'd get basically branded as an agency, as a whole, as being  politicized or corrupt.  And by the way, we're talking about classified  information, so that's why I don't make these final assessments as, oh,  what happened or didn't happen because 90 percent what you're talking  about, is not available to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MAURO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks for being here.  You covered a lot of ground for us, Ryan  Mauro.  Coming up, brace yourself before you put the pedal to the metal.   This summer, gas prices are on the rise, but apparently not as high as the  interest on your gas station credit card, we will explain.  And hope dreams  do come true, one basketball player delivering a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bank of America entering the gun control debate.  Cheryl Casone  has more on this story, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, they are, Dagen.  The bank it's going to stop lending to  companies that produce military-style firearms for civilian use -- an  attempt to curb mass shootings.  The bank telling gunmakers and doesn't  want to underwrite or finance these firearms.  And its told the number of  gun manufacturers that will no longer do business with them.  Shares of  Bank of America are slightly lower; down almost one percent in the  premarket. </p><p>Well, get ready to pay more at the pump this summer.  The government  estimates prices could jump as much as 14 percent to average of $2.74 a  gallon nationwide.  You can blame the expected increase on OPEC and Russia  which agreed to cut production in 2016, and those cuts have been extended  through the end of this year.  Regular gas right now hitting its price of  the year, $2.66 a gallon for the week.  Well, a new study is finding that  gas credit cards carry much higher interest rates than regular credit  cards.  Creditcards.com is reporting that average rate for gasoline credit  cards, 24 percent.  The national average for general credit card is about  17 percent.  </p><p>And flying to the moon has never been so easy and so cheap thanks to NASA.   We now have the opportunity to tour our closest neighbor in 4k high depth.   This new video shows images that have been collected over the last nine  years by NASA's lunar orbiter.  It gives us an extremely detailed look at  the moon's surface.  What's very cool?  You can see the sight of Apollo  17's rover and lunar landing -- completely, Dagen, untouched, since 1972.   So, I know you were thinking: oh, great, a cheap flight to the moon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You know, we actually have somebody who can talk about  traveling to the moon onset.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I actually was born the year that we landed on the moon.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know it's sad.  </p><p>JAIN:  In fact, we own a company called Moon Express and we're actually  sending the first private rockets to the moon at the end of this year, just  to get -- you're talking about regulations and tariffs and all this.  Our  primary mission to the moon is actually the mind for platinum and bring it  back.  And we had to go through so many hoops to get the White House and  Congress to approve sending anything past Earth's orbit, and the next  battle is going to be: how to bring stuff back.  So, it's all fun and games  to play around with the virtual reality of the moon, but it's going to be  really, really fun when we get to send people to the moon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Any suggestions on who we want to send or not bring back?  </p><p>BELL:  How soon are we be doing this?</p><p>JAIN:  It's the first unmanned rocket.  Probably, at the end of the year.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where are you launching from?  Where's the launch?  </p><p>JAIN:  NASA actually gave us the basic Cape Canaveral, where the original  Apollo mission launch.  So, it's going to be a nice, kind of, historic  moment.  We're thinking about timing, it would be -- at 2019, next year. </p><p>MCSHANE:  yeah.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's fantastic.  Ankur, thank you for sharing that with us.  </p><p>JAIN:  Exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it also inspires young people to be entrepreneurs and  literally reach for the star.  </p><p>Breaking news, President Trump just tweeted this: \"So much fake news about  what is going on in the White House.  Very calm and calculated with the big  focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting  and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.  Feels great to have  Bolton and Larry K. (Larry Kudlow) on board.  I (we) are doing things that  nobody thought possible despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia  investigation which takes tremendous time and focus.  No collusion or  obstruction other than I fight back.  So, now, they do the unthinkable and  raid a lawyer's office for information.  BAD!\"  All caps, exclamation  point.  </p><p>Coming up, Sister Jean's rock star status continues, despite Loyola  Chicago's heartbreaking the final four.  This time, the sister is blessing  the Chicago Cubs with the first pitch.  Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The L.A. Lakers are not going to the NBA playoffs but they gave  us quite a Hollywood story last night.  Jared Max is here to explain,  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  This one reminds me  of the NBA version of the 2002 baseball movie, \"The Rookie\".  Remember  Dennis Quaid for a trade and aging pitcher, who finally got shot in big  leagues?  Andre Ingram, who spent 10 years in the NBA Developmental League,  playing in small cities, traveling often by bus to stay in the game.  At  age 32, Ingram made his NBA debut last night.  Lakers fans at Staples  Center went batty.  Ingram's story book night's on and hit his first four  shots, include the three all three points.  He shot six of eight from the  field.  Scored 19 points, blocked three shots, the crowd even chanted MVP,  MVP.  Ingram scored more points in his NBA debut than any player in the  last 50 seasons -- a dream come true.  Remember, Linsanity, Jeremy Lin, who  lit up in Knicks in the NBA six season ago.  Overnight super star from the  minor leagues, Lin tweeted: \"Anyone who has chased hoop dreams can  appreciate this, too good.\"  Playoffs start Saturday, by the way.  </p><p>Just over two months since the Alabama Crimson Tide won college football's  national championship.  The team met with President Trump yesterday at the  White House.  And forget about players protesting, Head Coach Nick Saban  reportedly held a team meeting and said we're doing this regardless of your  political beliefs.  Saban was asked if called any recruits from the White  House.  Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NICK SABAN, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA:  Absolutely.  I  mean, why wouldn't I?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many?  </p><p>SABAN:  Probably half a dozen.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  From the oval?  </p><p>SABAN:  No, no, I -- from -- I get these rooms confused around here.  So,  but it was in the White House, and it was good.  But I didn't want to have  any violations if the president talks to any recruits for us.  That would  have been the NCAA would have jumped all over that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Like you hear the president say roll tide yesterday.  Changes is  coming to some NFL uniforms next season.  The color rush monochrome jerseys  we've seen teams wear on Thursday night games, last couple of seasons.  It  won't be a Thursday staples.  Teams get more flexibility now to wear these  color rush jerseys where they want, and also maybe change them.  Oh, hey,  look who threw the ceremonial first pitch yesterday at Wrigley Field?  For  the Cubs home opener along with members of the Loyola Chicago basketball  team, the NCAA Cinderella's Sister Jean, age 98, puts the ball in play.   Unfortunately, for Cubs' fans, the Pirates won.  (INAUDIBLE) the players  from Loyola squad, of course, saying the take me out to the ball game --  the tradition.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a better pitch than I've seen in some and delivered it  at games.  </p><p>BELL:  For a 98-year-old.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCSHANE:  It was a good pitch for a 98-year-old woman.  Do we have data to  compare that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I turned to Connell.  Connell's first's job was -- he was of  baseball -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Baseball play by play, right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's was the first --</p><p>MCSHANE:  I throw the first pitch from, and that was, yes, not as good as  Sister Jean.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Since you're here, Connell, I'm going to give you a NASCAR  story.  Kyle Busch --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's warming hearts around the world.  He surprised a young fan  at an In and Out drive through.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KYLE BUSCH, RACE CAR DRIVER, NASCAR:  Can you -- that kid in the yellow  sweatshirt right over there? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?</p><p>BUSCH:  Can you give it to him?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course.</p><p>BUSCH:  Thank you.  All right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good job today.  </p><p>BUSCH:  I appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Dagen, so often stars, it doesn't matter what field you're in, go  running from their fans.  I love to see Kyle Busch's attitude all the time.   He wants to sign somebody's R.V., he likes to pop in and surprise people.   He saw the kid was wearing his number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, he's wearing a Kyle Busch sweatshirt, it looks like,  because those are Kyle's color.  And he had a big win at a Texas motor  speedway over the weekend.  But again, these NASCAR drivers actually don't  get recognized.  Because they're very average looking, so.  </p><p>MAX:  No, helmets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What?</p><p>MAX:  Nothing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, no helmets.  Thank you, Jared. </p><p>MAX:  I'm up for double-double right.  I'll have an In and Out double- double burger.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How far do you have to drive for In and Out?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  California.</p><p>MAX:  I don't know.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Not bad for a 98-year-old, Jared.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jared's sports report, Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.   Still ahead, eating like a snake can help you lose weight.  That's the  theory behind a new trendy diet.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, April 11th.  </p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. eastern.</p><p>The bulls trying to fight back -- they did yesterday, a 428-point gain on  the Dow yesterday.  We had gains across the board.  The biggest mover of  those three market gauges was the Nasdaq composite gaining more than 2  percent.</p><p>Yesterday with some comment very early in the morning East Coast time from  China's President Xi Jinping who promised to open that market and cut  tariffs on auto imports.</p><p>The Dow swung more than 300 points during the trading day for the 14th  straight time marking the longest such stretch ever.</p><p>And also with some good news on Capitol Hill with Mark Zuckerberg doing an  A -- A minus, A plus job even testifying in front of those senators.</p><p>It's a different story this morning, futures are showing losses -- 177  point loss on the Dow futures right now.  Some concerns about what will  happen with Syria and when the U.S. with partners will strike.</p><p>In Europe stocks mostly lower, losses across the board there.</p><p>And it was mixed markets in Asia with Shanghai and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong but gaining half of 1 percent.</p><p>One of the top winners yesterday was, as I said, Facebook -- shares seeing  their largest gain in two years up 4.5 percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced  a grilling on Capitol Hill on everything from the Cambridge Analytica  scandal, Russian election interference, bias toward conservative news.   Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  The most important thing that I care about  right now is making sure that no one interferes in the various 2018  elections around the world.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he's set  to testify before House lawmakers.  Fox Business will bring you live  coverage starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Immigration battle -- yet another California town taking on the state,  challenging sanctuary city laws.

That's where -- I am not wrong.  He was - - </p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  No, I was there.  I was part of Tinder for a  while after signing the last company to them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So based on that, Mark Zuckerberg -- he is really -- he's an  admirable performer.  </p><p>JAIN:  He really did -- as you say, he did a great job.  I think the big  question now is do the congressmen have the ability to ask the right  questions?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  No.</p><p>JAIN:  And if they don't are they in the right place to set the  regulations?  And if not how do the tech companies work with Congress to  make sure the right regulations get in place?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad privacy protections are the consensus there -- </p><p>JAIN:  And transparency, I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's been said for years.  Facebook was reckless.  They were  reckless.  They didn't protect people.  They didn't tell people how their  data was being used properly.  And now this is what happens.</p><p>JAIN:  Well, it's like -- Facebook's 14 years old, it's like when was the  last time a teenager made all the right decisions?  And I think, you know - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He tried to drop that excuse referencing his dorm room.  Come  on, move on -- Mark.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Move on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  But you don't (INAUDIBLE) outsmart these guys for one day and you  know more about your own industry than they do doesn't necessarily mean  you're going to evade regulation, long term.  I'm thinking about -- I was  covering the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case for a while and there's a lot of jokes  going back and forth among reporters that the judge didn't understand the  technology.  Well, the judge has a number of clerks that may understand the  technology.  </p><p>These Senators and congress people have a number of aides that may  understand the technology.  So that's part of this, too.</p><p>JAIN:  Anyway -- I do think that at the end of the day Facebook is open to  regulation.  So is Google, so is Apple.  So everybody wants to move this  floor in a productive way.  It's just a matter of doing it in the right  process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well said but I would like them to cut the let's all join hands.   It's the summer love mantra coming out of Facebook.</p><p>Breaking news -- President Trump has tweeted this, moments ago on Syria,  \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready,  Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  You shouldn't  be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.\"   Strong words from President Trump.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we're going to speak with House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling; House Judiciary Committee  member Congressman Ted Poe; former Republican presidential candidate Herman  Cain will be here; and Dr. Mikhail Varshavski -- Dr. Mike.</p><p>But right here, right now we have the judge standing by to talk about one  of our top stories this morning.  We were talking about Facebook and the  testimony from Zuckerberg yesterday.  But let's talk about Facebook's role  in the Russia meddling probe. </p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed during that testimony that the tech titan is  working with Special counsel Robert Mueller.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I assume Facebook has been served with subpoenas from  special counsel Mueller's office.  Is that correct?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the  special counsel's office?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you been interviewed?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  Let me clarify that.  I actually am not aware of  a subpoena.  I believe that there may be.  But I know we're working with  them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me right now Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- just your thoughts.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well, sometimes  when the government wants information it breaks down doors like it did to  the doors of the Trump Organization at 5:30 in the morning to get to  Michael Cohen's records on the inside.  And sometimes it just says Mr.  Zuckerberg, can we speak to your people?  No search warrant, no FBI agents,  no guns drawn, no subpoena.</p><p>So I would imagine that they used a softer approach with Mr. Zuckerberg's  people than they did with Michael Cohen.  Meaning they sent some FBI agents  there to engage in what appeared to be friendly conversations about how --  tell us how you know who is placing these ads.  Are these Russians?  Are  these people who are pretending to be Americans?</p><p>Give us the technology.  Talk us through it.  And they probably willingly  did and he might be personally unfamiliar -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with the conversation.  He may think it's pursuant to a  subpoena.  My guess is it is probably just a friendly request.  The  government comes knocking and they ask you to talk to them, you can say  yes, you can say no.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But my reaction to that was I wonder if people will be upset  that without a subpoena that Facebook potentially hands over or reveals  private information that's on the network because I just go back to Apple.   And Apple fighting tooth and nail in the court system to avoid rewriting an  operating system to allow the FBI in to look at the San Bernardino killer's  phone.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My buddies at the FBI were not happy with me but I cheered  Apple on, they did the exact right thing for their customers.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- and I realize now why Apple did it.  I realize  now because now Tim Cook has two strong legs to stand on -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in terms of protecting people's privacy.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  Now, we don't know -- Senator Leahy in my view asked  the right questions.  He could have gone deeper but I don't know that Mark  Zuckerberg would have known the answer.  We don't know exactly what  information Bob Mueller's people, FBI agents, got from the Facebook team --  whether they got personal private information.</p><p>Theoretically, theoretically, if Facebook received a subpoena for Dagen  McDowell's account they would notify you to give you and your lawyers the  opportunity to negotiate the subpoena or to ask a judge to quash it.  I say  theoretically.  That doesn't always work that way.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And it didn't -- I mean it's not -- I mean it's not apples to  apples on the comparison but id didn't work that way in the Cambridge  Analytica case, right.  And that's where it got brought up a little bit  yesterday and that's why -- I think that's sort of at the heart of this  matter is what are we as users of Facebook -- there's so much focus  yesterday on how they use their data for advertising.  That's their  business model -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  -- but what are we as users of Facebook have a right to know.  So  if there's a breach of my data, somebody gets my credit card information,  that day the bank's telling me, hey they got your credit card, you need to  get a new card.</p><p>Whereas in the Cambridge Analytica case, they took forever to call.  They  didn't tell anybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out something real quick.  This is beyond - - to understand what Facebook was doing -- from 2007 until 2015, it's not  about Cambridge Analytica.  It's about your information being accessed by a  friends' app -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And no one knew -- no one knew that any app developer was  accessing your information.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Fully agreed -- fully agreed and you know, we are talking  about a private entity here that has agreements with the Federal Trade  Commission to inform Connell if for example there was a breach of your  account and the failure to do that result in a fine, sounds small, but do  the math of $40,000 per breach.   </p><p>JAIN:  You had 87 million breaches -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  Do the math, 710 that is a huge number even for  Zuckerberg.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, that consent decree was put in place two years  before they actually ended the practice of letting all the app developers  access the information from not only the app users but the friends of the  app users.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  All right.  Can I talk to you about delicious irony?  These  senators ranting and raving about Facebook violating privacy, what is the  greatest violator of personal privacy on the planet?  The federal  government.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTIGATION STRATEGIST, CFRA:  The government.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government that they run and that they fund and that they  authorize.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>JAIN:  No, we were just -- we were just saying that.  I mean the amount of  data -- what data does the federal government not have access to anyway  they are looking for from Facebook for this particular case.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that there is an answer to that question.  They  can get everything.</p><p>JAIN:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They know everywhere I go when this is with me, every  conversation I had, even when you and I talk in the greenroom, every e-mail  that I send and every text that I send.  It's not just me.  It's all of us.</p><p>JAIN:  Everyone is worried about Facebook listening to your microphone but  the Feds actually have the ability to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  The judge is worked up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge, not that that helps.</p><p>But the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke about  Mueller's investigation yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein oversees the special counsel and only  he has the power to fire the special counsel.  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, we've been  advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  these comments of course, after the FBI raided the office, the  home and the hotel room of longtime personal attorney to President Trump,  Michael Cohen.  That raid has raising questions about attorney-client  privilege.  What about firing Mueller in that as well?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Ok.  Let's start with firing Mueller.  There are areas of the  law that are very clear.  Go 30 miles an hour in front of the Fox Building,  you get a ticket because the speed limit is 25.  There's really no dispute.   The cops have discretion if you're doing 25 and 30.</p><p>Can the President of the United States fire a special counsel?  The law is  unclear.  There is a federal regulation that governs the Justice Department  that says specifically only the appointing authority, in this case Rod  Rosenstein, can fire the special counsel and it has got to be for cause.</p><p>There is other authority that says the President runs the executive branch  of the government and he can fire whoever he wants for any sound reason, a  person in the executive branch that's not protected by civil service.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President could rescind that law that gives Rosenstein the  authority to fire him, could he?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No.  Only Congress can.  It is in the CFR.  It's easy for  Congress to do that, the Code of Federal Regulations but it would require  Congress to do that.  That law comes about -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JAIN:  -- the investigation. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has never been tested before.  But when Richard Nixon had  Professor Archibald Cox fired, he directed his attorney general to do it,  the attorney general resigned.  He directed the number two person at DOJ to  do it.  That person resigned.  He directed the number three person to do  it, Bob Bork of notoriety later on in life.  He fired the special counsel  and was replaced by another special counsel as we know undid the President.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we should also point out that it was revealed last week the  Mueller probe, they don't view President Trump as a criminal target.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They view him as a subject.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A subject but not -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You could go from subject to target -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It could change.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- like that.  </p><p>Now here is what is interesting -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- if I could between the lines, in the weeds, whatever phrase  you want to use about what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday.  They did  research.  They dispatched lawyers to give them a legal opinion, the White  House as to whether or not the President of the United States on his own  bypassing the AG, bypassing the deputy attorney general could single- handedly fire Bob Mueller and their research told them yes.</p><p>Why did they do that research?  It remains to be seen.  </p><p>BELL:  Wouldn't he rather prefer to fire Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would that look better.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and was confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>He can fire Rod Rosenstein just like he could fire any cabinet officer.   Politically it would be damaging but legally he could do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You better show me how to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to make you laugh before you went. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure -- guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Such a pleasure, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Fox Business Network will bring you Zuckerberg's testimony live at 10:00  a.m.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news -- a plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  We're just getting some new  numbers then -- Dagen.  Good morning.</p><p>An Algerian military jet has crashed near the country's capital killing at  least 257 people.  The plane came down near a military base shortly after  it took off.  Authorities there say some survivors have been rescued.  It  is not clear what caused this crash but it's the worst plane crash in  Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet went down killing 102 people.</p><p>Well, let's head back home to south Florida, that state hit by two  tornadoes.  The National Weather Service says the first one struck downtown  Fort Lauderdale yesterday afternoon packing winds of up to 65 miles an hour  -- look at that.  The twister knocked out power, thousands delayed hundreds  of flights out of the airport there.</p><p>The second tornado touched down near Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Airport  about an hour later with winds topping out at 84 miles an hour.  One of the  runways was closed for more than two hours while crews picked up all of the  debris.  Look at those crushed metal.</p><p>Well, Chevrolet is stepping up its challenge to Ford, showing off its next- generation Silverado and it is enormous.  2020 Silverado HD is going to  built in Flint, Michigan.  It's going to roll off the production line in  the third quarter of 2019.  Ford has dominated the pickup truck segment and  Chevy is hoping hopes to close the gap with three new Silverado's.  Shares  of General Motors are down 7 percent so far this year.</p><p>Ok.  Chick-Fil-A has won top-rankings of food quality and customer service.   Now, it looks like they've won over teenagers.  And a survey of teens from  Piper Jaffray, Chick-Fil-A beat out chains including, get this, Starbucks,  Chipotle, even McDonald's.  Chick-Fil-A has an established following in the  south.  Now, the chain is gaining fans in places like New York City because  it's right down that street, and the Midwest.  In 2017 Chick-Fil-A reported  one of the $9 billion in revenue up more than a billion from 2016.  And by  2020 Chick-Fil-A is expected by some analysts to be the third largest  restaurant chain in the United States by sales anyway -- Dagen.</p><p>And true story, when I was in high school I worked at Chick-Fil-A.  Yes, at  the mall in Phoenix, Arizona and then they found out that I was lying about  my age and they fired me.  But it was a fun couple of weeks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, people love Chick-Fil-A because the people who  operate the franchises and the people who work there are nice. </p><p>CASONE:  They're nice.  Yes.  The food is good.  Chicken is good.  Like I  said, down the street.  I know you won't go there but I might -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a giant one down at the Fulton Street Market -- </p><p>CASONE:  New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the biggest in the country, by the way.  </p><p>CASONE:  New Yorkers love it, man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, New Yorkers do like nice people.  </p><p>Coming up easing tensions over tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping  sparking a rally yesterday with comments on the opening up about the  economy.  We'll look at the chances that we avoid trade war.</p><p>And a whole new meaning to watching the scales -- why doctors are warning  the snake diet is going viral.  You don't eat snakes -- we will explain  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The art of trade war -- U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers going head to head.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" U.S.  trade official are laying blame on Chinese metal firms for rerouting goods  to other countries like Vietnam in order to skirt tariffs.  This coming  after Chinese President Xi Jinping said that he would open markets and ease  some import tariffs yesterday.</p><p>Futures are looking like this, this morning.  We ought to point out that  the futures took a turn even lower with a 268-point loss on the Dow futures  right now right after President Trump sent out that tweet on Syria about  Russia.</p><p>So I want to point out that that is why you are seeing the selling pick up  steam as we move a little bit more than two hours away from the opening  bell.</p><p>Joining me now is Payden &amp; Rygel chief economist Jeffrey Cleveland -- what  to make of the trade issue.  That seems to have been rocking markets  lately.  But this all started -- the volatility came back with a vengeance  in early February because of concerns about inflation and higher interests  rates.  So what is it?  </p><p>JEFFREY CLEVELAND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PAYDEN AND RYGEL:  Well, I think the  trade story is like so many narratives in the market, you know, people get  really attached to them it becomes -- it dominates headlines and then it  goes away because we make too much of it.</p><p>That is how I remember last year and the Fed's balance sheet story,  remember how the Fed was going to shrink its balance sheet and that it was  going to be a big deal.  That didn't happen.</p><p>Before that, you know, you had things like the fiscal cliff.  So I think  that is what, for me, the trade story is.  It doesn't change our overall  growth outlook.  </p><p>BELL:  But is that true though because you are immediately seeing impact to  steel prices, pork prices, soybean prices. So that is impacting the farmers  in the Midwest. But then when does it creep into sentiment numbers for the  consumer for businesses.  I know small business sentiment was at a new high  in the most recent reading.  So I feel like once it creeps into those  numbers you could really start to see an economic impact.  </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I think you're exactly right.  If you look at -- you do  have market moves.  You have volatility.  The question is does that feed  into the actual economic data.  The earliest read of that I think would be  a small business survey which has come off a little from the highs but it's  still very elevated.</p><p>So I don't think the market volatility has bled through into the economic  outlook.  And I think the story really is going back to the inflation  story.  I mean we had that shock early February with the jobs report, the  average hourly earnings number.  I think that's set off a re-pricing in the  bond market which bled through into equities.</p><p>So it's really for me the inflation story that's driving everything here,  and I think today -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  We get the CPI today.  The core is expected to be 2.1 percent  by Bloomberg's latest survey.  That's the first time, it is ever 2 percent  in a handful of months at least.  I'm not exactly sure what's your take on  that if we get that more than 2 percent number.  </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I mean I don't want to make too much of it.  This is not  the 1970s.  This is stagflation or anything like that.  I do think 2.1  percent -- that 2 percent is a real critical threshold for the bond market  because the 2 percent is the number that the Fed is targeting.  So if, you  know, the bond market has been complacent for months because inflation was  low, it was sub 2 percent, you suddenly get above 2 percent, just  psychologically, I think that changes the game.</p><p>And then people start looking around.  You know, how it works, looking  around they start seeing inflation everywhere.  So they're going to start  seeing it in the aluminum prices, in oil prices.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they're going to see it at the pump this summer.</p><p>CLEVELAND:  Exactly -- gasoline prices.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that changes sentiment because again, that's one inflation  gauge that people relate to from East Coast to West Coast.  </p><p>BELL:  It's the consumers wall -- Jamie Dimon has been really warning about  the potential for higher inflation going forward too, to this.  Maybe it  could be just the beginning.</p><p>We are getting into earnings season and a lot of the bulls are hanging  their hat on earnings really being what is going to calm this market.  Do  you believe that we'll get a look at the fundamentals?</p><p>CLEVELAND:  You know, I think near-term I do worry that the inflation story  will surprise the market.  We will get another repricing in interest rates  that will have a knock-on effect on the equity market.  So there's a short  term.  So that's -- I think over the next three months, let's say.</p><p>Longer-term, what I'm worried about is -- and what I'm going to focus on is  do we continue to see the unemployment rate fall?  If the unemployment rate  falls below 4 percent I think that is good for the consumer, I think that's  good for earnings.  </p><p>So it's really that story that I think over the, you know, the six to 12  month timeframe that will be more important.  And I think that will happen.   I think the unemployment rate falls below 4 percent in the next few months.   And that's fantastic.</p><p>We have only been that low on the unemployment rate three times in the  post-war era -- late 60s, late 90s for a few months, and the late 50s.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jeffrey -- good to see you.  Jeffrey Cleveland -- </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Payden and Rygel.  Take care -- </p><p>CLEVELAND:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and we will be watching again.  CPI out about a little more  than an hour from now.</p><p>Still ahead the immigration debate heating up -- why another California  town is joining the fight against sanctuary cities.</p><p>And the sky is the limit for the new airbus planes -- the wild features in  store for flyers, beds in the cargo hold.

Your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure amid rising tensions with Syria.  President Trump warning  earlier this hour that missiles will be coming.  And you are seeing those  concerns show up in the stock market in the Futures.  We have a 257 point  loss on the Dow Futures.

The investors are also  waiting on inflation data, consumer prices, and the minutes from the  Federal Reserve latest meeting, You'll going to get that this afternoon.

The Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike against the Assad regime.  But now Futures are extending  losses after President Trump's tweet earlier.  Here's what the President  said on Twitter.  'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia because they will be coming.  Nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.'  This coming after Moscow voted against a U.N.  resolution yesterday to investigate Saturday's suspected chemical attack  that killed dozens of people in Syria.  Joining me now is the member of the  House Committees on Judiciary and Foreign Affairs, Texas Congressman Ted  Poe.  Congressman Poe, your reactions to very strong words from the  President.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  Well, the President wants the Russians and really  the Syrians to know now where we stand on this issue.  Chemical weapons,  the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law.  The  Russians and the Syrians agreed a year or two ago to get rid of all of the  chemical weapons out of Syria.  They lied.  They're still there and they're  being used against the people of Syria.  There has to be consequences for  this violation of international law and the President is going to have a --  I suspect a targeted strike into Syria in retaliation for the use of  chemical weapons.  There are many options that's are available down the  road, most of them are not very good and the fact that I don't think most  Americans want a full military invasion of Syria.  I don't think that's  going to happen.  Targeted strike to get their attention is something that  I think the President's going to do and I support him in that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.  So, to your point, if the tweet is a directive, we are going  down the road of military action against Syria, there's almost no doubt  about it after the President's comments, Congressman this morning.  So  targeted strike to get their attention, once you have it, then what?   What's the goal?  </p><p>POE:  Well, the goal is to immediately have them quit using chemical  weapons.  Now, that has not worked in the past.  They went ahead and used  chemical weapons anyway.  So, there has to be some retaliation to the  Syrians and to the Russians and don't forget the Iranians.  The Iranians  are involved in all of this too, who've murdered their own people.  And  what that will be, I hope is something that will cease and desist on the  use of chemical weapons in the Civil War in Syria.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how big is the --</p><p>POE:  The United States is not going -- the United States is not going to  topple the regime, remove Assad.  That's not going to happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Despite the air -- the strike on that air base, that airfield  last year, there's a lot that the United States has not done to really go  after Bashar al-Assad.  I'll point to a chlorine gas attack earlier this  year, killed more than 20 people, mostly children and that warranted what  was essentially a statement from Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state,  that was saying that it was no denying that Russia by shielding its Syrian  ally has breached its commitment to the United States as a framework  guarantor, this is about the U.N. deal some years ago brokered by the Obama  administration.  </p><p>But again, we didn't strike.  And Bashar al-Assad read that as quite  frankly, weakness and that he would pay no price.  We've also did not stop  Iran from establishing a new military presence on the border with Israel in  Syria.  So, how big does this message need to be?  Do we need to take out  the entire air force of Bashar al-Assad?  </p><p>POE:  What we do really, I think is something that the military and the  President need to decide.  But it has to be strong enough to keep the  Russians, the Iranians and the Syrians from using chemical weapons on their  own people.  And that it has to be the message that we send to them.  Assad  is I think going to stay in power.  It's not our plan to remove him.  I do  not see the United States using a full military invasion of Syria, but I  think a strike will be strong enough to say look, you have to cease and  desist.  The Russians and the Iranians and the Syrians, they cannot be  trusted.  They are using this as a proxy war to really influence, have  their own Russian and Iranian influence in Syria with Assad as their  puppet.  But that needs to be strong.  And I think it will be strong when  the President decides what exactly to do in military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now, do they heat the sanctuary show down, another  California City voting overnight to join the Justice Department law suit.   Challenging the so-called sanctuary state law.  Watch as residents in  Orange County take a bold stance against the policy limiting cooperation  between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT:  Anybody for (INAUDIBLE) doesn't realize we're  talking about criminals here, not refugees, not immigrants, criminals.   We're going to deport them and that's just too bad if you don't like it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Members of the National Guard in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas  have already begun arriving at the southern border.  The California has not  yet complied with President Trump's request.  Congressman, your thoughts on  this? </p><p>POE:  It's a smart move on the part of the President to put the National  Guard on the border.  I'm from Texas.  And we had the National Guard down  there a few years ago.  And it worked.  It stopped people from crossing  into the United States.  So, I totally support that idea because it's  something that has worked in the past.  Now, one thing that we need to do  as a nation is remember, we have to protect the border and the border is  the middle of the Rio Grande River.  </p><p>And once people cross that middle and come into the United States, they're  already in the United States.  So, our philosophy needs to be keep people  from crossing.  Therefore, we need boats in the water, down the middle of  the Rio Grande River and we also need the aerostats, cameras and those kind  of things to prevent people from crossing in the first place.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  We are showing a graphic that says border  apprehensions in March did surge, up more than 200 percent year over year  but they had been dramatically falling since the year 2000, in fact.  I  believe last year they were at the lowest level since 1971.  So, the action  by this administration is in response to those apprehensions going up in  recent months.  I want to get your reaction, Congressman, President Trump  is quite busy this morning, just tweeting this about Russia.  \"Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been.  And that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together.  Stop the arms race.\"  </p><p>Congressman, your reaction to that?  Because again, this President more  than any other has been attacked by people on the left, people in the media  for being light on Russia, again pushing that narrative of collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia and his actions and words have both  been incredibly strong at laying down what he feels about Russia, Russia  interference and Russian aggression.  </p><p>POE:  Well, there are people in the media who are obsessed with hating on  Trump and they will use anything they can to do so.  And Russia is one of  the examples.  Look at the big picture.  The President has been tough on  Russia and he's going to continue to be tough on Russia because Russia is a  bully.  They lie about their foreign policy.  They have invaded crime  media, they have invaded Eastern Ukraine, they have invaded Georgia with no  consequences.  And they're going to continue.  </p><p>I think Putin is going to continue when he finds an opportunity to move  into somebody else's country and try to put troops there.  The President of  the United States recognizes that, and we need to -- and he sees the  importance of making sure that Russia is not an aggressor nation like it  wants to be.  In his talk is tough and also his actions are tough of  removing spies from the United States, sending them back home where they  belong.  And I think it is a new day in the relationship with Russia is  that we need to get tough on Russia.  But Russia needs to work with the  west and they refuse to do so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think, one thing that did not get enough attention were  the sanctions on Putin's rich cronies and their ability to do business  sanctions on their assets, lending their ability to do business.  That hits  somewhere it hurts and ultimately that might change Putin's behavior.  But  again, not much coverage of what the Treasury Department did last week.   Congressman, it's good to see you.  Congressman Poe from Texas.  Take care.  </p><p>POE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a cheap repair could cost you in the long run.  Why  iPhone owners may want to think twice before using a third party to fix a  broken screen.  And Hollywood taking Toronto, the unexpected choice set to  play controversial ex-mayor Rob Ford in an upcoming movie.  He looks more  like Connell McShane.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a hint.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets under pressure this morning amid rising tensions with  Russia and Syria.  The President Trump has been tweeting this hour about  this relationship and about Syria and here's what he had to say.  'Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together to stop the arms race.'  Earlier this  hour he said 'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  </p><p>Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming.  Nice and new and, \"smart\".   You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.'  What has been the reaction in the markets?  Futures  are lower, 230-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, but loss is kind of  equal losses on all three major market gauges in the Futures market so far  this morning.  And that selling is picking up steam because of those  tweets.  Meantime, Apple loses a major patent infringement case.  Cheryl  Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes Dagen, another stock to watch today as  well.  Shares of VirnetX surging since the Federal Jury in Texas said that  Apple must pay that security software company $500 million over infringed  patents.  And the Jury ruled that Apple's FaceTime, its VPN and its Demand  on iMessage features infringe four of VirnetX patents.  The imagers based  on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices.  This is a big one.   Meanwhile, there is more iPhone problems to tell you about.  A new update  disables iPhone eight devices that have screens that were at some point  repaired by a third party.  The update renders the touch screen useless.   The only option, you have to replace the screen again and Apple has to do  it.  A similar problem happened with the iPhone seven.  That was fixed,  though.  Anyway, another stock to watch going to be Apple today.  It's  slightly lower in the premarket.  </p><p>OK, here's something for you.  Especially if you fly a lot, Airbus may have  come up with the next big thing in travel on long range flights.  Bunk beds  in the cargo hold.  You're looking at the rendering of this idea.  They  plan to include this on the A330 and A350 jets by 2020.  Airbus is also  looking at offering a children's play area, complete with a playground, a  slide, and even hospital rooms on-board.  Passengers (INAUDIBLE) passengers  would have to be buckled in and seated during take-off and landing.  Shares  of Airbus are up more than 15 percent.  I said this on \"FBN:AM\" this  morning Dagen (INAUDIBLE) the story that basically, I don't know, they'll  put the play room and the beds side-by-side.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't play in the streets.  Play in a \"sleeping berth\" which  they haven't cleaned for the last 80 flights (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>CASONE:  I'm hoping they clean them.  I'm hoping they clean them.  OK  really quick one more.  Billion-star Damian Lewis reportedly set to play  Toronto's controversial former mayor Rob Ford in a new movie.  Hollywood  reporter is saying that the 47-year-old British actor has been cast to play  the mayor.  The movie is going to be called \"Run This Town\".  Remember Ford  died from cancer back in 2016.  But he made international headlines 2013  when a cell phone video showed him smoking crack cocaine.  Dagen, here's  the thing, Damian Lewis is a really small guy, I mean, he's a slight guy,  he's a good-looking guy but he's a thin man.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We call him \"Billions\", he was on \"Homeland\".  I was trying to  say that the guy cast to play Rob Ford looks more like Connell than Rob  Ford.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, I was wondering about that.  I was wondering who's it going  to be actually.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the tease.</p><p>MCSHANE: (INAUDIBLE) it could be a lot worse speaking Dagen's past  pronounced. With it could be a lot worse. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and I -- He's a fine actor.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  He is a good actor.  He's a very good actor.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can he play Rob Ford?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I don't know if anyone can play Rob Ford.  We miss -- we miss old  Rob Ford.  He was -- he was an original.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know who could play Rob Ford?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Who?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris Farley.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, it's not going to happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, may he rest in peace.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's not going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have to get you to watch \"Billions\".</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I love \"Billions\".  I got to get you to watch  \"Billions\".</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I do, it's on my list.</p><p>JAIN:  Catch up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On Showtime.  We'll be right back, everybody.  Coming up next,  shedding your winter skin, the health issues behind the viral new trend  dubbed Snake Diet.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Favorite story of the day.  Can eating like a snake help you  lose weight?  There is a new fad diet called the Snake Diet.  Participants  drink nothing but apple cider vinegar with mineral replacements for two  days and then go on a flexible fasting routine.  The diet founder claims  say it is similar to how snakes eat.  The critics of the diet claim it is  dangerous and will not produce long-term results.  Joining me now is Doctor  Mikhail Varshavski.  Better known as Doctor Mike.  Tell us what you think  about this.  </p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, FAMILY MEDICINE:  I will say this, at the  outset right away, this is not a healthy diet.  This is not going to give  you any kind of results.  It's probably going to be dangerous for your  health and the person who created this diet, his name is Cole Robinson,  actually has a video on Youtube where he talks about it.  It's borderline  psychopath behavior.  He's calling people fatties.  He's screaming about  how you're supposed to eat like a snake and it's in our nature.  He makes  wild claims that it's going to cure type two diabetes, inflammation,  herpes.  </p><p>None of this is substantiated by science.  And I'm so passionate about  this, I just gave it, had talked about six months ago on this type of  experts.  They're IKA experts, I know all.  They think they understand  everything there is to know about science research and doctors don't know  what they're doing.  When in reality what they do is they take fringe  scientific research, weak scientific research, combine it and pull it  together and think that they've created the next new magical fact.  And  this is an example of it, the Snake Diet which is just complete, complete  garbage.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I call it, you know, it's not attention seeking behavior, I call  them attention seeking dolts, ASD.  But by the way, let me just clear  something up.  Because I, I'm a reptile freak.  A snake, like a six-foot  diamond carpet python eats once every two weeks, it drinks water and it  will eat one medium size rat.  It should be dead and frozen and then  thawed.  Otherwise the rat might bite the snake.  But it eats one rat every  two weeks. </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, that's not a diet for anybody but --  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Look, this gentleman basically claims that prolonged fasting  will help you lose weight.  Yes, eating less will help you lose weight.   But you don't need to do it so drastically.  Because number one, you won't  stick with such a crazy, strict diet.  People who have comorbidities or  other illnesses like diabetes or heart failure if they follow his dry  fasting or salt water fasting routine.  They'll overload the fluid --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's the problem, no, here's the problem, if you starve me and  tell me to fast, I'm not going to act like a snake.  I will turn into a  fire-breathing dragon.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's kind of weird.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what, I'm sitting -- I get really irritable.  Hungry.   Hungry.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You got to hold and knock this guy?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Tell me one snake you know that has herpes.  I have to be honest  with you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I can't argue that.  I can't argue that as a doctor.  I don't  know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what?  Snakes do get mites.  They're specific to  snakes, snake mite.  And they're very hard to get rid of.  Dr. Mike, love  you.  It's always great to see you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you so much, appreciate it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like it when you get upset because you're cool about it.   Ankur Jain you have to come back.  Good to see you my friend.</p><p>JAIN:  Great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman Cain is up next hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p>You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.

Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p>CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p>CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p>BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p>BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p>I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p>There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p>The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p>That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p>CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p>Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p>And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p>CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p>BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p>CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p>CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p>CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p>CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p>CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p>CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p>CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p>The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p>CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p>CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p>And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p>Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p>And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p>REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p>SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p>CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p>MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p>CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p>So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p>So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p>And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p>I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p>CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p>CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p>CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p>CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not in the least.  But he got a big job done,  the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the  board of?  No, I don't think so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all over my head.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office?  We'll be right  back, everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks all, Herman Cain.  Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I shall.  Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.  The  President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  April 11th.  Your top stories at 6a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Stocks surging, the Dow climbing more than 400 points yesterday after  China's President Xi Jinping promised an open market and to cut tariffs on  auto imports.  Futures are showing this, 400 plus point gain on the Dow  Futures on the Dow yesterday.  Ninety point loss on the Dow Futures today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe, stocks there mostly lower.  Across the board losses in England,  France, and Germany, although slight.  And it was mixed reaction in Asia  overnight with gains in Shanghai and on the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> One of the top winners yesterday, Facebook shares seeing their biggest gain  in two years, up about four and a half percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg did  an admirable job facing a grilling on Capitol Hill from people who clearly  didn't understand Facebook, some of them.  He was grilled on everything,  from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian election interference, you  name it, he was asked it, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens  here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What Mark Zuckerberg's testimony could mean for future  regulation in the tech sector, that's ahead.  He's back on Capitol Hill at  10:00a.m. this morning.  </p><p> Nunes fighting back, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee set  to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director  Christopher Wray as the Justice Department still refuses to provide him  with an unredacted document showing the justification for their Russia  probe.  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol, that's ahead.</p><p>Bank of America changing its stance on firearms.  The bank says it will no  longer lend money to companies that make so-called assault rifles for  civilians.  </p><p> Plus, never give up on your dreams, after spending 10 years in the  development league, on basketball player delivers a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  The incredible story coming up.</p><p> And one small step for man, one giant leap online, NASA helping you channel  your inner Neil Armstrong with a brand new virtual tour of the moon.</p><p> All of that coming up and so much more this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  FOX Business's Connell McShane.  And Kairos  Founder, Ankur Jain.  Ankur, just really quickly, what was your take on  Zuckerberg yesterday?</p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I'm going to tell you, Mark did a great job.   I mean, all things considered.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love how you refer to him by his first name.</p><p> JAIN:  But I mean look, I got to tell you, the good thing was I think that  Zuckerberg did a great job for Facebook.  I think the challenge that the  congressmen had no idea what to ask to actually address the problem, and  that's a challenge.  This is an important topic.  And if you're going to  have the Senate sitting there taking the time to figure out what  regulations technology need, they need to know the right questions asked.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, right.  We have another episode of old  people talking technology at 10:00 this morning, right?  They had no idea  how to follow-up was the main point.  </p><p> JAIN:  I mean, honestly some of other was just a lack of understanding what  Facebook is.  Somebody -- I forget which one of the congressman held up a  poster board of five Facebook groups and goes, \"Mr. Zuckerberg, are you --  can you authenticate that these were not owned by Russian trolls?\"</p><p> If I were him, I would have been like, \"There are three billion groups.  I  don't remember every single group.\"  I mean, it's just --</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> JAIN:  It's just a shame.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He was prepped.  He bought the kind of legal prep that billions  of dollars can buy, put it that way.  And he followed the script that was  handed to him, we'll get into that.  That's what we're talking about, the  top of the show.  </p><p> And coming up this morning, Texas Congressman, House Financial Services  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Texas Congressman Ted Poe.  Former  Presidential Candidate Herman Cain.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  And Dr. Mike, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski on the snake diet,  yes, that's one of our things that we'll be discussing with Dr. Mike.</p><p> But to our top story this hour, Mark Zuckerberg squaring off with lawmakers  on Capitol Hill, the Facebook CEO testifying for about five hours before  skeptical senators who demanded answers on how the social media company  allowed Cambridge Analytica to misuse the personal data up to 87 million  Facebook users.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. DICK DUBIN (D), ILLINIOS, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel  you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> DUBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p> DUBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, (INAUDIBLE) in modern  America, \"connecting people around the world.\"</p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:   Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today and I say this  gently, your user agreement sucks.  You can spot me 75 IQ points, if I can  figure that, you can figure that.  The purpose of that user agreement is to  cover Facebook's rear-end, it's not to inform your users about their  rights. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investors did react positively to Zuckerberg's performance.   Shares of the social media company were up four and a half percent.  Mark  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning.  He is set to testify  before House lawmakers.</p><p> Joining us now, Gabelli Multimedia Trust Portfolio Manager, Larry Haverty.   Larry, my takeaway if -- looking at it from a market perspective and in an  investor perspective is, even without additional regulations which might be  coming, Facebook's going to be spending a lot more money on security, on  policing the content on that social media platform.  Is that fully factored  into the stock, their increase in expenses?</p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST:  Well I think  that's the $64,000 question here.  There are two context that I think this  discussion needs to be framed in.  </p><p> The first is the emotional context and that was the theater that the  Congressional grilling provided for viewers yesterday.  Five hours is an  awfully long time and I think Mark did very, very well on that.  I'd give  him an A- grade.  I thought the best answer was the hotel one and I think - - I thought he gave the wrong answer when I heard it but then I thought  maybe it was the right answer because he does need to maintain his personal  security and frankly, it isn't anyone's real business where he stays.</p><p> The second question remains answer -- unanswered though and that's the  financial question.  And you look at what Facebook's doing, they've said  they're going to add 5,000 people, that's a good crowd for a small college  basketball game.  Those people are going to need facilities, I think that's  at least a $1 billion cost, that raises the cost based on Facebook by a  very significant amount.</p><p> Now, this is a company with very, very strong margins.  My guess is that  the margins are going to go down at least 500 points but I think we have to  wait two weeks to more or less figure this out when Facebook reports its  first quarter and I'm pretty sure if the people gave Zuckerberg the advice  they did and he performed as well as he did, the crisis managers are going  to tell them how to handle the earnings release which I think is to be  upfront with the cost on this as much as possible and I think that's not a  hundred percent, they're not going to know until probably a year later how  much they spent.</p><p> They'll clearly be a significant one-time charge but with $41 billion,  that's not a big deal.  Net-net, the stock had been in my opinion, if  nothing went wrong and clearly that's no longer the case.  The stock had  been priced very cheaply relative to its growth and I think it can handle  this once the computers that are trained especially in technology  investments to detest the margin contraction get few -- get through with  selling the stock the minute the numbers come out because I think there  will be margin pressure greater than people expect and I think once the  numbers come out, the first trade will be down on the stock in a couple  weeks.  So --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, what was your take yesterday on what happened?</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Well I think the stock  was up because this could have been just a relief rally or maybe it was a  short selling -- a short squeeze, excuse me.</p><p> Larry, I'd love to get your take though, when I think about Facebook, I  wonder about the future of this company because you have Mark Zuckerberg  out there talking to the press saying and -- to senators saying that,  \"Look, we are kind of like a media company, you are seeing expense going  up, you're going to see margin compression.\"  Trading at 22 times, yes,  that's a huge discount to its historical average but it's still premium to  media companies.  Where is this company going to evolve to?  You've got  Sheryl and Mark talking about paid subscription services, what is the  future of Facebook and what's the right valuation to value that?</p><p> HAVERTY:  Oh, I think the secret sauce here is very important and that's  the first thing I learned about this company and mercifully I learned it  before it went public from talking with some people who did business with  the company.  </p><p> The advertising works and it's very unique.  You have David Ogilvy, one of  the advertising gurus historically 50 percent of advertising works, I just  don't know which 50 percent.  Facebook can prove its efficacy, it's more  efficient than alternatives.  So advertisers, unless there are real, real  major problems are going to embrace it.  They're not going to walk away.  A  few may walk away, my guess is maybe you lose two to three percent on add  volume, you're clearly going to have cautious CPM pricing for the next 12  months and then I think the systems will write themselves but this company  has a tremendous comparative advantage versus comp.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  CPM being called for million (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HAVERTY:  Tremendous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cost for thousand views (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HAVERTY:  Yes, cost for thousand.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get your take on what you heard about regulation from  these senators yesterday because it's not going to be just Facebook.  As an  entrepreneur, are you worried about Washington getting in the way of  innovation and creation?</p><p> JAIN:  So I think -- look, let's break it out.  One, Zuck said himself that  Facebook is open to the right kind of regulation.  I think secondly, it's  really not the Facebook problem, right?  I mean, Google has as much or more  data on users than Facebook does.</p><p> The question is, what's the right kind of regulation?  After watching the  Congress yesterday ask their questions, I worry that if they're left to  create regulation it will do things that stifle innovation and actually  block the services that actual people --</p><p> MCSHANE:  We never got to that question about what the -- I mean, maybe we  did.  I mean, to the entire -- to whatever else, five or six hours but what  I saw, it never got to your question which is what is the right type of  regulation.  </p><p> I think Kamala Harris, the senator from California maybe came closest and  she tried to press him, I think it was in the 6:00 hour Eastern Time  talking about Cambridge Analytica data breach.  It's like, why didn't you  tell the users about that?  He's like, \"We know that they are taking our  data, we know they're using it for advertising to make it more targeted.\"   But once there's a breach, why weren't the users told about that and what  type of regulation can help prevent that in the future?  And he dodged.</p><p> JAIN:  I think the common theme you saw throughout Zuck's testimony was  transparency.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> JAIN:  And I think that is ultimately where the right regulation goes, is  that as long as these companies are transparent about what they're doing  with data, what's happening with the data, I think at that point, the  user's decisions on how much they want to give Facebook, how much they want  to use Facebook, et cetera.  And so, hopefully the Congress will lean  towards that kind of regulation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I will end on this note, one, Sheryl Sandberg needs the same  kind of grilling from the legal team that Mark Zuckerberg does because,  again, her kind of like flip hair-toss reaction to what's been going on at  Facebook for the last decade is a little dismissive to investors and two,  what was ironic was listening to those senators asks Mark Zuckerberg those  questions was the equivalent of watching my 82-year-old father try to use  Facebook.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That he was like -- it was the equivalent of like flicking the  phone like there's a bug on it and then dimming the screen to the point  that he throws the phone at you and tells you he -- that Facebook broke his  phone, that's what it felt like.</p><p> JAIN:  If Facebook does have access to people's car records, I'd love for  them to release how many Congressmen called their grandkids that morning  and say, \"Can you please quickly walk me through Facebook before I  interview this Mark guy.\"  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  It's embarrassing.  A bunch of times it's embarrassing.  It  was -- I mean, it's almost like when we do an interview with someone, you - - a lot of times you know the subject, you're ready to follow-up like this.   But if you're not -- if you don't know the topic, you can ask the first  question, forget about the follow-ups and that was -- what happened a ton  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But fear the wiley southerner because I think Lindsey Graham  acted all folksy and very foghorn leghorn but then he backed Mark into  trying to basically asking him if you have a monopoly.  And so I thought  that he used -- he was like, \"Go ahead, assume that I'm stupid because I'm  from the south\" and then he went in for the kill shot.</p><p> JAIN:  It was definitely smart at some point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you Ankur.  Larry, it was great to have you here,  terrific analysis as always, please come back very, very soon Larry  Haverty.</p><p> HAVERTY:  Thanks a lot.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And keep it here on FOX Business for live coverage of Mark  Zuckerberg's testimony before House lawmakers today, starts at 10:00a.m.  Eastern Time.  </p><p> Meantime, Bank of America's big move against guns, the bank won't lend to  companies that make so-called assault weapons for civilian use.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p> And time is up, House Intel share Devin Nunes is done waiting for the FBI  and DOJ to hand over Russia probe documents.  And now he says it's time for  someone at the top to face serious consequences.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sprint and T-Mobile talking about a merger again.  Cheryl Casone  has the detail, Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, really Dagen.  The third fourth largest  U.S. wireless carriers are back in the negotiating table again.  The merger  would lump together 127 million customers and get some serious competition  to Verizon and AT&amp;T, that nation's top two providers.</p><p>T-mobile and Sprint were in talks before but those ended because the  (INAUDIBLE) valuation disagreements between the two companies.  Since then,  Sprint stock has taken a dive, it lost about a fifth of its value.  The  company has long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Shares of T-mobile  are also down nearly six percent year-to-date.  So, we shall see.</p><p> Theranos is making some major job cuts, report say the blood testing firm  laying off almost everybody that works there in an effort to keep the  company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoffs chopped the company's  workforce from 125 to about two dozen employees, that is way down from  2015, they had 800 people there at the time.  Founder and CEO Elizabeth  Homes has announced the staffing changes nearly a month after settling  civil fraud charges with the SEC which forced her to give a voting control  over her own company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p> Well, WalletHub has released its annual list of best places to live for  millennials.  Here are the top three states, Minnesota ranked high on the  list coming in at number three.  North Dakota coming in at number two,  these are very cool places.  And then get this, the top spot not  technically a state but it's the nation's capital.  According to the study,  Washington, D.C. the best place for millennials to live.</p><p> Millennials make up 35 percent of D.C.'s workforce, key indicators of  living standards like average monthly earnings for millennials and, of  course, the unemployment rate for them were looked at.  D.C. millennials  say that the abundance of people their age is also a big attraction for  moving there.  So, staying with the younger generation, looks like young  adults, the share of them that are living with their parents is right now  at the highest in 75 years.  This is depressing parents.  </p><p> A few research center study found that 33 percent of 25 to 29-year-olds  live with their parents or their grandparents in 2016, that's almost three  times as many that live with their parents, Dagen, in 1970.  I don't know  about you, but when I was 18, I got out of high school my parents were  like, \"Bye, good luck.  Take care.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  My dad gave me $20 when I graduated from college and said,  \"Hey kiddo, I can't find you a job.  If you get married, here's $20, elope,  I don't want to know about it.\"  Said, \"That's a dowry.\"</p><p> CASONE:  Same story, yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Is that exactly what you did?</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No -- yes, actually, about 10 years later.  Thanks Collin for  bringing up that happy memory.  Think of -- what do you think of  millennials living at home?</p><p> JAIN:  Oh, rent is so expensive nowadays.  I mean, this is the problem.   Like you're spending 55, 60 percent of your income in New York on rent,  it's no surprise people were staying at home.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You actually have backed a company that's trying to connect the  -- that's trying to ease the down -- the -- not the down payment but the  security deposit.</p><p> JAIN:  Right.  So actually, one of our biggest focuses right now at Kairos  is building new technologies to help reduce the cost of rent.  The one  you're talking about is Rhino.</p><p> One of the problems of renting is not just the monthly recurring cost, just  to move in to a place, you're spending $10,000 plus.  Nobody has that kind  of liquid cash coming out of college.  So we basically created a company  that waive security deposits for folks.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  I just moved and it's been a pain in the butt with all upfront  cost and then you have to buy furniture and different things like that,  find a new gym and --</p><p> JAIN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I suspect you saw that list to the best places for millennials  to live, Minnesota and North Dakota is because the cost of living is so  low.  </p><p> JAIN:  Actually, I also got to find that list.  I don't know who came up  with that.</p><p> BELL:  Well D.C., the technology corridor could be potential driver. </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's true, it's not just politics.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you're an entrepreneur encore, you can start a business  anywhere, even in North Dakota.  </p><p> JAIN:  I agree with you.  I mean, I just think -- I will be shocked if you  surveyed a random poll of millennials and that that was the order of  favorite cities.</p><p> MCSHANE:  The good shell oil start-up in North Dakota.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Again, the future.  Coming up, all options on the  table, that's the word from the White House as the president looks to show  force against Syria.  </p><p> And you'll be digging deeper this summer to drive and fill up your tank,  gas prices spiking.  We'll tell you why the real sticker shock may be from  your gas station credit card bill.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The art of a trade war, U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers squaring off.  According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. trade  officials are laying blame on Chinese firms for rerouting goods to other  countries to get around tariffs.</p><p> And this coming after China said it would open market and ease some import  tariffs particularly on auto imports.  Futures are looking like this this  morning, again, the selloff is picking up steam, it was a great day for  stocks yesterday.  We have a 181 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p> Joining me from the CME Group, the PRICE Futures Group and FOX News  Contributor, Phil Flynn.  What do you make of this latest development Phil?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think when we're looking at the  difficulties of actually enforcing a potential trade war when it comes to  transshipping.  And if you look at the markets today, we're really trying  to balance the reducing risk of a trade war versus a rising risk of a real  war in Syria.</p><p> So you have a lot of dynamics to play with the markets, a lot of  nervousness.  But actually, I guess I have to say that President Donald  Trump strong line with China appears to be bearing fruit.  And overnight,  of course, President Trump tweeted and basically thanked President Jinping  from China for his kind words on the tariffs and talking about his problems  with intellectual property.  So it looks like President Trump's strong arm  has -- bearing some fruit this morning.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, it's interesting Phil the President Xi's comments, how they  worked into markets yesterday and then no doubt played a role especially in  the stock market in the gains we saw and you're right, we got a talk coming  up I think about Syria that maybe that hasn't affect on today's selloff  that we're seeing.</p><p> But do you think President Xi knew exactly what he was doing there?  In  other words, this is going to be a long drawn out process, these  negotiations and he -- I would bet that he knew by saying what he said that  the markets would react as they react, maybe buys him a little bit of time  too to negotiate.</p><p> FLYNN:  I think he did.  I think he wanted to lower the temperature a  little bit.  If you remember China started the week off really tough,  putting sanctions on U.S. soybeans which was basically their nuclear  options.</p><p> I think President Xi wanted to ratchet down the tensions and basically give  up on what he knows is indefensible.  I think everybody in the world  realizes that the Chinese import tariffs on cars is way out of whack, the  entire world knows that that's indefensible.  The stealing of intellectual  property, everybody's against that.  Everybody knows that China is playing  fast and loose with the rules.</p><p> So I think on the things that were indefensible, he's going to come out and  try to adjust their position and I think it does open the doors for  negotiations and there probably will be no trade war.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  From your mouth Phil, thank you so much.  Phil Flynn from CME  Group, we'll see you soon.</p><p> Serious action for Syria, the president weighing a massive military strike  and what that would mean for the United States and our relationship -- our  tense relationship with Russia.  </p><p> And forget Sci-Fi images of the surface of the moon, there's a new 4K view  of the planet that you will not be able to take your eyes off of, that's  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure this morning, we have 179-point loss on the Dow Futures, a  weaker open for stocks is on deck.  Investors are waiting on inflation data  and minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, coming out later today,  maybe its concerns about Syria and a strike, an impending strike.  </p><p> This, coming after a big rally yesterday, China said it would open up its  economy and makes some concessions on the tensed trade relationship the  U.S. has with China.  Checking global market action in Europe, markets are  edging lower.  And in Asia overnight, it was mixed action, the two markets  there that headed south, the Nikkei in Japan and KOSPI in South Korea.   Targeting Syria, President Trump looking to rally support for a possible  missile strike against Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We're going to  continue to work with a number of our partners and allies as we determine  what the next best steps are.  I just saw the troops yesterday.  I don't  have anything new on that front in terms of things that the President may  or may not do.  We are not going to broadcast.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This, as the United States positions warships within firing  range of Syria.  Deadline day, the FBI and justice department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to essentially spying on a  U.S. citizen, Carter Page, that counterintelligence Russia investigation.   The House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, threatening legal  action if law enforcement does not comply.  </p><p>Bank of America, taking action on guns, it will stop lending the gun makers  that produce so-called assault-style weapons for civilians.  Peak driving  season, kicking off in a few weeks, new numbers show you'll be paying more  at the pump, more on that, plus, the fresh warning for drivers over gas  station credit cards.  </p><p> A night, 10 years in the making, one NBA player debuting with a  performance, so good, it could not even have been scripted any better, we  have the highlights, and a whole new way to see space, NASA unveiling a  virtual tour of the moon.  </p><p> But, first, the Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike on Syria, the prospects for U.S. action, rising yesterday,  after Russia rejected a U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate the  alleged chemical weapon's attack.  White House Press Secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders weighed in yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  The President has been clear, we're working with our partners and  allies and our National Security team to look at all options and as we've  said, all options are on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of  anything the President may or may not do in response to what's taking place  in Syria.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This coming as a European air traffic control agency is  reportedly alerting airlines to exercise caution due to potential air  strike in Syria in the next three days.  Joining us now, is National  Security Analyst for the Clarion Project, Professor of Counter-Terrorism at  Liberty University, Ryan Mauro.  Ryan, you were previously a volunteer  researching for a Syria opposition group before the Civil War started.   What is your take on this?  What does the U.S. need to do here?</p><p> RYAN MAURO, PROFESSOR OF COUNTER-TERRORISM, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY:  Well, the  immediate objective is to have some type of deterrent effect on Assad, so  that the chemical weapons attacks and other forms of attacks, like the  barrel bombs, can be stopped.  </p><p> And that's very doable because he has a weak air force, we have the  capability to strike at his shipments of fuel, the stuff that's coming in  and out of the ports that the Russians have to use, so there's plenty of  targets that are vulnerable, hitting just a handful of them, would have a  dramatic effect on the ground and has to be more than punishment.  </p><p> What has to happen is that the dictator Assad has to actually look at the  situation and say, my chances of losing this war go up when I do things  like this, and therefore I'm going to stop doing it, and that's the  calculation we have to aim for.</p><p> JAIN:  Even if he has Russia on his side, preventing that?</p><p> BELL:  Russia did say, they came out this morning.  I saw a news report  that said they would retaliate, they would look to stop any missiles coming  to Syria and they would strike any places where those missiles were coming  from.</p><p> MAURO:  We've heard that every time there's been some type of confrontation  with a Russian ally, that's, kind of, just how they talk.  And if you look  at what happened with the air strike last year, we gave a warning to the  Russians.  They got their people out so that there weren't casualties.   There was an arrangement.  And giving that heads-up, doesn't really make  much of a difference if you're going after hard targets because you can't  pick those up and that's really what you're going after.</p><p> MCSHANE:  This is more aggressive than that (INAUDIBLE) what you're talking  about is a step-up from what we did last year, so there has to be more risk  involved, no?</p><p> MAURO:  There is.  Any time you have a greater number of strikes, there's a  greater number of risks, obviously, especially if it's missiles coming from  the sea and hitting these parts, especially the shipments, so that you  can't get supplies in and out, that's very doable and it's not something  that Russia's going to want the risk a war over.  Will they try to shoot  down some cruise missiles, maybe launch a cyber-attack?  Probably, because  Putin always has, at the end of the day, be able to say, look, there's a  proof that America is weak and I'm the future of the world, give him that,  you know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is the -- what is the end objective here?  Because we had  one strike on an airfield last year, there was a chlorine gas attack  earlier this year, in January, which our response was, essentially a letter  from the state department.  There was no force taken, at all, and that  sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, does it not?  So what is the end  objective to essentially take out the air force, Assad's air force here?</p><p> MAURO:  That's what I think it's going to be.  It may not be the explicit  objectives, they'll say no more planes in the sky at all, but it'll be at  least cripple it to the point where there is a difference on the ground and  that advantage is lost by Assad and that increases the pressure on him.  </p><p> And in the past, when it looked like Assad was going to lose significant  territory, the Russian tone did change, they would said, we like Assad,  he's our friend, but we are not dedicated only to him, and you would  actually have people opposed to Assad that were going over to Russia.  So,  Russia wants a puppet state, they want a military base there, and they  think Assad is a loser, they will look to somebody else.  So, I don't rule  out the possibility of cooperating with the Russians in the future, if we  handle this very carefully.</p><p> MCSHANE:  This coalition -- I'm sorry, the coalition --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what I want to ask.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  fairly easy, I mean, do you think that (INAUDIBLE) France, like  the U.K., Saudi Arabia?</p><p> MAURO:  Coalition is done.  So many people hate Assad, that that's just a  matter of few phone calls.  I am concerned of what allies we get involved  in this, like, Qatar.  As opposed an ally, that supports every enemy of  ours, Turkey, especially, Turkey always demands that we ditch our allies,  the Kurds, and their reliance that includes Christians.  </p><p> So, I get worried about the influence of these partners giving us bad  advice for their own selfish aims.  But, I think we should, particularly,  Northern Syria, double down on the Kurds and their alliance there because  you're actually seeing the beginnings of a Democratic future in that part  of Syria.  It's an amazing story that's not told.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just one last thing before we move onto another topic, but in  terms of Syria, does this mean the U.S. is not getting out of Syria, as  President Trump --again, President Trump linked that to ISIS being on the  run, but this is the most serious problem for the Syrian people, is the  leader who is still there, are we there for, maybe, even a few years to  come?</p><p> MAURO:  Oh, yes, definitely, because even if he were to go back to original  position, say look, Assad is not a concern anymore, my concern is just  ISIS.  There are terrorist groups even worse than ISIS right now, in Syria,  including Al-Qaeda which basically has an army of 20 to 25,000 people that  they've never had before, and there are other groups.  So, any foreign  policy that focuses solely on ISIS, is problematic, maybe because I see  what's coming around the corner and it could be worse.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And i was critical for years of the foreign policy in the  position of the Obama administration that they created this power vacuum  overseas and the suggestion that we are getting out of Syria would do the  very same thing.</p><p> MAURO:  And it's a terrible signal to send also, especially when you don't  have benchmarks and say, we're going to accomplish A,B, and C, before that  happens.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  I want to move on, Ryan, switch gears to back here at  home, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, calling out the  Justice Department for failing to provide an unredacted two-page document,  this is an electronic communication used to formally begin the Russia  probe, the California Congressman laying out the potential consequences  last night on the Ingraham Angle.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I did just tell you that we're not going to just hold and contempt, we will  have a plan to hold and contempt and to impeach.</p><p> LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p> NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Rob Rosenstein?</p><p> NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, your reaction to that?</p><p> MAURO:  This type of stuff drives me crazy with the government  bureaucracies, because whether they are trying to cover up something or  they're just being difficult.  This is actually a threat to our democracy.   Move beyond the issue of Trump and the politics of the day, this is the  type of thing that members of congress, researchers like myself, encounter  constantly, you ask for something reasonable.  </p><p> They refuse to give it to you, they'll fight to the death, but not give it  to you, and when you get it, it's a redacted piece of paper with, like, two  words, the and a, and then you have to go over and fight it over again.   There is a major crisis of transparency in the government that this is  touching upon beyond the politics of today with the whole probe with  Russia.</p><p> MCSHANE:  So, I wondering, though,  just listening what Nunes said there,  if there's some -- if there's some, or at least is worth questioning,  whether or not there's some aspect of Nunes during the President's bidding  here on the question over Rosenstein and the question of Christopher Wray,  the President has talked openly about in the last few days of getting rid  of, for lack of a better term.  </p><p> So, that's -- I mean, that's where -- and Nunes was talking about on a  different subject, but he said, we won't hold back, we don't go after these  guys and none of those two were related.  It's going to be interesting to  watch when you think of that though.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But if they did their job, it wouldn't be (INAUDIBLE) it was  Wray and Rosenstein, did their job and didn't act like they were, kind of,  hide something about this investigation.  It would be a moot point and you  could make that connection with President and his legal problems and what's  going within the FBI and the JOY, in terms of, well, stonewalling.</p><p> MAURO:  I agree, and just all the parties involved in this, I'm really,  greatly, disappointed because you're a supporter of the President or you're  against them.  Whoever's representing you right now, the dialogue that goes  along with it, I find to be destructive.  I mean, the morale, right now,  the FBI deal, you deal with FBI personal constantly.  I've never seen it so  low.  </p><p> And so, even from Trump's side, some of the rhetoric come seeing -- it  really does bother me when I see how that impacts people who sacrificed a  lot, not just risking their lives, but look at what this type of services  does to marriages, their families, sacrificed a lot.  </p><p> And then they'd get basically branded as an agency, as a whole, as being  politicized or corrupt.  And by the way, we're talking about classified  information, so that's why I don't make these final assessments as, oh,  what happened or didn't happen because 90 percent what you're talking  about, is not available to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> MAURO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks for being here.  You covered a lot of ground for us, Ryan  Mauro.  Coming up, brace yourself before you put the pedal to the metal.   This summer, gas prices are on the rise, but apparently not as high as the  interest on your gas station credit card, we will explain.  And hope dreams  do come true, one basketball player delivering a slam dunk in his long- awaited NBA debut.  That's ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bank of America entering the gun control debate.  Cheryl Casone  has more on this story, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, they are, Dagen.  The bank it's going to stop lending to  companies that produce military-style firearms for civilian use -- an  attempt to curb mass shootings.  The bank telling gunmakers and doesn't  want to underwrite or finance these firearms.  And its told the number of  gun manufacturers that will no longer do business with them.  Shares of  Bank of America are slightly lower; down almost one percent in the  premarket. </p><p> Well, get ready to pay more at the pump this summer.  The government  estimates prices could jump as much as 14 percent to average of $2.74 a  gallon nationwide.  You can blame the expected increase on OPEC and Russia  which agreed to cut production in 2016, and those cuts have been extended  through the end of this year.  Regular gas right now hitting its price of  the year, $2.66 a gallon for the week.  Well, a new study is finding that  gas credit cards carry much higher interest rates than regular credit  cards.  Creditcards.com is reporting that average rate for gasoline credit  cards, 24 percent.  The national average for general credit card is about  17 percent.  </p><p> And flying to the moon has never been so easy and so cheap thanks to NASA.   We now have the opportunity to tour our closest neighbor in 4k high depth.   This new video shows images that have been collected over the last nine  years by NASA's lunar orbiter.  It gives us an extremely detailed look at  the moon's surface.  What's very cool?  You can see the sight of Apollo  17's rover and lunar landing -- completely, Dagen, untouched, since 1972.   So, I know you were thinking: oh, great, a cheap flight to the moon.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You know, we actually have somebody who can talk about  traveling to the moon onset.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I actually was born the year that we landed on the moon.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's incredible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know it's sad.  </p><p> JAIN:  In fact, we own a company called Moon Express and we're actually  sending the first private rockets to the moon at the end of this year, just  to get -- you're talking about regulations and tariffs and all this.  Our  primary mission to the moon is actually the mind for platinum and bring it  back.  And we had to go through so many hoops to get the White House and  Congress to approve sending anything past Earth's orbit, and the next  battle is going to be: how to bring stuff back.  So, it's all fun and games  to play around with the virtual reality of the moon, but it's going to be  really, really fun when we get to send people to the moon.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Any suggestions on who we want to send or not bring back?  </p><p> BELL:  How soon are we be doing this?</p><p> JAIN:  It's the first unmanned rocket.  Probably, at the end of the year.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's cool.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Where are you launching from?  Where's the launch?  </p><p> JAIN:  NASA actually gave us the basic Cape Canaveral, where the original  Apollo mission launch.  So, it's going to be a nice, kind of, historic  moment.  We're thinking about timing, it would be -- at 2019, next year. </p><p> MCSHANE:  yeah.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's fantastic.  Ankur, thank you for sharing that with us.  </p><p> JAIN:  Exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, it also inspires young people to be entrepreneurs and  literally reach for the star.  </p><p> Breaking news, President Trump just tweeted this: \"So much fake news about  what is going on in the White House.  Very calm and calculated with the big  focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting  and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.  Feels great to have  Bolton and Larry K. (Larry Kudlow) on board.  I (we) are doing things that  nobody thought possible despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia  investigation which takes tremendous time and focus.  No collusion or  obstruction other than I fight back.  So, now, they do the unthinkable and  raid a lawyer's office for information.  BAD!\"  All caps, exclamation  point.  </p><p> Coming up, Sister Jean's rock star status continues, despite Loyola  Chicago's heartbreaking the final four.  This time, the sister is blessing  the Chicago Cubs with the first pitch.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The L.A. Lakers are not going to the NBA playoffs but they gave  us quite a Hollywood story last night.  Jared Max is here to explain,  Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  This one reminds me  of the NBA version of the 2002 baseball movie, \"The Rookie\".  Remember  Dennis Quaid for a trade and aging pitcher, who finally got shot in big  leagues?  Andre Ingram, who spent 10 years in the NBA Developmental League,  playing in small cities, traveling often by bus to stay in the game.  At  age 32, Ingram made his NBA debut last night.  Lakers fans at Staples  Center went batty.  Ingram's story book night's on and hit his first four  shots, include the three all three points.  He shot six of eight from the  field.  Scored 19 points, blocked three shots, the crowd even chanted MVP,  MVP.  Ingram scored more points in his NBA debut than any player in the  last 50 seasons -- a dream come true.  Remember, Linsanity, Jeremy Lin, who  lit up in Knicks in the NBA six season ago.  Overnight super star from the  minor leagues, Lin tweeted: \"Anyone who has chased hoop dreams can  appreciate this, too good.\"  Playoffs start Saturday, by the way.  </p><p> Just over two months since the Alabama Crimson Tide won college football's  national championship.  The team met with President Trump yesterday at the  White House.  And forget about players protesting, Head Coach Nick Saban  reportedly held a team meeting and said we're doing this regardless of your  political beliefs.  Saban was asked if called any recruits from the White  House.  Take a listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NICK SABAN, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA:  Absolutely.  I  mean, why wouldn't I?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many?  </p><p> SABAN:  Probably half a dozen.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  From the oval?  </p><p> SABAN:  No, no, I -- from -- I get these rooms confused around here.  So,  but it was in the White House, and it was good.  But I didn't want to have  any violations if the president talks to any recruits for us.  That would  have been the NCAA would have jumped all over that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Like you hear the president say roll tide yesterday.  Changes is  coming to some NFL uniforms next season.  The color rush monochrome jerseys  we've seen teams wear on Thursday night games, last couple of seasons.  It  won't be a Thursday staples.  Teams get more flexibility now to wear these  color rush jerseys where they want, and also maybe change them.  Oh, hey,  look who threw the ceremonial first pitch yesterday at Wrigley Field?  For  the Cubs home opener along with members of the Loyola Chicago basketball  team, the NCAA Cinderella's Sister Jean, age 98, puts the ball in play.   Unfortunately, for Cubs' fans, the Pirates won.  (INAUDIBLE) the players  from Loyola squad, of course, saying the take me out to the ball game --  the tradition.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a better pitch than I've seen in some and delivered it  at games.  </p><p> BELL:  For a 98-year-old.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCSHANE:  It was a good pitch for a 98-year-old woman.  Do we have data to  compare that?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I turned to Connell.  Connell's first's job was -- he was of  baseball -- </p><p> MCSHANE:  Baseball play by play, right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's was the first --</p><p> MCSHANE:  I throw the first pitch from, and that was, yes, not as good as  Sister Jean.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Since you're here, Connell, I'm going to give you a NASCAR  story.  Kyle Busch --</p><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, come on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's warming hearts around the world.  He surprised a young fan  at an In and Out drive through.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> KYLE BUSCH, RACE CAR DRIVER, NASCAR:  Can you -- that kid in the yellow  sweatshirt right over there? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes?</p><p> BUSCH:  Can you give it to him?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of course.</p><p> BUSCH:  Thank you.  All right.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good job today.  </p><p> BUSCH:  I appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Dagen, so often stars, it doesn't matter what field you're in, go  running from their fans.  I love to see Kyle Busch's attitude all the time.   He wants to sign somebody's R.V., he likes to pop in and surprise people.   He saw the kid was wearing his number.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, he's wearing a Kyle Busch sweatshirt, it looks like,  because those are Kyle's color.  And he had a big win at a Texas motor  speedway over the weekend.  But again, these NASCAR drivers actually don't  get recognized.  Because they're very average looking, so.  </p><p> MAX:  No, helmets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What?</p><p> MAX:  Nothing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, no helmets.  Thank you, Jared. </p><p> MAX:  I'm up for double-double right.  I'll have an In and Out double- double burger.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How far do you have to drive for In and Out?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  California.</p><p> MAX:  I don't know.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Not bad for a 98-year-old, Jared.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jared's sports report, Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.   Still ahead, eating like a snake can help you lose weight.  That's the  theory behind a new trendy diet.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, April 11th.  </p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. eastern.</p><p> The bulls trying to fight back -- they did yesterday, a 428-point gain on  the Dow yesterday.  We had gains across the board.  The biggest mover of  those three market gauges was the Nasdaq composite gaining more than 2  percent.</p><p> Yesterday with some comment very early in the morning East Coast time from  China's President Xi Jinping who promised to open that market and cut  tariffs on auto imports.</p><p> The Dow swung more than 300 points during the trading day for the 14th  straight time marking the longest such stretch ever.</p><p> And also with some good news on Capitol Hill with Mark Zuckerberg doing an  A -- A minus, A plus job even testifying in front of those senators.</p><p> It's a different story this morning, futures are showing losses -- 177  point loss on the Dow futures right now.  Some concerns about what will  happen with Syria and when the U.S. with partners will strike.</p><p> In Europe stocks mostly lower, losses across the board there.</p><p> And it was mixed markets in Asia with Shanghai and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong but gaining half of 1 percent.</p><p> One of the top winners yesterday was, as I said, Facebook -- shares seeing  their largest gain in two years up 4.5 percent as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced  a grilling on Capitol Hill on everything from the Cambridge Analytica  scandal, Russian election interference, bias toward conservative news.   Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  The most important thing that I care about  right now is making sure that no one interferes in the various 2018  elections around the world.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he's set  to testify before House lawmakers.  Fox Business will bring you live  coverage starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Immigration battle -- yet another California town taking on the state,  challenging sanctuary city laws.

The new mile-high perks that  airbus is planning.</p><p> Here to break it all down with me is CFRA investment strategist Lindsay  Bell, Fox Business' Connell McShane, Kairos founder who once was an  executive at Tinder, Ankur Jain.  That's where -- I am not wrong.  He was - - </p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  No, I was there.  I was part of Tinder for a  while after signing the last company to them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So based on that, Mark Zuckerberg -- he is really -- he's an  admirable performer.  </p><p> JAIN:  He really did -- as you say, he did a great job.  I think the big  question now is do the congressmen have the ability to ask the right  questions?</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  No.</p><p> JAIN:  And if they don't are they in the right place to set the  regulations?  And if not how do the tech companies work with Congress to  make sure the right regulations get in place?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad privacy protections are the consensus there -- </p><p> JAIN:  And transparency, I think.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's been said for years.  Facebook was reckless.  They were  reckless.  They didn't protect people.  They didn't tell people how their  data was being used properly.  And now this is what happens.</p><p> JAIN:  Well, it's like -- Facebook's 14 years old, it's like when was the  last time a teenager made all the right decisions?  And I think, you know - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He tried to drop that excuse referencing his dorm room.  Come  on, move on -- Mark.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Move on.</p><p> MCSHANE:  But you don't (INAUDIBLE) outsmart these guys for one day and you  know more about your own industry than they do doesn't necessarily mean  you're going to evade regulation, long term.  I'm thinking about -- I was  covering the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case for a while and there's a lot of jokes  going back and forth among reporters that the judge didn't understand the  technology.  Well, the judge has a number of clerks that may understand the  technology.  </p><p> These Senators and congress people have a number of aides that may  understand the technology.  So that's part of this, too.</p><p> JAIN:  Anyway -- I do think that at the end of the day Facebook is open to  regulation.  So is Google, so is Apple.  So everybody wants to move this  floor in a productive way.  It's just a matter of doing it in the right  process.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well said but I would like them to cut the let's all join hands.   It's the summer love mantra coming out of Facebook.</p><p> Breaking news -- President Trump has tweeted this, moments ago on Syria,  \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready,  Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  You shouldn't  be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.\"   Strong words from President Trump.</p><p> Coming up this morning, we're going to speak with House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling; House Judiciary Committee  member Congressman Ted Poe; former Republican presidential candidate Herman  Cain will be here; and Dr. Mikhail Varshavski -- Dr. Mike.</p><p> But right here, right now we have the judge standing by to talk about one  of our top stories this morning.  We were talking about Facebook and the  testimony from Zuckerberg yesterday.  But let's talk about Facebook's role  in the Russia meddling probe. </p><p> CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed during that testimony that the tech titan is  working with Special counsel Robert Mueller.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I assume Facebook has been served with subpoenas from  special counsel Mueller's office.  Is that correct?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the  special counsel's office?  </p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Have you been interviewed?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  Let me clarify that.  I actually am not aware of  a subpoena.  I believe that there may be.  But I know we're working with  them.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me right now Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- just your thoughts.  </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Well, sometimes  when the government wants information it breaks down doors like it did to  the doors of the Trump Organization at 5:30 in the morning to get to  Michael Cohen's records on the inside.  And sometimes it just says Mr.  Zuckerberg, can we speak to your people?  No search warrant, no FBI agents,  no guns drawn, no subpoena.</p><p> So I would imagine that they used a softer approach with Mr. Zuckerberg's  people than they did with Michael Cohen.  Meaning they sent some FBI agents  there to engage in what appeared to be friendly conversations about how --  tell us how you know who is placing these ads.  Are these Russians?  Are  these people who are pretending to be Americans?</p><p> Give us the technology.  Talk us through it.  And they probably willingly  did and he might be personally unfamiliar -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- with the conversation.  He may think it's pursuant to a  subpoena.  My guess is it is probably just a friendly request.  The  government comes knocking and they ask you to talk to them, you can say  yes, you can say no.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But my reaction to that was I wonder if people will be upset  that without a subpoena that Facebook potentially hands over or reveals  private information that's on the network because I just go back to Apple.   And Apple fighting tooth and nail in the court system to avoid rewriting an  operating system to allow the FBI in to look at the San Bernardino killer's  phone.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My buddies at the FBI were not happy with me but I cheered  Apple on, they did the exact right thing for their customers.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- and I realize now why Apple did it.  I realize  now because now Tim Cook has two strong legs to stand on -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in terms of protecting people's privacy.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  Now, we don't know -- Senator Leahy in my view asked  the right questions.  He could have gone deeper but I don't know that Mark  Zuckerberg would have known the answer.  We don't know exactly what  information Bob Mueller's people, FBI agents, got from the Facebook team --  whether they got personal private information.</p><p> Theoretically, theoretically, if Facebook received a subpoena for Dagen  McDowell's account they would notify you to give you and your lawyers the  opportunity to negotiate the subpoena or to ask a judge to quash it.  I say  theoretically.  That doesn't always work that way.</p><p> MCSHANE:  And it didn't -- I mean it's not -- I mean it's not apples to  apples on the comparison but id didn't work that way in the Cambridge  Analytica case, right.  And that's where it got brought up a little bit  yesterday and that's why -- I think that's sort of at the heart of this  matter is what are we as users of Facebook -- there's so much focus  yesterday on how they use their data for advertising.  That's their  business model -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCSHANE:  -- but what are we as users of Facebook have a right to know.  So  if there's a breach of my data, somebody gets my credit card information,  that day the bank's telling me, hey they got your credit card, you need to  get a new card.</p><p> Whereas in the Cambridge Analytica case, they took forever to call.  They  didn't tell anybody.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out something real quick.  This is beyond - - to understand what Facebook was doing -- from 2007 until 2015, it's not  about Cambridge Analytica.  It's about your information being accessed by a  friends' app -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And no one knew -- no one knew that any app developer was  accessing your information.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Fully agreed -- fully agreed and you know, we are talking  about a private entity here that has agreements with the Federal Trade  Commission to inform Connell if for example there was a breach of your  account and the failure to do that result in a fine, sounds small, but do  the math of $40,000 per breach.   </p><p> JAIN:  You had 87 million breaches -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  Do the math, 710 that is a huge number even for  Zuckerberg.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And by the way, that consent decree was put in place two years  before they actually ended the practice of letting all the app developers  access the information from not only the app users but the friends of the  app users.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  All right.  Can I talk to you about delicious irony?  These  senators ranting and raving about Facebook violating privacy, what is the  greatest violator of personal privacy on the planet?  The federal  government.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTIGATION STRATEGIST, CFRA:  The government.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government that they run and that they fund and that they  authorize.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sorry.</p><p> JAIN:  No, we were just -- we were just saying that.  I mean the amount of  data -- what data does the federal government not have access to anyway  they are looking for from Facebook for this particular case.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that there is an answer to that question.  They  can get everything.</p><p> JAIN:  That's right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They know everywhere I go when this is with me, every  conversation I had, even when you and I talk in the greenroom, every e-mail  that I send and every text that I send.  It's not just me.  It's all of us.</p><p> JAIN:  Everyone is worried about Facebook listening to your microphone but  the Feds actually have the ability to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  The judge is worked up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge, not that that helps.</p><p> But the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke about  Mueller's investigation yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein oversees the special counsel and only  he has the power to fire the special counsel.  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Again, we've been  advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  these comments of course, after the FBI raided the office, the  home and the hotel room of longtime personal attorney to President Trump,  Michael Cohen.  That raid has raising questions about attorney-client  privilege.  What about firing Mueller in that as well?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Ok.  Let's start with firing Mueller.  There are areas of the  law that are very clear.  Go 30 miles an hour in front of the Fox Building,  you get a ticket because the speed limit is 25.  There's really no dispute.   The cops have discretion if you're doing 25 and 30.</p><p> Can the President of the United States fire a special counsel?  The law is  unclear.  There is a federal regulation that governs the Justice Department  that says specifically only the appointing authority, in this case Rod  Rosenstein, can fire the special counsel and it has got to be for cause.</p><p> There is other authority that says the President runs the executive branch  of the government and he can fire whoever he wants for any sound reason, a  person in the executive branch that's not protected by civil service.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President could rescind that law that gives Rosenstein the  authority to fire him, could he?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No.  Only Congress can.  It is in the CFR.  It's easy for  Congress to do that, the Code of Federal Regulations but it would require  Congress to do that.  That law comes about -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JAIN:  -- the investigation. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That has never been tested before.  But when Richard Nixon had  Professor Archibald Cox fired, he directed his attorney general to do it,  the attorney general resigned.  He directed the number two person at DOJ to  do it.  That person resigned.  He directed the number three person to do  it, Bob Bork of notoriety later on in life.  He fired the special counsel  and was replaced by another special counsel as we know undid the President.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we should also point out that it was revealed last week the  Mueller probe, they don't view President Trump as a criminal target.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They view him as a subject.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A subject but not -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You could go from subject to target -- </p><p> MCSHANE:  It could change.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- like that.  </p><p> Now here is what is interesting -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- if I could between the lines, in the weeds, whatever phrase  you want to use about what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday.  They did  research.  They dispatched lawyers to give them a legal opinion, the White  House as to whether or not the President of the United States on his own  bypassing the AG, bypassing the deputy attorney general could single- handedly fire Bob Mueller and their research told them yes.</p><p> Why did they do that research?  It remains to be seen.  </p><p> BELL:  Wouldn't he rather prefer to fire Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Rod Rosenstein.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Would that look better.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and was confirmed by the Senate.</p><p> He can fire Rod Rosenstein just like he could fire any cabinet officer.   Politically it would be damaging but legally he could do it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turn your location services off -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You better show me how to do it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to make you laugh before you went. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure -- guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Such a pleasure, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> Fox Business Network will bring you Zuckerberg's testimony live at 10:00  a.m.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news -- a plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  We're just getting some new  numbers then -- Dagen.  Good morning.</p><p> An Algerian military jet has crashed near the country's capital killing at  least 257 people.  The plane came down near a military base shortly after  it took off.  Authorities there say some survivors have been rescued.  It  is not clear what caused this crash but it's the worst plane crash in  Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet went down killing 102 people.</p><p> Well, let's head back home to south Florida, that state hit by two  tornadoes.  The National Weather Service says the first one struck downtown  Fort Lauderdale yesterday afternoon packing winds of up to 65 miles an hour  -- look at that.  The twister knocked out power, thousands delayed hundreds  of flights out of the airport there.</p><p> The second tornado touched down near Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Airport  about an hour later with winds topping out at 84 miles an hour.  One of the  runways was closed for more than two hours while crews picked up all of the  debris.  Look at those crushed metal.</p><p> Well, Chevrolet is stepping up its challenge to Ford, showing off its next- generation Silverado and it is enormous.  2020 Silverado HD is going to  built in Flint, Michigan.  It's going to roll off the production line in  the third quarter of 2019.  Ford has dominated the pickup truck segment and  Chevy is hoping hopes to close the gap with three new Silverado's.  Shares  of General Motors are down 7 percent so far this year.</p><p> Ok.  Chick-Fil-A has won top-rankings of food quality and customer service.   Now, it looks like they've won over teenagers.  And a survey of teens from  Piper Jaffray, Chick-Fil-A beat out chains including, get this, Starbucks,  Chipotle, even McDonald's.  Chick-Fil-A has an established following in the  south.  Now, the chain is gaining fans in places like New York City because  it's right down that street, and the Midwest.  In 2017 Chick-Fil-A reported  one of the $9 billion in revenue up more than a billion from 2016.  And by  2020 Chick-Fil-A is expected by some analysts to be the third largest  restaurant chain in the United States by sales anyway -- Dagen.</p><p> And true story, when I was in high school I worked at Chick-Fil-A.  Yes, at  the mall in Phoenix, Arizona and then they found out that I was lying about  my age and they fired me.  But it was a fun couple of weeks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  By the way, people love Chick-Fil-A because the people who  operate the franchises and the people who work there are nice. </p><p> CASONE:  They're nice.  Yes.  The food is good.  Chicken is good.  Like I  said, down the street.  I know you won't go there but I might -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a giant one down at the Fulton Street Market -- </p><p> CASONE:  New York.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- the biggest in the country, by the way.  </p><p> CASONE:  New Yorkers love it, man.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, New Yorkers do like nice people.  </p><p> Coming up easing tensions over tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping  sparking a rally yesterday with comments on the opening up about the  economy.  We'll look at the chances that we avoid trade war.</p><p> And a whole new meaning to watching the scales -- why doctors are warning  the snake diet is going viral.  You don't eat snakes -- we will explain  straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The art of trade war -- U.S. trade officials and Chinese metal  importers going head to head.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" U.S.  trade official are laying blame on Chinese metal firms for rerouting goods  to other countries like Vietnam in order to skirt tariffs.  This coming  after Chinese President Xi Jinping said that he would open markets and ease  some import tariffs yesterday.</p><p> Futures are looking like this, this morning.  We ought to point out that  the futures took a turn even lower with a 268-point loss on the Dow futures  right now right after President Trump sent out that tweet on Syria about  Russia.</p><p> So I want to point out that that is why you are seeing the selling pick up  steam as we move a little bit more than two hours away from the opening  bell.</p><p> Joining me now is Payden &amp; Rygel chief economist Jeffrey Cleveland -- what  to make of the trade issue.  That seems to have been rocking markets  lately.  But this all started -- the volatility came back with a vengeance  in early February because of concerns about inflation and higher interests  rates.  So what is it?  </p><p> JEFFREY CLEVELAND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PAYDEN AND RYGEL:  Well, I think the  trade story is like so many narratives in the market, you know, people get  really attached to them it becomes -- it dominates headlines and then it  goes away because we make too much of it.</p><p> That is how I remember last year and the Fed's balance sheet story,  remember how the Fed was going to shrink its balance sheet and that it was  going to be a big deal.  That didn't happen.</p><p> Before that, you know, you had things like the fiscal cliff.  So I think  that is what, for me, the trade story is.  It doesn't change our overall  growth outlook.  </p><p> BELL:  But is that true though because you are immediately seeing impact to  steel prices, pork prices, soybean prices. So that is impacting the farmers  in the Midwest. But then when does it creep into sentiment numbers for the  consumer for businesses.  I know small business sentiment was at a new high  in the most recent reading.  So I feel like once it creeps into those  numbers you could really start to see an economic impact.  </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I think you're exactly right.  If you look at -- you do  have market moves.  You have volatility.  The question is does that feed  into the actual economic data.  The earliest read of that I think would be  a small business survey which has come off a little from the highs but it's  still very elevated.</p><p> So I don't think the market volatility has bled through into the economic  outlook.  And I think the story really is going back to the inflation  story.  I mean we had that shock early February with the jobs report, the  average hourly earnings number.  I think that's set off a re-pricing in the  bond market which bled through into equities.</p><p> So it's really for me the inflation story that's driving everything here,  and I think today -- </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  We get the CPI today.  The core is expected to be 2.1 percent  by Bloomberg's latest survey.  That's the first time, it is ever 2 percent  in a handful of months at least.  I'm not exactly sure what's your take on  that if we get that more than 2 percent number.  </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Yes.  I mean I don't want to make too much of it.  This is not  the 1970s.  This is stagflation or anything like that.  I do think 2.1  percent -- that 2 percent is a real critical threshold for the bond market  because the 2 percent is the number that the Fed is targeting.  So if, you  know, the bond market has been complacent for months because inflation was  low, it was sub 2 percent, you suddenly get above 2 percent, just  psychologically, I think that changes the game.</p><p> And then people start looking around.  You know, how it works, looking  around they start seeing inflation everywhere.  So they're going to start  seeing it in the aluminum prices, in oil prices.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, they're going to see it at the pump this summer.</p><p> CLEVELAND:  Exactly -- gasoline prices.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that changes sentiment because again, that's one inflation  gauge that people relate to from East Coast to West Coast.  </p><p> BELL:  It's the consumers wall -- Jamie Dimon has been really warning about  the potential for higher inflation going forward too, to this.  Maybe it  could be just the beginning.</p><p> We are getting into earnings season and a lot of the bulls are hanging  their hat on earnings really being what is going to calm this market.  Do  you believe that we'll get a look at the fundamentals?</p><p> CLEVELAND:  You know, I think near-term I do worry that the inflation story  will surprise the market.  We will get another repricing in interest rates  that will have a knock-on effect on the equity market.  So there's a short  term.  So that's -- I think over the next three months, let's say.</p><p> Longer-term, what I'm worried about is -- and what I'm going to focus on is  do we continue to see the unemployment rate fall?  If the unemployment rate  falls below 4 percent I think that is good for the consumer, I think that's  good for earnings.  </p><p> So it's really that story that I think over the, you know, the six to 12  month timeframe that will be more important.  And I think that will happen.   I think the unemployment rate falls below 4 percent in the next few months.   And that's fantastic.</p><p> We have only been that low on the unemployment rate three times in the  post-war era -- late 60s, late 90s for a few months, and the late 50s.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jeffrey -- good to see you.  Jeffrey Cleveland -- </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Nice to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Payden and Rygel.  Take care -- </p><p> CLEVELAND:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- and we will be watching again.  CPI out about a little more  than an hour from now.</p><p> Still ahead the immigration debate heating up -- why another California  town is joining the fight against sanctuary cities.</p><p> And the sky is the limit for the new airbus planes -- the wild features in  store for flyers, beds in the cargo hold.  Oh and playground slides.</p><p> That's ahead</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets  under pressure amid rising tensions with Syria.  President Trump warning  earlier this hour that missiles will be coming.  And you are seeing those  concerns show up in the stock market in the Futures.  We have a 257 point  loss on the Dow Futures.  That's -- they were down already about 175, 180  before Trump said that about Russia and Bashar al-Assad but again you see  the nervousness front center in the Futures.  The investors are also  waiting on inflation data, consumer prices, and the minutes from the  Federal Reserve latest meeting, You'll going to get that this afternoon.   This coming after a big rally yesterday.  420-point eight-point gain on the  Dow yesterday.  </p><p> China XI Jinping the President there said it was more open about trade,  opening up its economy.

But the  actor who is set to star as the late politician, I promise you it will  surprise you.  </p><p> Our top story this half hour, escalating tensions between the United States  and Russia.  The Trump administration rallying allies for a possible  military strike against the Assad regime.  But now Futures are extending  losses after President Trump's tweet earlier.  Here's what the President  said on Twitter.  'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia because they will be coming.  Nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.'  This coming after Moscow voted against a U.N.  resolution yesterday to investigate Saturday's suspected chemical attack  that killed dozens of people in Syria.  Joining me now is the member of the  House Committees on Judiciary and Foreign Affairs, Texas Congressman Ted  Poe.  Congressman Poe, your reactions to very strong words from the  President.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  Well, the President wants the Russians and really  the Syrians to know now where we stand on this issue.  Chemical weapons,  the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law.  The  Russians and the Syrians agreed a year or two ago to get rid of all of the  chemical weapons out of Syria.  They lied.  They're still there and they're  being used against the people of Syria.  There has to be consequences for  this violation of international law and the President is going to have a --  I suspect a targeted strike into Syria in retaliation for the use of  chemical weapons.  There are many options that's are available down the  road, most of them are not very good and the fact that I don't think most  Americans want a full military invasion of Syria.  I don't think that's  going to happen.  Targeted strike to get their attention is something that  I think the President's going to do and I support him in that.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK.  So, to your point, if the tweet is a directive, we are going  down the road of military action against Syria, there's almost no doubt  about it after the President's comments, Congressman this morning.  So  targeted strike to get their attention, once you have it, then what?   What's the goal?  </p><p> POE:  Well, the goal is to immediately have them quit using chemical  weapons.  Now, that has not worked in the past.  They went ahead and used  chemical weapons anyway.  So, there has to be some retaliation to the  Syrians and to the Russians and don't forget the Iranians.  The Iranians  are involved in all of this too, who've murdered their own people.  And  what that will be, I hope is something that will cease and desist on the  use of chemical weapons in the Civil War in Syria.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, how big is the --</p><p> POE:  The United States is not going -- the United States is not going to  topple the regime, remove Assad.  That's not going to happen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Despite the air -- the strike on that air base, that airfield  last year, there's a lot that the United States has not done to really go  after Bashar al-Assad.  I'll point to a chlorine gas attack earlier this  year, killed more than 20 people, mostly children and that warranted what  was essentially a statement from Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state,  that was saying that it was no denying that Russia by shielding its Syrian  ally has breached its commitment to the United States as a framework  guarantor, this is about the U.N. deal some years ago brokered by the Obama  administration.  </p><p> But again, we didn't strike.  And Bashar al-Assad read that as quite  frankly, weakness and that he would pay no price.  We've also did not stop  Iran from establishing a new military presence on the border with Israel in  Syria.  So, how big does this message need to be?  Do we need to take out  the entire air force of Bashar al-Assad?  </p><p> POE:  What we do really, I think is something that the military and the  President need to decide.  But it has to be strong enough to keep the  Russians, the Iranians and the Syrians from using chemical weapons on their  own people.  And that it has to be the message that we send to them.  Assad  is I think going to stay in power.  It's not our plan to remove him.  I do  not see the United States using a full military invasion of Syria, but I  think a strike will be strong enough to say look, you have to cease and  desist.  The Russians and the Iranians and the Syrians, they cannot be  trusted.  They are using this as a proxy war to really influence, have  their own Russian and Iranian influence in Syria with Assad as their  puppet.  But that needs to be strong.  And I think it will be strong when  the President decides what exactly to do in military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now, do they heat the sanctuary show down, another  California City voting overnight to join the Justice Department law suit.   Challenging the so-called sanctuary state law.  Watch as residents in  Orange County take a bold stance against the policy limiting cooperation  between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT:  Anybody for (INAUDIBLE) doesn't realize we're  talking about criminals here, not refugees, not immigrants, criminals.   We're going to deport them and that's just too bad if you don't like it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Members of the National Guard in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas  have already begun arriving at the southern border.  The California has not  yet complied with President Trump's request.  Congressman, your thoughts on  this? </p><p> POE:  It's a smart move on the part of the President to put the National  Guard on the border.  I'm from Texas.  And we had the National Guard down  there a few years ago.  And it worked.  It stopped people from crossing  into the United States.  So, I totally support that idea because it's  something that has worked in the past.  Now, one thing that we need to do  as a nation is remember, we have to protect the border and the border is  the middle of the Rio Grande River.  </p><p> And once people cross that middle and come into the United States, they're  already in the United States.  So, our philosophy needs to be keep people  from crossing.  Therefore, we need boats in the water, down the middle of  the Rio Grande River and we also need the aerostats, cameras and those kind  of things to prevent people from crossing in the first place.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know.  We are showing a graphic that says border  apprehensions in March did surge, up more than 200 percent year over year  but they had been dramatically falling since the year 2000, in fact.  I  believe last year they were at the lowest level since 1971.  So, the action  by this administration is in response to those apprehensions going up in  recent months.  I want to get your reaction, Congressman, President Trump  is quite busy this morning, just tweeting this about Russia.  \"Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been.  And that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together.  Stop the arms race.\"  </p><p> Congressman, your reaction to that?  Because again, this President more  than any other has been attacked by people on the left, people in the media  for being light on Russia, again pushing that narrative of collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia and his actions and words have both  been incredibly strong at laying down what he feels about Russia, Russia  interference and Russian aggression.  </p><p> POE:  Well, there are people in the media who are obsessed with hating on  Trump and they will use anything they can to do so.  And Russia is one of  the examples.  Look at the big picture.  The President has been tough on  Russia and he's going to continue to be tough on Russia because Russia is a  bully.  They lie about their foreign policy.  They have invaded crime  media, they have invaded Eastern Ukraine, they have invaded Georgia with no  consequences.  And they're going to continue.  </p><p> I think Putin is going to continue when he finds an opportunity to move  into somebody else's country and try to put troops there.  The President of  the United States recognizes that, and we need to -- and he sees the  importance of making sure that Russia is not an aggressor nation like it  wants to be.  In his talk is tough and also his actions are tough of  removing spies from the United States, sending them back home where they  belong.  And I think it is a new day in the relationship with Russia is  that we need to get tough on Russia.  But Russia needs to work with the  west and they refuse to do so.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I think, one thing that did not get enough attention were  the sanctions on Putin's rich cronies and their ability to do business  sanctions on their assets, lending their ability to do business.  That hits  somewhere it hurts and ultimately that might change Putin's behavior.  But  again, not much coverage of what the Treasury Department did last week.   Congressman, it's good to see you.  Congressman Poe from Texas.  Take care.  </p><p> POE:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a cheap repair could cost you in the long run.  Why  iPhone owners may want to think twice before using a third party to fix a  broken screen.  And Hollywood taking Toronto, the unexpected choice set to  play controversial ex-mayor Rob Ford in an upcoming movie.  He looks more  like Connell McShane.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  What?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a hint.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets under pressure this morning amid rising tensions with  Russia and Syria.  The President Trump has been tweeting this hour about  this relationship and about Syria and here's what he had to say.  'Our  relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that  includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to  help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we  need all nations to work together to stop the arms race.'  Earlier this  hour he said 'Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  </p><p> Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming.  Nice and new and, \"smart\".   You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.'  What has been the reaction in the markets?  Futures  are lower, 230-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, but loss is kind of  equal losses on all three major market gauges in the Futures market so far  this morning.  And that selling is picking up steam because of those  tweets.  Meantime, Apple loses a major patent infringement case.  Cheryl  Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes Dagen, another stock to watch today as  well.  Shares of VirnetX surging since the Federal Jury in Texas said that  Apple must pay that security software company $500 million over infringed  patents.  And the Jury ruled that Apple's FaceTime, its VPN and its Demand  on iMessage features infringe four of VirnetX patents.  The imagers based  on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices.  This is a big one.   Meanwhile, there is more iPhone problems to tell you about.  A new update  disables iPhone eight devices that have screens that were at some point  repaired by a third party.  The update renders the touch screen useless.   The only option, you have to replace the screen again and Apple has to do  it.  A similar problem happened with the iPhone seven.  That was fixed,  though.  Anyway, another stock to watch going to be Apple today.  It's  slightly lower in the premarket.  </p><p> OK, here's something for you.  Especially if you fly a lot, Airbus may have  come up with the next big thing in travel on long range flights.  Bunk beds  in the cargo hold.  You're looking at the rendering of this idea.  They  plan to include this on the A330 and A350 jets by 2020.  Airbus is also  looking at offering a children's play area, complete with a playground, a  slide, and even hospital rooms on-board.  Passengers (INAUDIBLE) passengers  would have to be buckled in and seated during take-off and landing.  Shares  of Airbus are up more than 15 percent.  I said this on \"FBN:AM\" this  morning Dagen (INAUDIBLE) the story that basically, I don't know, they'll  put the play room and the beds side-by-side.  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Don't play in the streets.  Play in a \"sleeping berth\" which  they haven't cleaned for the last 80 flights (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> CASONE:  I'm hoping they clean them.  I'm hoping they clean them.  OK  really quick one more.  Billion-star Damian Lewis reportedly set to play  Toronto's controversial former mayor Rob Ford in a new movie.  Hollywood  reporter is saying that the 47-year-old British actor has been cast to play  the mayor.  The movie is going to be called \"Run This Town\".  Remember Ford  died from cancer back in 2016.  But he made international headlines 2013  when a cell phone video showed him smoking crack cocaine.  Dagen, here's  the thing, Damian Lewis is a really small guy, I mean, he's a slight guy,  he's a good-looking guy but he's a thin man.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We call him \"Billions\", he was on \"Homeland\".  I was trying to  say that the guy cast to play Rob Ford looks more like Connell than Rob  Ford.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, I was wondering about that.  I was wondering who's it going  to be actually.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the tease.</p><p> MCSHANE: (INAUDIBLE) it could be a lot worse speaking Dagen's past  pronounced. With it could be a lot worse. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, and I -- He's a fine actor.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  He is a good actor.  He's a very good actor.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can he play Rob Ford?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I don't know if anyone can play Rob Ford.  We miss -- we miss old  Rob Ford.  He was -- he was an original.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know who could play Rob Ford?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Who?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris Farley.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, it's not going to happen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, may he rest in peace.</p><p> MCSHANE:  It's not going to happen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have to get you to watch \"Billions\".</p><p> ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  I love \"Billions\".  I got to get you to watch  \"Billions\".</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I do, it's on my list.</p><p> JAIN:  Catch up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On Showtime.  We'll be right back, everybody.  Coming up next,  shedding your winter skin, the health issues behind the viral new trend  dubbed Snake Diet.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Favorite story of the day.  Can eating like a snake help you  lose weight?  There is a new fad diet called the Snake Diet.  Participants  drink nothing but apple cider vinegar with mineral replacements for two  days and then go on a flexible fasting routine.  The diet founder claims  say it is similar to how snakes eat.  The critics of the diet claim it is  dangerous and will not produce long-term results.  Joining me now is Doctor  Mikhail Varshavski.  Better known as Doctor Mike.  Tell us what you think  about this.  </p><p> MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, FAMILY MEDICINE:  I will say this, at the  outset right away, this is not a healthy diet.  This is not going to give  you any kind of results.  It's probably going to be dangerous for your  health and the person who created this diet, his name is Cole Robinson,  actually has a video on Youtube where he talks about it.  It's borderline  psychopath behavior.  He's calling people fatties.  He's screaming about  how you're supposed to eat like a snake and it's in our nature.  He makes  wild claims that it's going to cure type two diabetes, inflammation,  herpes.  </p><p> None of this is substantiated by science.  And I'm so passionate about  this, I just gave it, had talked about six months ago on this type of  experts.  They're IKA experts, I know all.  They think they understand  everything there is to know about science research and doctors don't know  what they're doing.  When in reality what they do is they take fringe  scientific research, weak scientific research, combine it and pull it  together and think that they've created the next new magical fact.  And  this is an example of it, the Snake Diet which is just complete, complete  garbage.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I call it, you know, it's not attention seeking behavior, I call  them attention seeking dolts, ASD.  But by the way, let me just clear  something up.  Because I, I'm a reptile freak.  A snake, like a six-foot  diamond carpet python eats once every two weeks, it drinks water and it  will eat one medium size rat.  It should be dead and frozen and then  thawed.  Otherwise the rat might bite the snake.  But it eats one rat every  two weeks. </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK, that's not a diet for anybody but --  </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Look, this gentleman basically claims that prolonged fasting  will help you lose weight.  Yes, eating less will help you lose weight.   But you don't need to do it so drastically.  Because number one, you won't  stick with such a crazy, strict diet.  People who have comorbidities or  other illnesses like diabetes or heart failure if they follow his dry  fasting or salt water fasting routine.  They'll overload the fluid --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here's the problem, no, here's the problem, if you starve me and  tell me to fast, I'm not going to act like a snake.  I will turn into a  fire-breathing dragon.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's kind of weird.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And what, I'm sitting -- I get really irritable.  Hungry.   Hungry.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You got to hold and knock this guy?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Tell me one snake you know that has herpes.  I have to be honest  with you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  I can't argue that.  I can't argue that as a doctor.  I don't  know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what?  Snakes do get mites.  They're specific to  snakes, snake mite.  And they're very hard to get rid of.  Dr. Mike, love  you.  It's always great to see you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you so much, appreciate it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like it when you get upset because you're cool about it.   Ankur Jain you have to come back.  Good to see you my friend.</p><p> JAIN:  Great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman Cain is up next hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p> You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.  Shares seeing their biggest gain in  two years as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced that grilling on ca Capitol Hill  over everything from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal to possible  Russian election interference. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  When you add more rules that companies  need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently  just has the resources to go do and that might just be harder for a smaller  company getting started to be able to comply with.  There are real  challenges that we face around content and privacy.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If we're counting on Facebook to  regulate itself, we're going to fail.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he'll  testify before house lawmakers.  He kept his cool yesterday and didn't make  the face when asked stupid questions by those Senators that everybody at  home watching did.  Fox Business will bring you that live coverage starting  at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  Tragedy in Algeria, the details after a military  plane crashes, killing at least 250 people.

And talk about a royal snub, both President Trump  and former President Barack Obama will not be invite ted to the upcoming  royal wedding.  Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and  the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list.  Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p> HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p> CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p> CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p> BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p> BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p> REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p> I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p> There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p> The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p> That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p> CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p> Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p> Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p> And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p> CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p> BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p> CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p> CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p> CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p> CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p> CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p> CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p> CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p> The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p> CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p> CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p> And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p> Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p> And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p> REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p> SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p> NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p> DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p> CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p> MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p> MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p> CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p> So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p> So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p> And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p> I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p> CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p> MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p> CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p> CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p> CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not in the least.  But he got a big job done,  the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the  board of?  No, I don't think so.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's all over my head.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Sorry.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office?  We'll be right  back, everybody.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks all, Herman Cain.  Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I shall.  Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.  The  President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

If it weren't for double standards, I'm not sure Twitter would have much.   </p><p>      You know, when you look right now, it's not so much that they have sort of a COVID misinformation policy, which we saw this week when they took down tweets from Donald Trump Jr.  </p><p>      If you go on Twitter right now, you can see tweets up from Democratic Congressman Swalwell that says don't wear masks. You can go on Twitter right now, today, and see tweets from the WHO that says there's no real evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID.  </p><p>      So it's less about a misinformation policy, it appears, than an orange man bad policy. And it's playing fast and loose in arbitrary ways. And so I think some of the concerns you heard at that hearing yesterday are pretty well founded.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  I'm wondering what the solution is, though. A lot of people say, all right, if you're going to check conservatives on things that they're saying, you should check liberals on things that they're saying. Others say it's the Wild West, anyone can say whatever they want and, you know, reader, viewer beware.   </p><p>      What do you think?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  Yes, if you go back to the hearing yesterday, I think what was interesting there was bipartisan consensus, which is rare in this town, as you know --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  -- that a lot of these big tech companies are abusing dominant positions in the market. Not just participating in the free market, but taking advantage of a level of a playing field that has been skewed by government regulation, including section 230.   </p><p>      The interesting debate is, what do you do about it. I think the Democrats have their path forward. They want to break up big tech. They want to block mergers and they want to see less speech on the Internet.   </p><p>      What's interesting is, I think on the Republican side, and for conservatives, which is really a -- a -- part of a broader debate about what we do. There's some that say we should just sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing in the face of this abuse of massive power.  </p><p>      I think that we should do more than nothing. I've laid out a path forward where we can work towards transparency, accountability, and user empowerment that will make a lot of progress on these issues.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Do you worry, though, Commissioner, because then Democrats have their own beefs, as you know, with a lot of these guys, that they do very little -- did very little to explain and report on foreign election interference in our country, on -- that they're doing it all over again. That's a lot of things these guys supposedly have to do to police themselves.   </p><p>      Should they do that? In other words, whether it's offensive on the left or the right, that these are great public forums, whatever you make of them, and that the government getting involved in policing them will only make matters worse.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  Yes, I don't think that the government should step in, and we shouldn't step in at the FCC, and micro-manage these decisions. What we have is Congress passed this law, as you know, Section 230 in the 1990s. That gave a special set of protections to what's now big tech and all other websites.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  And the question is, how do we interpret that law today? Can we do it in a way that promotes more speech, not less speech?   </p><p>      Again, I don't want to be micro-managing these decisions. We shouldn't be trying to skew the speech right or left. But like every business in this country, there should be some transparency and accountability.   </p><p>      If you say voluntarily we are a neutral platform politically, for all the take-downs that we do, we don't do partisan political take-downs. And then if, in fact, you're doing that, you should be held accountable.  </p><p>      In fact, we do that with broadband Internet providers today. We make them be transparent about anything they do to mold traffic or discriminate against traffic. That should be the baseline at a minimum for big tech. Let's make them be transparent and hold them accountable to their representations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, thank you very much. Very good chatting with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  Thanks.   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-6DB1-F15W-H03B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

If it weren't for double standards, I'm not sure Twitter would have much.</p><p>You know, when you look right now, it's not so much that they have sort of a COVID misinformation policy, which we saw this week when they took down tweets from Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>If you go on Twitter right now, you can see tweets up from Democratic Congressman Swalwell that says don't wear masks. You can go on Twitter right now, today, and see tweets from the WHO that says there's no real evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID.</p><p>So it's less about a misinformation policy, it appears, than an orange man bad policy. And it's playing fast and loose in arbitrary ways. And so I think some of the concerns you heard at that hearing yesterday are pretty well founded.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm wondering what the solution is, though. A lot of people say, all right, if you're going to check conservatives on things that they're saying, you should check liberals on things that they're saying. Others say it's the Wild West, anyone can say whatever they want and, you know, reader, viewer beware.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>CARR:  Yes, if you go back to the hearing yesterday, I think what was interesting there was bipartisan consensus, which is rare in this town, as you know --</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>CARR:  -- that a lot of these big tech companies are abusing dominant positions in the market. Not just participating in the free market, but taking advantage of a level of a playing field that has been skewed by government regulation, including section 230.</p><p>The interesting debate is, what do you do about it. I think the Democrats have their path forward. They want to break up big tech. They want to block mergers and they want to see less speech on the Internet.</p><p>What's interesting is, I think on the Republican side, and for conservatives, which is really a -- a -- part of a broader debate about what we do. There's some that say we should just sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing in the face of this abuse of massive power.</p><p>I think that we should do more than nothing. I've laid out a path forward where we can work towards transparency, accountability, and user empowerment that will make a lot of progress on these issues.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you worry, though, Commissioner, because then Democrats have their own beefs, as you know, with a lot of these guys, that they do very little -- did very little to explain and report on foreign election interference in our country, on -- that they're doing it all over again. That's a lot of things these guys supposedly have to do to police themselves.</p><p>Should they do that? In other words, whether it's offensive on the left or the right, that these are great public forums, whatever you make of them, and that the government getting involved in policing them will only make matters worse.</p><p>CARR:  Yes, I don't think that the government should step in, and we shouldn't step in at the FCC, and micro-manage these decisions. What we have is Congress passed this law, as you know, Section 230 in the 1990s. That gave a special set of protections to what's now big tech and all other websites.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>CARR:  And the question is, how do we interpret that law today? Can we do it in a way that promotes more speech, not less speech?</p><p>Again, I don't want to be micro-managing these decisions. We shouldn't be trying to skew the speech right or left. But like every business in this country, there should be some transparency and accountability.</p><p>If you say voluntarily we are a neutral platform politically, for all the take-downs that we do, we don't do partisan political take-downs. And then if, in fact, you're doing that, you should be held accountable.</p><p>In fact, we do that with broadband Internet providers today. We make them be transparent about anything they do to mold traffic or discriminate against traffic. That should be the baseline at a minimum for big tech. Let's make them be transparent and hold them accountable to their representations.</p><p>CAVUTO:  FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, thank you very much. Very good chatting with you.</p><p>CARR:  Thanks.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2428561610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-C8C1-JBHT-D1FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CQ Roll Call Jul 30, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman Ro Khanna, along with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. It is good to have you both with us. Thank you so much for being here. And Congressman Khanna, let me kick it off with you, tell me what you want to do here, in terms of rural jobs, across the country, created by tech?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  Well, I've been very pleased to partner with Governor Reynolds and the local stakeholders in Jefferson, Iowa. We have had a number of Silicon Valley companies offer scholarships with Des Moines Community College, and offer a pathway for folks to get trained in digital marketing, in software design and be able to get jobs.</p><p>And they are going to be able to stay in the communities they grew up in. I really believe that Jefferson, Iowa can be a model for the country, in showing how we can create a technology opportunity in rural America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you know, it's interesting because you've got technology taking us forward, certainly, making our live better in so many ways, but there's also that worry about privacy, right, Congressman? I mean, just today, we're talking all about facial recognition, for example, and you know, there are some colleagues on -- of yours, that are worried about things like ring.</p><p>The company that has that doorbell that you can see, you know, the camera. Amazon owns the doorbell camera company. It's facing questions from Senator Edward Markey, over its partnerships with police departments around the country and tracking citizens.</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, Maria, there's no doubt that technology can be abused. I have put forward an internet bill of rights to be able to protect people's privacy and to make sure that technology isn't misused in engaging in profiling or discrimination.</p><p>But I think the challenge of our time is to maximize the positives of technology to allow people access to jobs that are going to have a technical component while minimizing the harm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, where do you sit on this? Tell us the situation in Iowa and how technology companies could create opportunities there?</p><p>GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA):  Well, I'm really excited about the forge in this dynamic project and the opportunities that it provides for Iowans, especially in rural Iowa. I appreciate Congressman Ro Khanna and his involvement in really helping bring jobs to rural America. I want to give a shout out to Accenture for going beyond our urban centers and taking this model into rural Iowa.</p><p>We have a diverse in growing economy. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. And so, this is an opportunity not only to make sure that we are seeing that the success that Iowa is seeing, is happening all across our state and not just in pockets. And I believe with this model, it's an example that we can scale in rural communities all across Iowa and this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we have been talking all morning about the jobs report, we're going to get the numbers in 25 minutes, but one issue is that people need to be retrained, right? There's a real skills gap going on over there, throughout the country.</p><p>REYNOLDS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you want to say to people out there who, you know, maybe it's a -- you know, a construction worker, a truck driver, whatever, they don't know anything about coding. They don't know anything about some of this technology new, you know, million-dollar words that we're talking about. How are they going to thrive?</p><p>REYNOLDS:  Well, we want to make sure we start and have that pipeline in middle school and high school so that we are training our young people to be adaptive, to be lifelong learners, but we have a program in Iowa that we launched a couple years ago, and that we're really -- it's -- we're implementing it right now and it's called Future ReadyIowa.</p><p>And it has a goal of having 70 percent of Iowans, in the workforce, have either education or training beyond high school by the year 2025. We've put funding into that so that we can help not only with the pipeline for our K-12, but to work with our adult learners to provide that support system, to help them get the skills, to match them up with the jobs that we have available in the state right now.</p><p>These are great careers to help them be lifelong learners and the -- I believe, the hub, like the forge, is an opportunity to -- you know, to serve as a launchpad, to retrain, to help kids get the skills to fill the jobs, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's an important point.</p><p>REYNOLDS:  -- we're seeing this happen all over the state. Pardon?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I think it's an important point that you make about older workers, because, that's the group, white collar too, by the way, who are being left behind in some -- in some regard. Congressman Khanna, let me ask you about these antitrust investigations, the Texas attorney general set to lead an effort, looking into Google and digital advertising, this, according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>New York attorney general is also overseeing a review of Facebook and personal data concerns. These investigations could expand to other companies. What do you want to see in terms of regulation, on big tech, knowing that these companies are more powerful today than they've ever been?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think we, obviously, have to enforce antitrust law and make sure that these platforms are competitive, that they aren't privileging their own products, but we also need to make sure that we are innovative. America leads the world in innovation. Our technology is far superior to any tech company in Europe. And our real competition is China.</p><p>And so, I want to make sure that we have strong antitrust enforcement, but I also want to make sure that America leads the world in technology. And a quick point, I think you're absolutely right, Maria, that there are going to be jobs in all different industries, manufacturing, construction, logistics --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>KHANNA:  -- not everyone has to go become a coder, but everyone is going to need some technology skill --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KHANNA:  -- even in the industry that they may work in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's absolutely right. The skills training is really important at this moment in time. Does it bother you that Google has an A.I. lab in China? I mean, look, this China fight with the U.S., is getting deeper. Retail giant, Target, is telling suppliers ahead of the September 1st tariff hike, they'd have to pay for additional costs, not consumers. Beijing is (ph) also feeling the tariff pinch, a report from the Tokyo investment bank, Nomura, says that countries like Vietnam and South Korea are benefiting the most from the trade impasse.</p><p>And we know, Governor, that Google walked away from a contract with the Pentagon, Project Maven, and yet, it has an A.I. lab in China. Is there any reason to believe that China will try to dictate or meddle in the U.S. elections through Google?</p><p>REYNOLDS:  Is that to me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>REYNOLDS:  Oh, I'm sorry. OK. Well, listen, I think that's something that we need to be mindful of. We know that China has been a bad actor. We need to hold them accountable, and that's what we're trying to do. And so, it's important that we take this seriously, and that we, you know, stay firm in what we're trying to do through the negotiations of -- with China, but they have a history of being a bad actor.</p><p>They -- it's intellectual property and technology transfer is a cost of doing business. Our businesses are aware of that. And so, we need to hold them accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm just -- I'm just wondering about Google, Congressman Khanna, because, you know, you heard Peter Thiel's comments, right? I mean, Peter Thiel wrote an op-ed and he said it's a national security risk, that Google has an A.I. lab in China, what do you think about that? Any worries?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I agree with Governor Reynolds that China has been stealing intellectual property. There's no doubt about that. We need to protect our most sensitive technology from going to China.

It is good to have you both with us. Thank you so much for being here. And Congressman Khanna, let me kick it off with you, tell me what you want to do here, in terms of rural jobs, across the country, created by tech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA)</emphasis>:  Well, I've been very pleased to partner with Governor Reynolds and the local stakeholders in Jefferson, Iowa. We have had a number of Silicon Valley companies offer scholarships with Des Moines Community College, and offer a pathway for folks to get trained in digital marketing, in software design and be able to get jobs.  </p><p>      And they are going to be able to stay in the communities they grew up in. I really believe that Jefferson, Iowa can be a model for the country, in showing how we can create a technology opportunity in rural America.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, you know, it's interesting because you've got technology taking us forward, certainly, making our live better in so many ways, but there's also that worry about privacy, right, Congressman? I mean, just today, we're talking all about facial recognition, for example, and you know, there are some colleagues on -- of yours, that are worried about things like ring.  </p><p>      The company that has that doorbell that you can see, you know, the camera. Amazon owns the doorbell camera company. It's facing questions from Senator Edward Markey, over its partnerships with police departments around the country and tracking citizens.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, Maria, there's no doubt that technology can be abused. I have put forward an internet bill of rights to be able to protect people's privacy and to make sure that technology isn't misused in engaging in profiling or discrimination.  </p><p>      But I think the challenge of our time is to maximize the positives of technology to allow people access to jobs that are going to have a technical component while minimizing the harm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Governor, where do you sit on this? Tell us the situation in Iowa and how technology companies could create opportunities there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA)</emphasis>:  Well, I'm really excited about the forge in this dynamic project and the opportunities that it provides for Iowans, especially in rural Iowa. I appreciate Congressman Ro Khanna and his involvement in really helping bring jobs to rural America. I want to give a shout out to Accenture for going beyond our urban centers and taking this model into rural Iowa.  </p><p>      We have a diverse in growing economy. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. And so, this is an opportunity not only to make sure that we are seeing that the success that Iowa is seeing, is happening all across our state and not just in pockets. And I believe with this model, it's an example that we can scale in rural communities all across Iowa and this country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, we have been talking all morning about the jobs report, we're going to get the numbers in 25 minutes, but one issue is that people need to be retrained, right? There's a real skills gap going on over there, throughout the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, what do you want to say to people out there who, you know, maybe it's a -- you know, a construction worker, a truck driver, whatever, they don't know anything about coding. They don't know anything about some of this technology new, you know, million-dollar words that we're talking about. How are they going to thrive?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  Well, we want to make sure we start and have that pipeline in middle school and high school so that we are training our young people to be adaptive, to be lifelong learners, but we have a program in Iowa that we launched a couple years ago, and that we're really -- it's -- we're implementing it right now and it's called Future ReadyIowa.  </p><p>      And it has a goal of having 70 percent of Iowans, in the workforce, have either education or training beyond high school by the year 2025. We've put funding into that so that we can help not only with the pipeline for our K-12, but to work with our adult learners to provide that support system, to help them get the skills, to match them up with the jobs that we have available in the state right now.  </p><p>      These are great careers to help them be lifelong learners and the -- I believe, the hub, like the forge, is an opportunity to -- you know, to serve as a launchpad, to retrain, to help kids get the skills to fill the jobs, so --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I think it's an important point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  -- we're seeing this happen all over the state. Pardon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, I think it's an important point that you make about older workers, because, that's the group, white collar too, by the way, who are being left behind in some -- in some regard. Congressman Khanna, let me ask you about these antitrust investigations, the Texas attorney general set to lead an effort, looking into Google and digital advertising, this, according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p>New York attorney general is also overseeing a review of Facebook and personal data concerns. These investigations could expand to other companies. What do you want to see in terms of regulation, on big tech, knowing that these companies are more powerful today than they've ever been?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think we, obviously, have to enforce antitrust law and make sure that these platforms are competitive, that they aren't privileging their own products, but we also need to make sure that we are innovative. America leads the world in innovation. Our technology is far superior to any tech company in Europe. And our real competition is China.  </p><p>      And so, I want to make sure that we have strong antitrust enforcement, but I also want to make sure that America leads the world in technology. And a quick point, I think you're absolutely right, Maria, that there are going to be jobs in all different industries, manufacturing, construction, logistics --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  -- not everyone has to go become a coder, but everyone is going to need some technology skill --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  -- even in the industry that they may work in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, that's absolutely right. The skills training is really important at this moment in time. Does it bother you that Google has an A.I. lab in China? I mean, look, this China fight with the U.S., is getting deeper. Retail giant, Target, is telling suppliers ahead of the September 1st tariff hike, they'd have to pay for additional costs, not consumers. Beijing is (ph) also feeling the tariff pinch, a report from the Tokyo investment bank, Nomura, says that countries like Vietnam and South Korea are benefiting the most from the trade impasse.  </p><p>      And we know, Governor, that Google walked away from a contract with the Pentagon, Project Maven, and yet, it has an A.I. lab in China. Is there any reason to believe that China will try to dictate or meddle in the U.S. elections through Google?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  Is that to me?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  Oh, I'm sorry. OK. Well, listen, I think that's something that we need to be mindful of. We know that China has been a bad actor. We need to hold them accountable, and that's what we're trying to do. And so, it's important that we take this seriously, and that we, you know, stay firm in what we're trying to do through the negotiations of -- with China, but they have a history of being a bad actor.  </p><p>      They -- it's intellectual property and technology transfer is a cost of doing business. Our businesses are aware of that. And so, we need to hold them accountable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I'm just -- I'm just wondering about Google, Congressman Khanna, because, you know, you heard Peter Thiel's comments, right? I mean, Peter Thiel wrote an op-ed and he said it's a national security risk, that Google has an A.I. lab in China, what do you think about that? Any worries?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I agree with Governor Reynolds that China has been stealing intellectual property. There's no doubt about that. We need to protect our most sensitive technology from going to China. I don't think we ought to allow China, access, to our most sensitive technology.  </p><p>      What we also need to do, as a country, is invest in the technologies of the future, Artificial Intelligence, quantum computing --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Are we doing enough of that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  -- and make sure America leads --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  -- in the industries of the future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You're right, especially as China wants to be number one in all of those industries, so you wonder if we are, in fact, doing enough. It's great to have this conversation with you both, and it's great to see you both working together on this very important project. Thank you, Congressman Ro Khanna and Governor Kim Reynolds, good to see you both.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REYNOLDS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0G-S4X1-F15W-H0J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I'm Lauren Simonetti. Our Maria Bartiromo is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she is set to host a panel discussion with major market players including Bridgewater founder, Ray Dalio, and UBS Chairman, Axel Weber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's listen in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED: ... going to recession. So it doesn't look to me like that's taking place, I think Marcus (ph), you're overreacting to short-term sentiment around a whole bunch of complex issues.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Head spinning moves and uncertainty gripped globe last year with expectations of synchronized growth changing to expectations of a synchronized slowdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The stock market rocked with wild moves up and down. But sadly, for investors, it's been more down than up.</p><p>In Europe, Brexit on the brink.</p><p>MAY: I continue to believe that we can leave with a good deal and this is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Paris in pieces. Citizens rioting over a gas tax designed to curb carbon emissions. All this as America's economy is humming in ways not seen in years. The president's tax plan kicking in January 1, helping to send second quarter GDP north of four percent and the unemployment rate all the way down to 3.7 percent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED: The fact that a business can write off 100 percent of an investment is an enormous incentive to get people to make capital investment and that capital investment creates more jobs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED: Look how our workers having their best increase in many, many years. The American economy is crushing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the euphoria faded by midyear as the president's America first policy meant renegotiating old trade deals. President Trump telling me in April that the United States will not back down until it has better terms with the rest of the world, notably China.</p><p>Are we going to back down on tariffs against China?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no, no, no. No. China wants to make a deal. And so what? But it's got to be fair deal for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The administration calling out China over IP theft, the forced transfer of technology, spying on Americans, and lopsided protectionist tariffs. But while doing so, global growth worries persisted.</p><p>President Trump also calling out his federal reserve chairman for raising interest rates.</p><p>TRUMP: I think that is making a mistake, so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: High rates and the China tensions roiling the equity markets by year's end with a big hit in the fourth quarter. The business world also still roiled by the Me Too Movement including media mogul, Les Moonves, of CBS, fired and deprived of a massive severance package after an investigation uncovered years of alleged sexual harassment.</p><p>It was also a year of big challenges for big tech.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, it was my mistake and I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed that Cambridge Analytica took the personal data of millions of people's Facebook without their consent and it was used for political purposes. Facebook stock taking a beating and others such as Google, under the microscope for privacy issues leading to calls for tighter regulations.</p><p>Two thousand and eighteen saw a big change for the Internet, that very few noticed. Net neutrality was repealed by Trump administration despite promises of doom, the Internet seems to work the same as before.</p><p>But it is not the same as before for believers of bitcoin. A year ago, the cryptocurrency riding high near $20,000 but by yearend, crashing below $5,000.</p><p>The yearend midterm election set the tone for the year ahead with new uncertainty with the Democrats in the majority in the House, creating new questions over what can get done legislatively.</p><p>TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Two thousand and nineteen begins with a new Congress and a divided government. That, traditionally, has been good for business and the stock market but the U.S. will need to ratify the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as come up with a new healthcare plan.</p><p>And in this year of a nontraditional president where business and politics overlap, you can be sure that more surprises are in store for 2019.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we have a wonderful panel to address all of the above, in particular, the Global Expansion. Joining us right here on stage is Fang Xinghai, he is the Vice Chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission, the People's Republic of China.</p><p>With us this morning is Jin Keyu, Professor of Economics, London School of Economics; Ray Dalio is the Founder, Chairman, and Co-Chief Investment Officer at Bridgewater AssociatesUSA; and Axel Weber is the Chairman of UBS. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us.</p><p>Dr. Fang, let me kick it off with you. Given the prominence and implications and impact that China has on the world, how can you assess, the global storage day. How would you say China is doing economically speaking?</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION: I think it's certain that the Chinese economy will slow down a little bit this year and that's because of trade, because of slowing down of the real estate market which is very much needed, by the way.</p><p>But slowing down in China is not a collapse, right? So last year, we grew at 6.6 percent, this year, perhaps something around six percent, let's say. And six percent is not very slow pace.</p><p>Now, the Chinese macro policies are very data dependent, I put it this way. So at this point, the government has already readied ph quite a set ph strong of fiscal policy as well as monetary policy.</p><p>But if things continue to challenging going forward, on the fiscal side, there's a lot room to expand. Some people worry about the overall debt in China. I think that, to the corporate sector, is a little bit too high. But the government sector can still leverage a lot and you're already seeing the local government issuing more of what we call project bond, the central government hasn't done so.</p><p>The ability for the central government to borrow more is also very large. So the bottom line is that China is slowing down but it's not going to be a disaster.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What areas would you say are seeing the most slowdown? I mean, because you make such an important point. It was the slowest pace of growth, in three decades in 2018, and yet, country on the globe would love to say it is growing 6 percent. So can you identify the specific industries that you believe are actually leading that slowdown?</p><p>FANG: Well, export is, one example. The data from December, for exports, was not very encouraging. And we will see.</p><p>I mean, maybe it's a response to the trade dispute with the United States. It could be also an indication of global slowing down and we will see how this will unfold.</p><p>On the consumption side, last year, actually did quite well. But then, I mentioned, the real estate market because housing prices are perhaps too high, and that squeezed a lot of money out of households, squeezed consumption, right? So we need to do a lot about housing.</p><p>And infrastructure is another area because a lot of infrastructures were done China by local governments. And during the last few years, China has tightened up the implicit debt that local governments could borrow but we've expanded the explicit debt that the local government can borrow.</p><p>So there's a room there. We will see how the slowdown of infrastructure spending is dealt with this year. But again, the Chinese macro policy is very, I would say, it's very responsive and also is data dependent.</p><p>So as things unfold, we will respond accordingly and the capacity for the Chinese government to respond to the economic slowdown is still very high. If anything, we should not overreact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ray Dalio, you have to allocate capital regardless of the environment as the backdrop and you've been doing that for years very effectively. In fact, even just in 2018, you were up almost 15 percent in the face of all of what have we are talking about, increasing debt levels, global slowdown, and so many other things. Tell us how you see the backdrop and how you do allocate capital in this environment?</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER/CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: Well, let's say the backdrop, maybe I start with a template. I think over a period of time, there's productivity and the growth rate of productivity is the most important thing. You'll learn more, you invent more, you become more efficient and that rises.</p><p>Then we have cycles around that. We have a normal business cycles, short-term debt cycle and then there is a longer-term debt cycle which has to do with the capacity of leveraging up being limited when you approach zero interest rates or limitations in terms of the effectiveness of quantitative easing.</p><p>So that framework is what I use when I'm looking at China, when I'm looking at any country. I think we make bigger picture. I think we are in the later stages of the short-term debt cycle. Meaning, maybe within the seventh or eighth inning of that and that there was an inappropriate mistaken desire to tighten monetary policy at a level that was faster than the capital markets could handle.</p><p>And as a result, we had a correction. We had 70 basis points change in rates, we had an important change in Fed policy regarding what the direction of Fed policy will be in that tightening. But we're in the later stages of the cycle when asset prices are fully -- were fully priced and still are somewhat fully priced.</p><p>I think the key question, like when we look at each country, when we look at China, look at Europe, look at the United States, we will be in a slowing economic environment. That growth rate will slow and then probably in a self-reinforcing process.</p><p>I think -- but the question really is where the monetary policy is the nominated one-zone currency. These are all cycles. The cycle, like in China, I agree. It's one of those cycles people pay attention to but they have the power, the debt is in currency, they can handle that cycle.</p><p>But there is a weakening there. There is a slowing -- certainly a substandard growth rate in Europe and in the United States, there will be a significant slowing in that particular period which should warrant an easier monetary policy. The bigger issues, so these are the cycles and then there's constraints of monetary policy for being able to deal with that.</p><p>Then the bigger issues, really connected to politics and the economic policies associated with that. For example, when we cut corporate taxes and we made interest rates low enough that it was attractive to borrow, to buy financial assets, particularly buy companies having mergers and conventions, that caused a lot of growth in corporate debt and that growth in corporate debt was used to finance those purchases which supported the financial markets.</p><p>So that is going to be less. So I think that probably next year, the slow up and then the beginning of thinking about politics and what that might affect economic policy beyond, something like the talk of the 70 percent income tax, for example, will play a greater role.</p><p>So I think that that's -- if I'm covering the world, U.S. and we live in a world economy, U.S., Europe, China, all of those will be experiencing a greater level of slowing, probably a greater level of disappointment. And I think, there's this reasonable chance that by the end of that, that that monetary policy and fiscal policy, they have to become easier relative to what is now discounted in the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you make such an important point. Because for a decade, we had such low interest rate, zero, and such easy monetary policy, not just in the United States but across the world as you see that being removed, it has to be disruptive, right?</p><p>And I think at the end of the year, markets were reacting to the unwind of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as much the raising of interest rates. So I ask you, do we even have the wiggle room, if you will, in terms of cutting rates, where they are?</p><p>DALIO: No. I think you could look at the level of interest rates and compare that to zero. And think about that times the duration of the assets and that is the power that you can have in having financial assets impacted by easing a monetary policy.</p><p>Then you have to ask yourself in terms of the balance sheets, how much can the balance sheets be increased, what would be purchased and so on. So we -- what scares me the most longer term is that we have limitations to monetary policy which is our most valuable tool. We have important limitations to the effectiveness that at the same time as we have greater political and social antagonism.</p><p>So the next downturn in the economy worries me the most. I think that there are a lot of parallels with the late 1930s. 1929 to '32, we had a debt crisis interest rates at zero. Then there was a lot of printing of money, purchases of financial assets drive financial asset prices higher. Creates also a polarity, a populism and an antagonism.</p><p>We also had then at that time the phenomenon of a rising power like China dealing with the conflict of an existing power. These types of political issues are now very connected to economic issues and policy. So I think that that's the character of the environment we're in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Weber, you ran the Bundesbank for a time. I want to get your take on central bank policy as well. We also want to get into your assessment of China.</p><p>In December, your firm announced you can in fact own a bank in China. You announced this in December. So we'll get back to that. But first, assess the story as you heard Ray discuss in terms of central banks and the ability to react to a slowdown at this juncture.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, SWISS INVESTMENT BANK: So Ray made the very important distinction between structure and business cycle and I think that's important. Structurally, interest rates in most of the western world as we bounce back from the financial crisis were very low for very long and markets have gotten used to that.</p><p>I think actually rates for at least for the better half of the last five years have been too low for the environment, for the economic environment we've been in. But, of course, Ray mentioned the other point that central banks waited very long time just keeping rates low because they were not gearing monetary policy towards the expected state of the economy and to the rebound of growth but they were in a kind of insurance policy where they wanted to mitigate any tail risk and therefore, kept rates longer just to eliminate tail risk to the economy.</p><p>And, of course, when they started lifting rates, they tightened rates in a late cycle stage. So the impact of that is that if you look at monetary policy easing, which is if you look at the room to maneuver, the only central bank that has any room to maneuver is actually the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If you look at traditional policy moves by the Fed, they lower rates very frequently at relatively large steps of 50 basis point. The Fed can do a number of interest rate steps down if need be. So I'm not worried about room to maneuver short term but as Ray also said, given that we've had so low rates for long, the market hasn't really priced in much higher rates. If anything, the Fed has come towards neutral. They're not quite as neutral but they're close to it.</p><p>And so, going back down is an emergency measure they can take. But I think it's more likely if you look at the year ahead that they're on pause now. I think we're going through a soft spot in the economy. Numbers have weakened, both in emerging markets and in developed markets over the (inaudible) and the first quarter.</p><p>We'll probably see a soft spot continuing into the first quarter of this year. And then after the middle of the year, we have some hope that that stuff might be behind us. And that's not the point where monetary policy moves from tightening to easing. That's the point where monetary policy takes a pause where they become data dependent, where they move into wait-and-see attitude.</p><p>I still have penciled in one or two rate hikes by the Fed over this year. But I think they'll take a pause now. They'll look at the data and if and when they resume, in my view, it won't be before midyear, and then I think the rest really very much depends on how the current conflicts that we haven't yet talked about, the tail risk like the trade war and some of the other tail risks, Brexit, how that affects the globe economy, what spillback is back into the U.S. and how monetary policy should react to that in the United States.</p><p>So I think central banks are on hold. The downside of central banks being on hold is the ECH will never even leave negative territory if they don't start raising rates this year. We still think there is some expectation that towards the end of the year they might do a 25 -- 20 basis basis point rate hike. But the chances with European data also coming in weaker. French data are looking weaker. German data are looking weaker. Eurozone doesn't look very strong.</p><p>The expectation is still more likely to postpone that into next year. So I think, in general, monetary policy normalization is not an issue for this cycle. It's for the next cycle. They won't get it done this time because the economy is weakening. And so, I think it will be mission aborted.</p><p>They will look at normalizing rates in the next cycle and they react to a slowing economy over the next year or two by a more muted and more cautious, more data-driven approach.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Should the Fed slow down on the unwind? $50 billion a month is what the fed had signaled in terms of selling securities.</p><p>WEBER: I think the unwind is less of an issue in the United States than it is in other constituencies because structurally, the Fed used to have a balance sheet that was around 750 billion.</p><p>Long term, I don't think the Fed will go back to its old size of the balance sheet. The central bank's balance sheets would be a much more central part of financial markets and they'd be a multiple of what we saw in central bank balance sheets then/</p><p>I think what the Fed needs to do is really look at sort of is that different role that central banks now have in global economy where markets are looking very much for monetary policy as very often the only game in town, is that the position central banks want to be in?</p><p>Our Chinese friend just said the right thing, if you look at macro policies, monetary policy can react quickly because it's done by committee of elected bureaucrats. The real bigger impact you get from fiscal policy, it reacts slower, it needs to go through parliament, decision likes are longer, but it's much more impactful.</p><p>And then the structural policies, don't forget the supply side. China is, at the moment, reacting with this demand side measures both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling. But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in open market. That creates a lot of growth potential. That creates productivity enhancements. And so, along what Ray said, we're too focused on managing demand and managing sort of cyclical movement. We should be lot more focused on longer term structural issues in getting those right because I think the other stuff is very much a distraction.</p><p>You can't spend time and money to cushion the economy against the downturn. But it's much better to enhance the growth potential of the economies so that the downturn doesn't really need to such a big reset every time it happens and it happens time and again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's stay on this point for a moment in terms of China and the structural changes that we're seeing and the impact on the rest of the world. Keyu, your thoughts.</p><p>KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LSE: Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb. So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>So if we look at the kind of deleveraging, the different sectors, financial sectors deleveraging has been successful. Most of the debt to assets have stabilized. Household debt is increasing but household debt was very low and one can argue too low for a while in China.</p><p>So these efforts have made China financially much safer. And as a consequence, there will be a slowdown in economic growth, part of it is, of course, kind of triggered by external factors. But much of this is the deliberate effort of the government to slow down the credit growth, et cetera.</p><p>Now, of course, growth has now become more of an issue that the government is always treading between -- the line between financial risk and economic growth and now, they're shifting their focus more on revamping the growth.</p><p>And as Dr. Fang has mentioned, China has a whole set -- the Chinese government has a whole set of tools that are not normally available to other economies whether it's the massive assets on the government balance sheet or the huge amount of savings in China or just the simply coordination, coordination of different state-owned banks and state-owned local governments. All these things matter.</p><p>That said, despite the fact that there are a lot of instruments to work with, I think China's main challenge is really how to unleash the real potential of the real economy. Right now, monetary policy is expanding. You're injecting more liquidity. You're pushing for proactive fiscal policy and reducing taxes.</p><p>But the credit gets stuck in the financial sector. If it actually goes into the real economy, we are confident that their real big forces of positive changes for Chinese economy whether it's entrepreneurship, it's innovation, the fact that services are rising, service productivity is rising, urbanization.</p><p>But the trouble is really the financial system and how to match the investment and savers and also give the household more ability to consume, right? If you're -- if the real interest rate on bank deposits, which most of the savings is stuck, is earning zero in the last 10 years or 20 years while the economy is growing at six to eight percent, you're not giving that potential to the household and to the private sector. So it's all about unleashing the latent dynamism in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think the opening up of markets, do you think this trade issue with the United States will in fact impact the real economy in China?</p><p>JIN: I think that trade war has come as a benefit in disguise because it is serving as the external pressure for China to undertake some of these really important reforms. And as Axel has mentioned, financial services has opened up where it's really kind of on schedule to open up vastly.</p><p>Consumers are now able to purchase many more goods from the U.S. and from the rest of the world. China needs competition. So the financial sector needs competition. It needs to be injected with new blood and it is such things that will help with that.</p><p>So opening up in general, which is consistent, with China's longer-term goals, is simply accelerated by the recent trade war.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Fang, do you want to say something?</p><p>XINGHAI: Yes. Yes. Dr. Weber had a very good point and that is as China right now seems to focus on macro demand management, the supply side policy has not been stopped. We continued to push forward for supply side well because of supply-side structural reform.</p><p>And I'll give you a few examples. Opening up the financial sector for more international competition is one example and Dr. Weber can state (ph) to that. In the manufacturing sector, BASF recently was given the opportunity to establish a 100 percent-owned massive petrochemical plant in China.</p><p>They used to be a 50/50 JV requirement and now this requirement is gone. China has reduced input duty in a very substantial way. So there's more competition in the consumer market.</p><p>So the supply-side policy continued and that's very important point. And just to this audience, I want to say another word that is -- that China's vision for the economy is to make it open and large and competitive. So it's not only an opportunity for the Chinese companies but it would also be a huge opportunity for all the companies from the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Ray, you've been in China for 30 years. You've been visiting there for 30 years. Axel, your firm just announced you now own a financial institution that you own 51 percent of, is that right?</p><p>WEBER: Yes. We were the first bank that was offered a 51 percent stake in a joint venture and we've executed that in December and we now are the majority owner. We already had management control and we're now free to increase that stake further.</p><p>I think eventually as we invest in China and since our major partners are the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, there's likely going to happen some delusion of our partners. And we're looking into ways of raising capital also locally.</p><p>So there is welcome discussion between the Chinese authorities, much as with Hong Kong on the Shanghai-Hong Kong Bond Connect. But also, there was an ongoing discussion with London. I know that Dr. Fang is talking to the Swiss authorities.</p><p>So the more we can connect stock markets, the more we can actually be super connectors as international financial institutions to bring international investors into the Chinese economy and help Chinese investors invest in the rest of the world.</p><p>And it's absolutely right what our Chinese colleagues have said, the Chinese economy needs competition and they're working, I think, on three legs of that. First is state-owned enterprise reform and I think that is very important and we've all gone through that in Europe in the '90s of having former official sector conglomerates move to the private sector.</p><p>The second one is competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises in China. And the third one is, and the authority so far has been more cautious, opening up the Chinese economy for international competition because that will really be a major contribution to increasing the competitiveness of companies.</p><p>And, of course, we as international experienced investors can help in that process and actually can help both Chinese investors internationally and international investors in China.</p><p>Just to give you an example, banks like UBS, we have 24 percent share on the northbound traffic of the Asia market in the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect. So, we're kind of the go-to bank for a quarter of the investors into mainland China internationally.</p><p>Our market share for Chinese investors southbound (ph) is below 1 percent. We're not the go-to bank for international investments for Chinese citizens. And as we're granted majority rights as we're investing in our business, we just doubled our headcount in China over the last few years. We will become a major go-to partner also for Chinese investors in the global economy, but that will happen at a more measured pace because there is some concern in China that this will impact on the exchange rate. So the opening-up process is more controlled, but it's happening.</p><p>Don't mistake speed for direction. The direction is very clear. The speed, I think, has been really sort of increased recently. Actually, I was just in China in the first weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>WEBER: The constructive dialogues we had with Chinese authority is really on a totally different page today than it was a few years ago. So I'm very confident about this process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's not forget of top 20 banks in the world, the top five are Chinese.</p><p>Ray?</p><p>DALIO: Well, you mentioned I've been there 30 years and I've watched it evolved. And I think there are two types of things that are going on. Let's call them the short-term and the long-term, right?</p><p>As I said, productivity is the big thing in the long-term, and that's a real big thing. Then you have the short-term debt cycles and you have the short-term thing. So the two things that are happening short-term is that you are having deleveraging that you so articulately dealt with. There was an overleveraging and there was a development of the financial markets.</p><p>Not long ago, it was really five or six years ago, five major banks loaned money to state-owned enterprises and the money was clogged at the top. Then there was the development of the shadow banking system and the liberalization of that and now put into place regulation. Whenever you're having a deleveraging, that is something that makes the country healthier because you're deleveraging, but it has short-term effect, but it has a long-term positive. So there's the deleveraging happening. It's a short-term thing. And then there's the trade issues associated with that, which is also a short-term thing.</p><p>But if you take productivity growth, if you take the approach, I think it really has to be admired as Chinese characteristics as it's described. It's a cultural challenge for the West, but there's a top-down way of setting a mission for 2025 plan or a plan and working those things in the top-down way with unique resources available that has produced in the time that I've been there an increase of 20 times in incomes. It used to be the below poverty level. The 88 percent of the population was below poverty level. Today it's less than 1 percent.</p><p>There is an ability to produce productivity, but it's a culture clash with the West, in some ways, because as one of the leaders described it to me, the United States is a country of individualists. An individual is working that up. China is more of a country that is an extension of the model of the family. And he described, he said, \"There is the word 'country', in China, represents state family.\" And if you go back to Confucianism and how it is run top-down, and that is where there is an element of a culture clash.</p><p>At the same time, when you look at that productivity and the policies and things, it's a very effective place. So, I would say it's important to distinguish the short-term influences from longer-term productivity influences and then recognize that we're in a world where there is a competition and that could mean conflict in different dimensions between the two countries. That means, I think the trade issue is a manageable issue.</p><p>I think the way of being issue is a challenging issue because Americans can't expect Chinese to operate in a way that is different from that or vice versa. So I think that's the bigger long-term issue, but I think you'd have to be very optimistic when you think of even a 5 percent or a 6 percent growth rate and what that's going to mean and what the world will look like in 10 or 20 years. It will be quite a different world in which China is going to be, I think, a lot stronger. So I think that's the picture. Let's not confuse the short-term with that bigger picture, evolutionary picture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what about the picture of debt? I mean, how worried should we be about debt, particularly, the U.S. has to sell debt. China, obviously, one of the biggest, most significant holders of the US' debt. Are any of these issues, Dr. Fang, in terms of the trade spat, in terms of slowing growth in China are the biggest significant holders of the U.S. debt are any of these issues, in terms of the trade spat in terms of slowing growth in China, are they impacting capital flows?</p><p>XINGHAI: China will continue to be what we call a \"savings surplus country\" for some time, although the saving is declining, but it will be a saving surplus country. So we have to invest abroad. The U.S. government bond market turns out to be a good place to invest, so I don't think China will, in any way, significantly reduce its investment into the U.S. government bond market.</p><p>But on the other hand, in terms of capital flow, we do open up. We want more companies from different sectors to come into China, so that should increase capital inflows. We want to increase both way.</p><p>Maria, I want to add one point to what Ray Dalio just said about the culture shock, right? China does have different approach to economic management. And I think at this world, perhaps we should learn from each other a little bit. And I want to give you one example how we manage our financial risk.</p><p>Over the last 40 years, China hasn't had a very significant financial crisis, for example, and that's very rare among the developing world. And I used to work for the World Bank and we have financial crisis in developing countries a lot. And how China has been able to avoid financial crisis, right, in the last 40 years, well, we have a very top-down approach to financial risk management, and that is the a central government constantly is in touch with the financial sector, get information from the financial sector in a timely manner. And if there's any risk accumulating the system, the government will step in and order the risk to be reduced.</p><p>Now, of course, sometimes we will still miss something, right? So occasionally we have certain financial jitteries in the market. But once we have that financial jittery, our system is able to react to these jitteries in a very quick way, and we move quickly to contain the risk so that the risk does not spread into the entire system and it does not create panic in the system. And then as the economy grows the risk is diluted going forward, so that's how we have been able to grow our economy by so much and grow the financial system by so much without incurring a major financial risk. So there's some lesson there, I think, that the rest of the world perhaps should take a look at.</p><p>WEBER: I think, if I may, there's also a point of no return in this whole thing about opening up for China because you have to look at China's weight in the global economy has really increased massively. China is bordering on to at least 20 percent weight in the global economy. If you look at exports, if you look at global growth, still today, most of the growth that we see globally is generated by China's inclusion into world economy.</p><p>Now, that is reflected by now putting China a lot more into portfolios because you can't just have a big part of the global economy with Chinese, and investors completely haves zero exposure to that growth in their portfolio. So China gets inclusions into indices, like the MSCI, in the equity indices or in the bond indices like the Bloomberg Index. Our estimate is, over the next quarters, there will be 250 billion of capital inflows into China, basically just by this 4 percent weight that China will get.</p><p>Now, so far Ray is absolutely right, China debt is not a problem because it's largely domestically held. Domestic policies and redistribution of their debt can easily be engineered by policymakers.</p><p>International investors, if they invest in China debt or equity, they want different standards. They want accounting standards. They want very clear, solid products to invest in. So, what is happening is that will raise the standards and the bars for equity markets in China because you need to bring international investors in and you also need to allow, because you just don't want a big inflow into the Chinese economy that puts upward pressure on the exchange rate, you need to open up and sync international investments for your citizens to invest into rest of the world so you create capital outflows.</p><p>So in the future, the whole debate about QFII and QDII quotas will be a lot more interlinked because large banks like us who compete at the top level for Chinese clients will have to do both, only if our action is not just one-sided by bringing international capital in. But also having Chinese invest abroad, we will not have an impact in what we do on policy preferences like no impact on the exchange rate. So I think there is a point of no return where you simply once you open up, you get included in this index, you get drawn into the global economy, and that's where I think you really need to do the supply-side reforms to do that in a more resilient manner.</p><p>So, I'm not worried about the sort of credit cycling in China, at the moment, because the Chinese Central Bank can really create a lot more monetary stimulus without even touching interest rates. Reserve requirements are at -- 23 percent, I think, is the last number I saw. You can massively reduce reserve requirements for domestic banks and create credit origination without really doing anything, so the interest rate (inaudible).</p><p>XINGHAI: On this point of no return of opening up, the main reason is that is opening up is good for China.</p><p>WEBER: Sure.</p><p>XINGHAI: You mentioned the Asia inclusion into the MSCI Index, and the effect of that inclusion is already felt in the Chinese market in terms of raising the quality of the market because we now have to respond to the demand of the international institutional investors.</p><p>So just give you a very concrete example, in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we used to calculate the closing price of a stock by its last trade, and that's not very good for international investors. Now, according to their request, we have changed that into the average price of the last three minutes in a concentrated trading manner. And now it's much better according to the international investors. So this is just very small example of how opening up has been good for China, and we will continue to do that.</p><p>KEYU: I would like to push back on a little bit at this point. If we look back, maybe 200 years back, this century's financial history might well be written by China.</p><p>Now, it's not just a question whether China is ready or not for opening up, and here we're talking not just about opening up to trade, but opening up capital accounts and exchange rate flexibility. The question is, is the world ready?</p><p>Let us be reminded that China is still a developing country with a financial system with a whole array of issues. Because of the weight, it has an economy because even so far it hasn't opened up the financial linkages, but when it does, all of its volatility in China will transmit to the world in much greater proportions that we've seen. 2015, 2017, these were small movements in China and they sent jitters to the financial markets.</p><p>Now, imagine a really open Chinese market. The point behind this is should China not consider domestic financial reforms, sort its domestic issues first before thinking about really wide-scale opening up, in which case the financial linkages would be much stronger. So the world also needs to understand that the second largest economy in the world and the ones that's going to be transmitting the volatility is still a developing country. That's the first point.</p><p>The second is we've talked about how most of us agree that the debt problems in China are within management. I would say definitely the same, but it's really about how this debt is used and how this credit is used.</p><p>Since 2009, the RMB4 trillion fiscal stimulus has led to a gross misallocation of resources, so it's not so much the level of debt, the amount of credit in the economy, but where it is going. Is it just going to big SOEs, low-productivity firms, infrastructure projects or is this credit channeled to productive parts of the sector? Now, if a misallocation of resources can be reduced then there's enormous potential for China to continue to grow.</p><p>Lastly, I want to point to two facts that we've recently seen. For the first time in decades, in the first half of 2018, China is now importing more from the world than its exporting. It's running a current account deficit. That has huge implications.</p><p>Now two gentlemen on my left have talked about low interest rates, about challenges to monetary policy, both in Europe and the U.S. China will serve as a main source of aggregate demand where aggregate demand, as we have seen, is very lacking in the rest of the world. Inflation was not come up. Interest rates are still at record low levels. China will potentially be an important source of aggregate demand going forward now that it's importing more. So, pushing for a divorce with China is not necessarily a good idea.</p><p>XINGHAI: Keyu reminded me as a regulator of our responsibilities, right? Because as China draws more capital into its financial market, the jitteries inside China can have a huge impact in the international world. And we have raised our capabilities to do a better job.</p><p>DALIO: I think we also have to look at what's happening in light of the rises and declines of reserve currencies in the world and the normal patterns. And if you look at it, from the Dutch guilder, the British pound and the U.S. dollar, and now China and how countries evolve and you look at those patterns over a series of history, we know that, first of all, technology is the leading reason for the developments.</p><p>We know that each of those countries has to go global with their currency and their banks. We know that they have to be developed their financial markets. Every one of those has had a financial center. Amsterdam was, London was, New York was, and now in China, they must have their financial markets.</p><p>We know that that opening up helps their balance of payments, and it also helps the development of the renminbi as a reserve currency, the going global of China. That will happen, that's an inevitable part of the development.</p><p>Simultaneously though, we have to look at the United States and we have to think of its implications. There was a cycle that this happens. The rises of these reserve currencies happen because the countries become more competitive, technologies and all those things, balance of payments and they go global.</p><p>The declines of world reserve currencies happen quite often because they have reserve currencies. There's a lot of lending to them. And in the United States, we have to talk about the United States and the United States debt, government debt. We're talking a lot about China, and that's part of that puzzle, a big part of that puzzle. But we also have a real problem in terms of the quantity of debt that we're going to have to sell to the rest of the world over the next few years.</p><p>We have experienced a lot of stimulation because of a combination of the tax cuts and the stimulation. If you do the projections, the pro forma projections and think who's going to buy that amount of debt and the amount of debt that we have to sell, I think that that's going to be an issue. So when we're talking about the balance, I think the normal evolution will be globalization in which I would characterize China as basically allowing very free markets, in many ways, within boundaries and then not to let it go outside of that boundary of volatility. So, if I was to take a foreign exchange policy, you will have more freedom but you'll have boundaries so it can't go beyond those boundaries, which I think is a good thing.</p><p>But you're going to have that globalization, you're going to have the development of the currency and there is a problem or a challenge in terms of debt, which relates to the currency issue, because a bond is a promise to deliver a lot of currency. It just basically a pile of currency spread over a period of time. And I would say that if you were to take a longer-term perspective, two or three or four years that that's going to be an issue. And so I do think that capital flows and the nature of that balance of payments issue is going to be a factor in the years ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to comment on that, Dr. Fang, before we move on? I want to get questions from the audience and I do want to turn back to Europe, but first can you respond to what Ray just presented?</p><p>FANG: Yeah. Essentially, what Ray said is that the Chinese economy is so large, so whatever happens in China, it has a lot of impact on the world. And as we draw capital in, there will be capital flowing out.</p><p>I think one of the lessons that China learned over the last few years is that we know that we are a large economy so our impact on the rest of the world is something that we have to take into account and we make policies. So we want to make sure that the policy changes in China, as well as the economic variable changes in China, is not so large because if it's very big it's kind of very steep, it's going to have a very big impact on the rest of the world. And we understand that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Fang, let me ask you before we close the loop on this subject. Obviously, opening up the markets in China appears to be a priority ...</p><p>FANG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... for the Chinese leadership ...</p><p>FANG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... and to the rest of the world.</p><p>FANG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much of a priority is the force transfer of technology and I.P. theft?</p><p>FANG: I'm not an expert in this area. We are against forced technology transfer and I.P. theft. Of course, it's not something that we would like to see. I think we can sit down and talk about these things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would that be something as far as part of a deal with the United States that you would try to make progress on those issues?s</p><p>FANG: We are willing to talk to the United States on every issue that the U.S. raises.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And our overall objective is to have a cooperative relations in economics as well as in other areas with the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is such a rich topic. We can continue talking about it, but I want to hear from all of you because we have such informed and experienced group in the audience. Yes, Sir, right here.</p><p>Please say who you are. And by the way, this is being live-streamed on Top Link World Economic Forum as well as on Fox Business. You should know that. I wanted to say that from the beginning.</p><p>Please, Sir, go ahead.</p><p>ANTHONY HOBLEY: Thank you. My name is Anthony Hobley. I'm the CEO of the Carbon Tracker Initiative. I guess, we're a mission-driven, philanthropically-funded investment bank analysts.</p><p>The title of this session is \"Rethinking Global Financial Risk.\" In the WEF survey that just came out of global risks, like three or four out of top five is climate change. So why hasn't the C word or double C word even come up in this is conversation? Is this what Mark Carney said it's the tragedy of the horizons? So Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.</p><p>We've just had last week, I think, PG&amp;E now the California Utility Company put itself into Chapter 11 to protect itself from the liabilities from the wildfires, which has been exacerbated by climate change. So, I guess, my question to the panel is when you're talking about rethinking global financial risk, and the community that makes up WEF thinks that's one of the biggest issues of three or four of the biggest issues in the world, why haven't you even raised that as part of this conversation?</p><p>DALIO: I think there are a number of issues that we haven't raised in a limited amount of time. But I mean, of course, that's going to be a big business issue. I think that's correct. We didn't deal with the wealth gap, and we didn't deal with the technologies, and we didn't deal with the artificial intelligence, and we didn't deal with a whole laundry list of important things, limited amount of time. And I guess, we became more focused on China, but it is an important issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we will touch as well on Brexit because this is another uncertainty in Europe. How much of an issue are the issues in Europe as impacting the rest of the world? Very quickly.</p><p>WEBER: Well, I think it's an unfolding story. And last year, I remember when everyone sort of felt that the sky was the limit and there was a huge sort of common belief that things could only get better. This year I think the mood is a bit too gloomy.</p><p>I still have firm beliefs that policymakers are elected to provide solutions. Sometimes it's a winding road, sometimes there are setbacks, so this has been a pretty volatile evolving situation. I think ultimately it is not in anybody's interest to have an unorderly Brexit without new rules of the game being defined. If that requires because they started late and they didn't gain traction and they didn't agree early, that requires more time to negotiate. It's the rationale thing to do.</p><p>I think creating domestic acceptance for a deal you're about to sign is as important as having the other side agree to that deal with you. And so I think the Commission and everyone should give themselves the time in order to mitigate what is a tail risk for Europe.</p><p>I don't see calendar and basically triggering exit without really having the solution as a wise strategy. I didn't think that it was a wise strategy at the time. I think we're starting to see that the clock is running out. And the obvious thing for me to do when that is the case and you're not done is you should stop the clock and stop negotiations only then when you got a deal.</p><p>I think an unorderly Brexit in nobody's interest, and I take some reassurance by the fact that the British parliament is more deeply involved now in these discussions because, ultimately, the parliament has made clear that we want to move to a new stage where we want to do that in an orderly way. And not doing it without a deal is not something that is the preference of many (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think Britain leaves the European Union, but they will not do it in a hard way, they will do it with a well-thought-out trade situation with partners?</p><p>WEBER: I've have been in so many financially rescues 10 years ago. I always look at very difficult situation at one o'clock at night. By two o'clock when the Japanese markets opened, we needed a solution. Usually that last hour was where most of the things moved, so we're still almost 60 days away from that March end date. And I think there will be some own dynamics in this.</p><p>In the end, I think people have to start making compromises. It's OK to insist on your position if you're negotiating, but in the end if you want to deal, everyone needs to compromise. I haven't seen the compromises on the table so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's get as many questions as we can. And go ahead, Sir.</p><p>BRUJIS: My name is Marcos Brujis. I'm the Chief Executive of the IFC Asset Management Company, International Finance Corporation.</p><p>One thing that we've seen in China is that reserves have gone down from around $4 billion in 2014 to ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Four trillion.</p><p>BRUJIS: ... $4 trillion 2014, 2015. They are now below three, so it's ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Slightly above that.</p><p>BRUJIS: ... more than a trillion has been spent. A lot of this money has been spent through some of these sovereign and quasi sovereign wealth funds, SAVE (ph), CIC (ph), the money that went into AAAB (ph). And a lot of this money has gone to very risky markets. OK. I'm originally from Latin America, so I've been worried when I've seen some of that money go into Venezuela, which if you ask me, it's going to be hard to collect, let's put it mildly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>BRUJIS: My question to the panel is, if as a result of these very aggressive investments in very difficult markets in Africa, in South Asia that not all of them will go great, if you will see that China will, all of a sudden, begin borrowing a little bit in the United States style in order to continue funding, for example, its Belt and Road initiative?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Comment?</p><p>FANG: Well, I think, $3 trillion, we are still slightly above $3 trillion. And $3 trillion is perhaps more than enough, right, as foreign currency reserve. Now, of course, we can always make better use of the foreign currency reserve that we have, and you pointed out Venezuela or these countries, whether China is using its foreign currency reserve wisely or not, well, it remains to be seen, right? It still needs some more time, but we can always make improvement in these aspects.</p><p>KEYU: Fifteen years ago, the people were complaining that China was purchasing U.S. treasuries and losing money, and they had to go for higher return, more diversified assets. And you're seeing the consequence of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Sir?</p><p>MARINA (?): My name is Gilberto Marina (ph), the President of (inaudible). I would like to hear some comments about if they've reduced some risks in Latin America, especially in Brazil and Mexico?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great question and we will hear from the new President of Brazil at the World Economic Forum today at 3:30. Comments about Latin America?</p><p>DALIO: I think that the cycle in Brazil has been a good cycle in terms of the changes. Terrible balance payments, it became expensive. It was bank subsidies by the government, a number of things that created the classic balance payments crisis, classic debt crisis in which then the exchange rate became very cheap. And you had then the funding and it became somewhat attractive to invest in. And now we're dealing with the political questions that will come out of that.</p><p>So I would say, by and large, it's on a good track, but there are questions in terms of pension reforms, political reforms, corruption issues. All of those enter into a picture of what Brazil will look like coming forward, so I would say on a good track, but there's a lot to be seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we'll see what Mr. Bolsonaro says today from here in Davos.</p><p>Yes, Sir? Jacob?</p><p>FRENKEL: Thank you. I'm Jacob Frenkel, Chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. First of all, it was a fantastic panel.</p><p>It was taken for granted that the U.S. is ahead of the game in terms of recovery, but I want to make sure that we recognize that it's not just a cycle and we just need to wait and everything else will happen. It was the result of policies</p><p>There is a consensus. The reason why U.S. performance has been so positive, it reflects the corporate tax reform, it reflects policies concerning the trapped capital, it reflects the deregulation, it reflects the (inaudible) business and the like. So it's not a political the same but a statement that says, you want to see results, you better do some policies and it is the corporate sector that does the growth. Therefore, it needs to be not be the enemy but the partner.</p><p>Having said all of this and given that there are so many other sessions, still there is one overwhelming subject of risk that we do not have a good systemic answer to, and it has to do with the cyber. We do not have the international agreements about it and the like, and that's something with all of us are really losing sleep about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Jacob. As we wrap up, let me just reiterate some of the points that were made on this panel. It does appear that we are in a slowing economic environment, although Dr. Fang mentions that 6 percent growth is still quite attractive. And also, Keyu made the point that China will ultimately be the solution for the world in terms of demand and the place that we will see many imports coming in. China is now importing more last year than it actually exported.</p><p>Ray Dalio made a very important point in terms of capital flows and what your perception is in terms of, as this deleveraging goes on in China, what the impact will be on the dollar. It sounds like you will have concerns there.</p><p>You made the point on Brexit and the point on the European situation is what, that you believe Brexit will take place, but you do believe calmer heads will prevail and it will not be a hard exit?</p><p>WEBER: At least I hope so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You'll never know. I mean, but I think it would be completely irrational to let the situation get out of hand. Europe has been challenged last decade with homemade problems.</p><p>If you look at France, if you look at Germany, there are major leadership issues in all of our countries. And adding Brexit as a uncontrollable risk to that mix, we just said you're back for years to come. So I think it's in nobody's interest to really do a hasty exit without an organized deal. So, yes, I hope and I believe that policymakers will have second thoughts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you to our distinguished panel. Have a good day.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED: A very interesting panel we've been listening to over the last hour from Davos, Switzerland. The title of the panel, \"Rethinking Global Financial Risk.\" Maria Bartiromo, of course, leading that discussion, and there was a lot of talk, of course, about global economies and trade and a lot of talk about China.</p><p>We were obviously listening to those comments from Axel Weber, the UBS Chairman, about Brexit. He was saying, of course, he would like to see and hopes and believes that we will have orderly Brexit. But also I thought a lot of the interesting discussion is about China, about the economy. Six percent from that regulatory official from China, Fang Xinghai, talking about 6 percent global growth in China, and also the issue of the Chinese economy that the woman there, Jin Keyu, Harvard educated, we should say, talked about the fact that she believes that the Chinese will continue to buy debt from the United States. And that will be good news for the U.S. bond market, Lori.</p><p>ROTHMAN: To quote her, she is a professor at the London School of Economics as well, Jin Keyu. She also said the trade war is a benefit in disguise for China because of that external pressure for them to open up their economy and make some needed reforms</p><p>And to talk about all of this and much more, we bring in Altium Wealth Market Strategist, Michael Lee, and Nova Point Capital's Chief Investment Officer, Joe Sroka. Gentlemen, thank you for sticking with us, for listening in.</p><p>I want to start with you, Michael, and let's begin with China.</p><p>Mr. Fang said that Chinese economy will slow, but it will not collapse. And Maria Bartiromo asked very pointedly, \"You seem to be very willing to open up your economy, willing to do that, but what about Chinese leadership making it a priority to address intellectual property theft? And he really skirted that answer, Michael.</p><p>LEE: Yeah, absolutely, probably the funniest point of the entire hour presentation. But look, who would have thought that it would be Trump to force the Chinese to open up their markets. I think they've known they needed to do this for a long time, but he's very much accelerated the process by putting all sorts of external pressure on them.</p><p>China has a real issue in turning their populace into a consumption nation, and opening up their markets for direct foreign investments so you can have wealth accumulation not by those at the top will make a huge difference for them. As you heard from everyone on the panel, the key for China going forward is to open up their markets. And so China right now is -- what there is no mention of is that they are a communist nation and they are the number one enemy of the ...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200003369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V80-6DH1-JCRM-B1MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Data Licensing, LLC.

I'm Lauren Simonetti. Our Maria Bartiromo is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she is set to host a panel discussion with major market players including Bridgewater founder, Ray Dalio, and UBS Chairman, Axel Weber.   </p><p>      Let's listen in.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED</emphasis>:  ... going to recession. So it doesn't look to me like that's taking place, I think Marcus (ph), you're overreacting to short-term sentiment around a whole bunch of complex issues.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR</emphasis>:  Head spinning moves and uncertainty gripped globe last year with expectations of synchronized growth changing to expectations of a synchronized slowdown.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  The stock market rocked with wild moves up and down. But sadly, for investors, it's been more down than up.   </p><p>      In Europe, Brexit on the brink.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MAY</emphasis>:  I continue to believe that we can leave with a good deal and this is it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Paris in pieces. Citizens rioting over a gas tax designed to curb carbon emissions. All this as America's economy is humming in ways not seen in years. The president's tax plan kicking in January 1, helping to send second quarter GDP north of four percent and the unemployment rate all the way down to 3.7 percent.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED</emphasis>:  The fact that a business can write off 100 percent of an investment is an enormous incentive to get people to make capital investment and that capital investment creates more jobs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED</emphasis>:  Look how our workers having their best increase in many, many years. The American economy is crushing it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  But the euphoria faded by midyear as the president's America first policy meant renegotiating old trade deals. President Trump telling me in April that the United States will not back down until it has better terms with the rest of the world, notably China.   </p><p>      Are we going to back down on tariffs against China?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP</emphasis>:  No, no, no, no. No. China wants to make a deal. And so what? But it's got to be fair deal for this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  The administration calling out China over IP theft, the forced transfer of technology, spying on Americans, and lopsided protectionist tariffs. But while doing so, global growth worries persisted.   </p><p>      President Trump also calling out his federal reserve chairman for raising interest rates.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP</emphasis>:  I think that is making a mistake, so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  High rates and the China tensions roiling the equity markets by year's end with a big hit in the fourth quarter. The business world also still roiled by the Me Too Movement including media mogul, Les Moonves, of CBS, fired and deprived of a massive severance package after an investigation uncovered years of alleged sexual harassment.   </p><p>      It was also a year of big challenges for big tech.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ZUCKERBERG</emphasis>:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, it was my mistake and I'm sorry.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  The Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed that Cambridge Analytica took the personal data of millions of people's Facebook without their consent and it was used for political purposes. Facebook stock taking a beating and others such as Google, under the microscope for privacy issues leading to calls for tighter regulations.   </p><p>      Two thousand and eighteen saw a big change for the Internet, that very few noticed. Net neutrality was repealed by Trump administration despite promises of doom, the Internet seems to work the same as before.   </p><p>      But it is not the same as before for believers of bitcoin. A year ago, the cryptocurrency riding high near $20,000 but by yearend, crashing below $5,000.   </p><p>      The yearend midterm election set the tone for the year ahead with new uncertainty with the Democrats in the majority in the House, creating new questions over what can get done legislatively.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP</emphasis>:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Two thousand and nineteen begins with a new Congress and a divided government. That, traditionally, has been good for business and the stock market but the U.S. will need to ratify the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as come up with a new healthcare plan.   </p><p>      And in this year of a nontraditional president where business and politics overlap, you can be sure that more surprises are in store for 2019.   </p><p>      (END OF VIDEO TAPE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And we have a wonderful panel to address all of the above, in particular, the Global Expansion. Joining us right here on stage is Fang Xinghai, he is the Vice Chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission, the People's Republic of China.   </p><p>      With us this morning is Jin Keyu, Professor of Economics, London School of Economics; Ray Dalio is the Founder, Chairman, and Co-Chief Investment Officer at Bridgewater AssociatesUSA; and Axel Weber is the Chairman of UBS. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us.   </p><p>      Dr. Fang, let me kick it off with you. Given the prominence and implications and impact that China has on the world, how can you assess, the global storage day. How would you say China is doing economically speaking?   </p><p>      FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COMMISSION</emphasis>:  I think it's certain that the Chinese economy will slow down a little bit this year and that's because of trade, because of slowing down of the real estate market which is very much needed, by the way.   </p><p>      But slowing down in China is not a collapse, right? So last year, we grew at 6.6 percent, this year, perhaps something around six percent, let's say. And six percent is not very slow pace.   </p><p>      Now, the Chinese macro policies are very data dependent, I put it this way. So at this point, the government has already readied ph quite a set ph strong of fiscal policy as well as monetary policy.   </p><p>      But if things continue to challenging going forward, on the fiscal side, there's a lot room to expand. Some people worry about the overall debt in China. I think that, to the corporate sector, is a little bit too high. But the government sector can still leverage a lot and you're already seeing the local government issuing more of what we call project bond, the central government hasn't done so.   </p><p>      The ability for the central government to borrow more is also very large. So the bottom line is that China is slowing down but it's not going to be a disaster.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What areas would you say are seeing the most slowdown? I mean, because you make such an important point. It was the slowest pace of growth, in three decades in 2018, and yet, country on the globe would love to say it is growing 6 percent. So can you identify the specific industries that you believe are actually leading that slowdown?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Well, export is, one example. The data from December, for exports, was not very encouraging. And we will see.   </p><p>      I mean, maybe it's a response to the trade dispute with the United States. It could be also an indication of global slowing down and we will see how this will unfold.   </p><p>      On the consumption side, last year, actually did quite well. But then, I mentioned, the real estate market because housing prices are perhaps too high, and that squeezed a lot of money out of households, squeezed consumption, right? So we need to do a lot about housing.   </p><p>      And infrastructure is another area because a lot of infrastructures were done China by local governments. And during the last few years, China has tightened up the implicit debt that local governments could borrow but we've expanded the explicit debt that the local government can borrow.   </p><p>      So there's a room there. We will see how the slowdown of infrastructure spending is dealt with this year. But again, the Chinese macro policy is very, I would say, it's very responsive and also is data dependent.   </p><p>      So as things unfold, we will respond accordingly and the capacity for the Chinese government to respond to the economic slowdown is still very high. If anything, we should not overreact.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Ray Dalio, you have to allocate capital regardless of the environment as the backdrop and you've been doing that for years very effectively. In fact, even just in 2018, you were up almost 15 percent in the face of all of what have we are talking about, increasing debt levels, global slowdown, and so many other things. Tell us how you see the backdrop and how you do allocate capital in this environment?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RAY DALIO, FOUNDER/CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES</emphasis>:  Well, let's say the backdrop, maybe I start with a template. I think over a period of time, there's productivity and the growth rate of productivity is the most important thing. You'll learn more, you invent more, you become more efficient and that rises.   </p><p>      Then we have cycles around that. We have a normal business cycles, short-term debt cycle and then there is a longer-term debt cycle which has to do with the capacity of leveraging up being limited when you approach zero interest rates or limitations in terms of the effectiveness of quantitative easing.   </p><p>      So that framework is what I use when I'm looking at China, when I'm looking at any country. I think we make bigger picture. I think we are in the later stages of the short-term debt cycle. Meaning, maybe within the seventh or eighth inning of that and that there was an inappropriate mistaken desire to tighten monetary policy at a level that was faster than the capital markets could handle.   </p><p>      And as a result, we had a correction. We had 70 basis points change in rates, we had an important change in Fed policy regarding what the direction of Fed policy will be in that tightening. But we're in the later stages of the cycle when asset prices are fully -- were fully priced and still are somewhat fully priced.   </p><p>      I think the key question, like when we look at each country, when we look at China, look at Europe, look at the United States, we will be in a slowing economic environment. That growth rate will slow and then probably in a self-reinforcing process.   </p><p>      I think -- but the question really is where the monetary policy is the nominated one-zone currency. These are all cycles. The cycle, like in China, I agree. It's one of those cycles people pay attention to but they have the power, the debt is in currency, they can handle that cycle.   </p><p>      But there is a weakening there. There is a slowing -- certainly a substandard growth rate in Europe and in the United States, there will be a significant slowing in that particular period which should warrant an easier monetary policy. The bigger issues, so these are the cycles and then there's constraints of monetary policy for being able to deal with that.   </p><p>      Then the bigger issues, really connected to politics and the economic policies associated with that. For example, when we cut corporate taxes and we made interest rates low enough that it was attractive to borrow, to buy financial assets, particularly buy companies having mergers and conventions, that caused a lot of growth in corporate debt and that growth in corporate debt was used to finance those purchases which supported the financial markets.   </p><p>      So that is going to be less. So I think that probably next year, the slow up and then the beginning of thinking about politics and what that might affect economic policy beyond, something like the talk of the 70 percent income tax, for example, will play a greater role.   </p><p>      So I think that that's -- if I'm covering the world, U.S. and we live in a world economy, U.S., Europe, China, all of those will be experiencing a greater level of slowing, probably a greater level of disappointment. And I think, there's this reasonable chance that by the end of that, that that monetary policy and fiscal policy, they have to become easier relative to what is now discounted in the markets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I think you make such an important point. Because for a decade, we had such low interest rate, zero, and such easy monetary policy, not just in the United States but across the world as you see that being removed, it has to be disruptive, right?   </p><p>      And I think at the end of the year, markets were reacting to the unwind of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as much the raising of interest rates. So I ask you, do we even have the wiggle room, if you will, in terms of cutting rates, where they are?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DALIO</emphasis>:  No. I think you could look at the level of interest rates and compare that to zero. And think about that times the duration of the assets and that is the power that you can have in having financial assets impacted by easing a monetary policy.   </p><p>      Then you have to ask yourself in terms of the balance sheets, how much can the balance sheets be increased, what would be purchased and so on. So we -- what scares me the most longer term is that we have limitations to monetary policy which is our most valuable tool. We have important limitations to the effectiveness that at the same time as we have greater political and social antagonism.   </p><p>      So the next downturn in the economy worries me the most. I think that there are a lot of parallels with the late 1930s. 1929 to '32, we had a debt crisis interest rates at zero. Then there was a lot of printing of money, purchases of financial assets drive financial asset prices higher. Creates also a polarity, a populism and an antagonism.   </p><p>      We also had then at that time the phenomenon of a rising power like China dealing with the conflict of an existing power. These types of political issues are now very connected to economic issues and policy. So I think that that's the character of the environment we're in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Dr. Weber, you ran the Bundesbank for a time. I want to get your take on central bank policy as well. We also want to get into your assessment of China.   </p><p>      In December, your firm announced you can in fact own a bank in China. You announced this in December. So we'll get back to that. But first, assess the story as you heard Ray discuss in terms of central banks and the ability to react to a slowdown at this juncture.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, SWISS INVESTMENT BANK</emphasis>:  So Ray made the very important distinction between structure and business cycle and I think that's important. Structurally, interest rates in most of the western world as we bounce back from the financial crisis were very low for very long and markets have gotten used to that.   </p><p>      I think actually rates for at least for the better half of the last five years have been too low for the environment, for the economic environment we've been in. But, of course, Ray mentioned the other point that central banks waited very long time just keeping rates low because they were not gearing monetary policy towards the expected state of the economy and to the rebound of growth but they were in a kind of insurance policy where they wanted to mitigate any tail risk and therefore, kept rates longer just to eliminate tail risk to the economy.   </p><p>      And, of course, when they started lifting rates, they tightened rates in a late cycle stage. So the impact of that is that if you look at monetary policy easing, which is if you look at the room to maneuver, the only central bank that has any room to maneuver is actually the Federal Reserve.   </p><p>      If you look at traditional policy moves by the Fed, they lower rates very frequently at relatively large steps of 50 basis point. The Fed can do a number of interest rate steps down if need be. So I'm not worried about room to maneuver short term but as Ray also said, given that we've had so low rates for long, the market hasn't really priced in much higher rates. If anything, the Fed has come towards neutral. They're not quite as neutral but they're close to it.   </p><p>      And so, going back down is an emergency measure they can take. But I think it's more likely if you look at the year ahead that they're on pause now. I think we're going through a soft spot in the economy. Numbers have weakened, both in emerging markets and in developed markets over the (inaudible) and the first quarter.   </p><p>      We'll probably see a soft spot continuing into the first quarter of this year. And then after the middle of the year, we have some hope that that stuff might be behind us. And that's not the point where monetary policy moves from tightening to easing. That's the point where monetary policy takes a pause where they become data dependent, where they move into wait-and-see attitude.   </p><p>      I still have penciled in one or two rate hikes by the Fed over this year. But I think they'll take a pause now. They'll look at the data and if and when they resume, in my view, it won't be before midyear, and then I think the rest really very much depends on how the current conflicts that we haven't yet talked about, the tail risk like the trade war and some of the other tail risks, Brexit, how that affects the globe economy, what spillback is back into the U.S. and how monetary policy should react to that in the United States.   </p><p>      So I think central banks are on hold. The downside of central banks being on hold is the ECH will never even leave negative territory if they don't start raising rates this year. We still think there is some expectation that towards the end of the year they might do a 25 -- 20 basis basis point rate hike. But the chances with European data also coming in weaker. French data are looking weaker. German data are looking weaker. Eurozone doesn't look very strong.   </p><p>      The expectation is still more likely to postpone that into next year. So I think, in general, monetary policy normalization is not an issue for this cycle. It's for the next cycle. They won't get it done this time because the economy is weakening. And so, I think it will be mission aborted.   </p><p>      They will look at normalizing rates in the next cycle and they react to a slowing economy over the next year or two by a more muted and more cautious, more data-driven approach.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Should the Fed slow down on the unwind? $50 billion a month is what the fed had signaled in terms of selling securities.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  I think the unwind is less of an issue in the United States than it is in other constituencies because structurally, the Fed used to have a balance sheet that was around 750 billion.   </p><p>      Long term, I don't think the Fed will go back to its old size of the balance sheet. The central bank's balance sheets would be a much more central part of financial markets and they'd be a multiple of what we saw in central bank balance sheets then/   </p><p>      I think what the Fed needs to do is really look at sort of is that different role that central banks now have in global economy where markets are looking very much for monetary policy as very often the only game in town, is that the position central banks want to be in?   </p><p>      Our Chinese friend just said the right thing, if you look at macro policies, monetary policy can react quickly because it's done by committee of elected bureaucrats. The real bigger impact you get from fiscal policy, it reacts slower, it needs to go through parliament, decision likes are longer, but it's much more impactful.   </p><p>      And then the structural policies, don't forget the supply side. China is, at the moment, reacting with this demand side measures both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling. But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in open market. That creates a lot of growth potential. That creates productivity enhancements. And so, along what Ray said, we're too focused on managing demand and managing sort of cyclical movement. We should be lot more focused on longer term structural issues in getting those right because I think the other stuff is very much a distraction.   </p><p>      You can't spend time and money to cushion the economy against the downturn. But it's much better to enhance the growth potential of the economies so that the downturn doesn't really need to such a big reset every time it happens and it happens time and again.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. Let's stay on this point for a moment in terms of China and the structural changes that we're seeing and the impact on the rest of the world. Keyu, your thoughts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LSE</emphasis>:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb. So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.   </p><p>      So if we look at the kind of deleveraging, the different sectors, financial sectors deleveraging has been successful. Most of the debt to assets have stabilized. Household debt is increasing but household debt was very low and one can argue too low for a while in China.   </p><p>      So these efforts have made China financially much safer. And as a consequence, there will be a slowdown in economic growth, part of it is, of course, kind of triggered by external factors. But much of this is the deliberate effort of the government to slow down the credit growth, et cetera.   </p><p>      Now, of course, growth has now become more of an issue that the government is always treading between -- the line between financial risk and economic growth and now, they're shifting their focus more on revamping the growth.   </p><p>      And as Dr. Fang has mentioned, China has a whole set -- the Chinese government has a whole set of tools that are not normally available to other economies whether it's the massive assets on the government balance sheet or the huge amount of savings in China or just the simply coordination, coordination of different state-owned banks and state-owned local governments. All these things matter.   </p><p>      That said, despite the fact that there are a lot of instruments to work with, I think China's main challenge is really how to unleash the real potential of the real economy. Right now, monetary policy is expanding. You're injecting more liquidity. You're pushing for proactive fiscal policy and reducing taxes.   </p><p>      But the credit gets stuck in the financial sector. If it actually goes into the real economy, we are confident that their real big forces of positive changes for Chinese economy whether it's entrepreneurship, it's innovation, the fact that services are rising, service productivity is rising, urbanization.   </p><p>      But the trouble is really the financial system and how to match the investment and savers and also give the household more ability to consume, right? If you're -- if the real interest rate on bank deposits, which most of the savings is stuck, is earning zero in the last 10 years or 20 years while the economy is growing at six to eight percent, you're not giving that potential to the household and to the private sector. So it's all about unleashing the latent dynamism in the private sector.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you think the opening up of markets, do you think this trade issue with the United States will in fact impact the real economy in China?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JIN</emphasis>:  I think that trade war has come as a benefit in disguise because it is serving as the external pressure for China to undertake some of these really important reforms. And as Axel has mentioned, financial services has opened up where it's really kind of on schedule to open up vastly.   </p><p>      Consumers are now able to purchase many more goods from the U.S. and from the rest of the world. China needs competition. So the financial sector needs competition. It needs to be injected with new blood and it is such things that will help with that.   </p><p>      So opening up in general, which is consistent, with China's longer-term goals, is simply accelerated by the recent trade war.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Dr. Fang, do you want to say something?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XINGHAI</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes. Dr. Weber had a very good point and that is as China right now seems to focus on macro demand management, the supply side policy has not been stopped. We continued to push forward for supply side well because of supply-side structural reform.   </p><p>      And I'll give you a few examples. Opening up the financial sector for more international competition is one example and Dr. Weber can state (ph) to that. In the manufacturing sector, BASF recently was given the opportunity to establish a 100 percent-owned massive petrochemical plant in China.   </p><p>      They used to be a 50/50 JV requirement and now this requirement is gone. China has reduced input duty in a very substantial way. So there's more competition in the consumer market.   </p><p>      So the supply-side policy continued and that's very important point. And just to this audience, I want to say another word that is -- that China's vision for the economy is to make it open and large and competitive. So it's not only an opportunity for the Chinese companies but it would also be a huge opportunity for all the companies from the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, Ray, you've been in China for 30 years. You've been visiting there for 30 years. Axel, your firm just announced you now own a financial institution that you own 51 percent of, is that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  Yes. We were the first bank that was offered a 51 percent stake in a joint venture and we've executed that in December and we now are the majority owner. We already had management control and we're now free to increase that stake further.   </p><p>      I think eventually as we invest in China and since our major partners are the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, there's likely going to happen some delusion of our partners. And we're looking into ways of raising capital also locally.   </p><p>      So there is welcome discussion between the Chinese authorities, much as with Hong Kong on the Shanghai-Hong Kong Bond Connect. But also, there was an ongoing discussion with London. I know that Dr. Fang is talking to the Swiss authorities.   </p><p>      So the more we can connect stock markets, the more we can actually be super connectors as international financial institutions to bring international investors into the Chinese economy and help Chinese investors invest in the rest of the world.   </p><p>      And it's absolutely right what our Chinese colleagues have said, the Chinese economy needs competition and they're working, I think, on three legs of that. First is state-owned enterprise reform and I think that is very important and we've all gone through that in Europe in the '90s of having former official sector conglomerates move to the private sector.   </p><p>      The second one is competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises in China. And the third one is, and the authority so far has been more cautious, opening up the Chinese economy for international competition because that will really be a major contribution to increasing the competitiveness of companies.   </p><p>      And, of course, we as international experienced investors can help in that process and actually can help both Chinese investors internationally and international investors in China.   </p><p>      Just to give you an example, banks like UBS, we have 24 percent share on the northbound traffic of the Asia market in the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect. So, we're kind of the go-to bank for a quarter of the investors into mainland China internationally.   </p><p>      Our market share for Chinese investors southbound (ph) is below 1 percent. We're not the go-to bank for international investments for Chinese citizens. And as we're granted majority rights as we're investing in our business, we just doubled our headcount in China over the last few years. We will become a major go-to partner also for Chinese investors in the global economy, but that will happen at a more measured pace because there is some concern in China that this will impact on the exchange rate. So the opening-up process is more controlled, but it's happening.   </p><p>      Don't mistake speed for direction. The direction is very clear. The speed, I think, has been really sort of increased recently. Actually, I was just in China in the first weekend.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yeah.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  The constructive dialogues we had with Chinese authority is really on a totally different page today than it was a few years ago. So I'm very confident about this process.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Let's not forget of top 20 banks in the world, the top five are Chinese.   </p><p>      Ray?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DALIO</emphasis>:  Well, you mentioned I've been there 30 years and I've watched it evolved. And I think there are two types of things that are going on. Let's call them the short-term and the long-term, right?   </p><p>      As I said, productivity is the big thing in the long-term, and that's a real big thing. Then you have the short-term debt cycles and you have the short-term thing. So the two things that are happening short-term is that you are having deleveraging that you so articulately dealt with. There was an overleveraging and there was a development of the financial markets.   </p><p>      Not long ago, it was really five or six years ago, five major banks loaned money to state-owned enterprises and the money was clogged at the top. Then there was the development of the shadow banking system and the liberalization of that and now put into place regulation. Whenever you're having a deleveraging, that is something that makes the country healthier because you're deleveraging, but it has short-term effect, but it has a long-term positive. So there's the deleveraging happening. It's a short-term thing. And then there's the trade issues associated with that, which is also a short-term thing.   </p><p>      But if you take productivity growth, if you take the approach, I think it really has to be admired as Chinese characteristics as it's described. It's a cultural challenge for the West, but there's a top-down way of setting a mission for 2025 plan or a plan and working those things in the top-down way with unique resources available that has produced in the time that I've been there an increase of 20 times in incomes. It used to be the below poverty level. The 88 percent of the population was below poverty level. Today it's less than 1 percent.   </p><p>      There is an ability to produce productivity, but it's a culture clash with the West, in some ways, because as one of the leaders described it to me, the United States is a country of individualists. An individual is working that up. China is more of a country that is an extension of the model of the family. And he described, he said, \"There is the word 'country', in China, represents state family.\" And if you go back to Confucianism and how it is run top-down, and that is where there is an element of a culture clash.   </p><p>      At the same time, when you look at that productivity and the policies and things, it's a very effective place. So, I would say it's important to distinguish the short-term influences from longer-term productivity influences and then recognize that we're in a world where there is a competition and that could mean conflict in different dimensions between the two countries. That means, I think the trade issue is a manageable issue.   </p><p>      I think the way of being issue is a challenging issue because Americans can't expect Chinese to operate in a way that is different from that or vice versa. So I think that's the bigger long-term issue, but I think you'd have to be very optimistic when you think of even a 5 percent or a 6 percent growth rate and what that's going to mean and what the world will look like in 10 or 20 years. It will be quite a different world in which China is going to be, I think, a lot stronger. So I think that's the picture. Let's not confuse the short-term with that bigger picture, evolutionary picture.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  But what about the picture of debt? I mean, how worried should we be about debt, particularly, the U.S. has to sell debt. China, obviously, one of the biggest, most significant holders of the US' debt. Are any of these issues, Dr. Fang, in terms of the trade spat, in terms of slowing growth in China are the biggest significant holders of the U.S. debt are any of these issues, in terms of the trade spat in terms of slowing growth in China, are they impacting capital flows?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XINGHAI</emphasis>:  China will continue to be what we call a \"savings surplus country\" for some time, although the saving is declining, but it will be a saving surplus country. So we have to invest abroad. The U.S. government bond market turns out to be a good place to invest, so I don't think China will, in any way, significantly reduce its investment into the U.S. government bond market.   </p><p>      But on the other hand, in terms of capital flow, we do open up. We want more companies from different sectors to come into China, so that should increase capital inflows. We want to increase both way.   </p><p>      Maria, I want to add one point to what Ray Dalio just said about the culture shock, right? China does have different approach to economic management. And I think at this world, perhaps we should learn from each other a little bit. And I want to give you one example how we manage our financial risk.   </p><p>      Over the last 40 years, China hasn't had a very significant financial crisis, for example, and that's very rare among the developing world. And I used to work for the World Bank and we have financial crisis in developing countries a lot. And how China has been able to avoid financial crisis, right, in the last 40 years, well, we have a very top-down approach to financial risk management, and that is the a central government constantly is in touch with the financial sector, get information from the financial sector in a timely manner. And if there's any risk accumulating the system, the government will step in and order the risk to be reduced.   </p><p>      Now, of course, sometimes we will still miss something, right? So occasionally we have certain financial jitteries in the market. But once we have that financial jittery, our system is able to react to these jitteries in a very quick way, and we move quickly to contain the risk so that the risk does not spread into the entire system and it does not create panic in the system. And then as the economy grows the risk is diluted going forward, so that's how we have been able to grow our economy by so much and grow the financial system by so much without incurring a major financial risk. So there's some lesson there, I think, that the rest of the world perhaps should take a look at.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  I think, if I may, there's also a point of no return in this whole thing about opening up for China because you have to look at China's weight in the global economy has really increased massively. China is bordering on to at least 20 percent weight in the global economy. If you look at exports, if you look at global growth, still today, most of the growth that we see globally is generated by China's inclusion into world economy.   </p><p>      Now, that is reflected by now putting China a lot more into portfolios because you can't just have a big part of the global economy with Chinese, and investors completely haves zero exposure to that growth in their portfolio. So China gets inclusions into indices, like the MSCI, in the equity indices or in the bond indices like the Bloomberg Index. Our estimate is, over the next quarters, there will be 250 billion of capital inflows into China, basically just by this 4 percent weight that China will get.   </p><p>      Now, so far Ray is absolutely right, China debt is not a problem because it's largely domestically held. Domestic policies and redistribution of their debt can easily be engineered by policymakers.   </p><p>      International investors, if they invest in China debt or equity, they want different standards. They want accounting standards. They want very clear, solid products to invest in. So, what is happening is that will raise the standards and the bars for equity markets in China because you need to bring international investors in and you also need to allow, because you just don't want a big inflow into the Chinese economy that puts upward pressure on the exchange rate, you need to open up and sync international investments for your citizens to invest into rest of the world so you create capital outflows.   </p><p>      So in the future, the whole debate about QFII and QDII quotas will be a lot more interlinked because large banks like us who compete at the top level for Chinese clients will have to do both, only if our action is not just one-sided by bringing international capital in. But also having Chinese invest abroad, we will not have an impact in what we do on policy preferences like no impact on the exchange rate. So I think there is a point of no return where you simply once you open up, you get included in this index, you get drawn into the global economy, and that's where I think you really need to do the supply-side reforms to do that in a more resilient manner.   </p><p>      So, I'm not worried about the sort of credit cycling in China, at the moment, because the Chinese Central Bank can really create a lot more monetary stimulus without even touching interest rates. Reserve requirements are at -- 23 percent, I think, is the last number I saw. You can massively reduce reserve requirements for domestic banks and create credit origination without really doing anything, so the interest rate (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XINGHAI</emphasis>:  On this point of no return of opening up, the main reason is that is opening up is good for China.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XINGHAI</emphasis>:  You mentioned the Asia inclusion into the MSCI Index, and the effect of that inclusion is already felt in the Chinese market in terms of raising the quality of the market because we now have to respond to the demand of the international institutional investors.   </p><p>      So just give you a very concrete example, in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we used to calculate the closing price of a stock by its last trade, and that's not very good for international investors. Now, according to their request, we have changed that into the average price of the last three minutes in a concentrated trading manner. And now it's much better according to the international investors. So this is just very small example of how opening up has been good for China, and we will continue to do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEYU</emphasis>:  I would like to push back on a little bit at this point. If we look back, maybe 200 years back, this century's financial history might well be written by China.   </p><p>      Now, it's not just a question whether China is ready or not for opening up, and here we're talking not just about opening up to trade, but opening up capital accounts and exchange rate flexibility. The question is, is the world ready?   </p><p>      Let us be reminded that China is still a developing country with a financial system with a whole array of issues. Because of the weight, it has an economy because even so far it hasn't opened up the financial linkages, but when it does, all of its volatility in China will transmit to the world in much greater proportions that we've seen. 2015, 2017, these were small movements in China and they sent jitters to the financial markets.   </p><p>      Now, imagine a really open Chinese market. The point behind this is should China not consider domestic financial reforms, sort its domestic issues first before thinking about really wide-scale opening up, in which case the financial linkages would be much stronger. So the world also needs to understand that the second largest economy in the world and the ones that's going to be transmitting the volatility is still a developing country. That's the first point.   </p><p>      The second is we've talked about how most of us agree that the debt problems in China are within management. I would say definitely the same, but it's really about how this debt is used and how this credit is used.   </p><p>      Since 2009, the RMB4 trillion fiscal stimulus has led to a gross misallocation of resources, so it's not so much the level of debt, the amount of credit in the economy, but where it is going. Is it just going to big SOEs, low-productivity firms, infrastructure projects or is this credit channeled to productive parts of the sector? Now, if a misallocation of resources can be reduced then there's enormous potential for China to continue to grow.   </p><p>      Lastly, I want to point to two facts that we've recently seen. For the first time in decades, in the first half of 2018, China is now importing more from the world than its exporting. It's running a current account deficit. That has huge implications.   </p><p>      Now two gentlemen on my left have talked about low interest rates, about challenges to monetary policy, both in Europe and the U.S. China will serve as a main source of aggregate demand where aggregate demand, as we have seen, is very lacking in the rest of the world. Inflation was not come up. Interest rates are still at record low levels. China will potentially be an important source of aggregate demand going forward now that it's importing more. So, pushing for a divorce with China is not necessarily a good idea.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XINGHAI</emphasis>:  Keyu reminded me as a regulator of our responsibilities, right? Because as China draws more capital into its financial market, the jitteries inside China can have a huge impact in the international world. And we have raised our capabilities to do a better job.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DALIO</emphasis>:  I think we also have to look at what's happening in light of the rises and declines of reserve currencies in the world and the normal patterns. And if you look at it, from the Dutch guilder, the British pound and the U.S. dollar, and now China and how countries evolve and you look at those patterns over a series of history, we know that, first of all, technology is the leading reason for the developments.   </p><p>      We know that each of those countries has to go global with their currency and their banks. We know that they have to be developed their financial markets. Every one of those has had a financial center. Amsterdam was, London was, New York was, and now in China, they must have their financial markets.   </p><p>      We know that that opening up helps their balance of payments, and it also helps the development of the renminbi as a reserve currency, the going global of China. That will happen, that's an inevitable part of the development.   </p><p>      Simultaneously though, we have to look at the United States and we have to think of its implications. There was a cycle that this happens. The rises of these reserve currencies happen because the countries become more competitive, technologies and all those things, balance of payments and they go global.   </p><p>      The declines of world reserve currencies happen quite often because they have reserve currencies. There's a lot of lending to them. And in the United States, we have to talk about the United States and the United States debt, government debt. We're talking a lot about China, and that's part of that puzzle, a big part of that puzzle. But we also have a real problem in terms of the quantity of debt that we're going to have to sell to the rest of the world over the next few years.   </p><p>      We have experienced a lot of stimulation because of a combination of the tax cuts and the stimulation. If you do the projections, the pro forma projections and think who's going to buy that amount of debt and the amount of debt that we have to sell, I think that that's going to be an issue. So when we're talking about the balance, I think the normal evolution will be globalization in which I would characterize China as basically allowing very free markets, in many ways, within boundaries and then not to let it go outside of that boundary of volatility. So, if I was to take a foreign exchange policy, you will have more freedom but you'll have boundaries so it can't go beyond those boundaries, which I think is a good thing.   </p><p>      But you're going to have that globalization, you're going to have the development of the currency and there is a problem or a challenge in terms of debt, which relates to the currency issue, because a bond is a promise to deliver a lot of currency. It just basically a pile of currency spread over a period of time. And I would say that if you were to take a longer-term perspective, two or three or four years that that's going to be an issue. And so I do think that capital flows and the nature of that balance of payments issue is going to be a factor in the years ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You want to comment on that, Dr. Fang, before we move on? I want to get questions from the audience and I do want to turn back to Europe, but first can you respond to what Ray just presented?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Yeah. Essentially, what Ray said is that the Chinese economy is so large, so whatever happens in China, it has a lot of impact on the world. And as we draw capital in, there will be capital flowing out.   </p><p>      I think one of the lessons that China learned over the last few years is that we know that we are a large economy so our impact on the rest of the world is something that we have to take into account and we make policies. So we want to make sure that the policy changes in China, as well as the economic variable changes in China, is not so large because if it's very big it's kind of very steep, it's going to have a very big impact on the rest of the world. And we understand that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Dr. Fang, let me ask you before we close the loop on this subject. Obviously, opening up the markets in China appears to be a priority ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... for the Chinese leadership ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... and to the rest of the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  How much of a priority is the force transfer of technology and I.P. theft?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  I'm not an expert in this area. We are against forced technology transfer and I.P. theft. Of course, it's not something that we would like to see. I think we can sit down and talk about these things.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Would that be something as far as part of a deal with the United States that you would try to make progress on those issues?s   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  We are willing to talk to the United States on every issue that the U.S. raises.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      And our overall objective is to have a cooperative relations in economics as well as in other areas with the United States.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  This is such a rich topic. We can continue talking about it, but I want to hear from all of you because we have such informed and experienced group in the audience. Yes, Sir, right here.   </p><p>      Please say who you are. And by the way, this is being live-streamed on Top Link World Economic Forum as well as on Fox Business. You should know that. I wanted to say that from the beginning.   </p><p>      Please, Sir, go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANTHONY HOBLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. My name is Anthony Hobley. I'm the CEO of the Carbon Tracker Initiative. I guess, we're a mission-driven, philanthropically-funded investment bank analysts.   </p><p>      The title of this session is \"Rethinking Global Financial Risk.\" In the WEF survey that just came out of global risks, like three or four out of top five is climate change. So why hasn't the C word or double C word even come up in this is conversation? Is this what Mark Carney said it's the tragedy of the horizons? So Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.   </p><p>      We've just had last week, I think, PG&amp;E now the California Utility Company put itself into Chapter 11 to protect itself from the liabilities from the wildfires, which has been exacerbated by climate change. So, I guess, my question to the panel is when you're talking about rethinking global financial risk, and the community that makes up WEF thinks that's one of the biggest issues of three or four of the biggest issues in the world, why haven't you even raised that as part of this conversation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DALIO</emphasis>:  I think there are a number of issues that we haven't raised in a limited amount of time. But I mean, of course, that's going to be a big business issue. I think that's correct. We didn't deal with the wealth gap, and we didn't deal with the technologies, and we didn't deal with the artificial intelligence, and we didn't deal with a whole laundry list of important things, limited amount of time. And I guess, we became more focused on China, but it is an important issue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And we will touch as well on Brexit because this is another uncertainty in Europe. How much of an issue are the issues in Europe as impacting the rest of the world? Very quickly.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's an unfolding story. And last year, I remember when everyone sort of felt that the sky was the limit and there was a huge sort of common belief that things could only get better. This year I think the mood is a bit too gloomy.   </p><p>      I still have firm beliefs that policymakers are elected to provide solutions. Sometimes it's a winding road, sometimes there are setbacks, so this has been a pretty volatile evolving situation. I think ultimately it is not in anybody's interest to have an unorderly Brexit without new rules of the game being defined. If that requires because they started late and they didn't gain traction and they didn't agree early, that requires more time to negotiate. It's the rationale thing to do.   </p><p>      I think creating domestic acceptance for a deal you're about to sign is as important as having the other side agree to that deal with you. And so I think the Commission and everyone should give themselves the time in order to mitigate what is a tail risk for Europe.   </p><p>      I don't see calendar and basically triggering exit without really having the solution as a wise strategy. I didn't think that it was a wise strategy at the time. I think we're starting to see that the clock is running out. And the obvious thing for me to do when that is the case and you're not done is you should stop the clock and stop negotiations only then when you got a deal.   </p><p>      I think an unorderly Brexit in nobody's interest, and I take some reassurance by the fact that the British parliament is more deeply involved now in these discussions because, ultimately, the parliament has made clear that we want to move to a new stage where we want to do that in an orderly way. And not doing it without a deal is not something that is the preference of many (inaudible).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So you think Britain leaves the European Union, but they will not do it in a hard way, they will do it with a well-thought-out trade situation with partners?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  I've have been in so many financially rescues 10 years ago. I always look at very difficult situation at one o'clock at night. By two o'clock when the Japanese markets opened, we needed a solution. Usually that last hour was where most of the things moved, so we're still almost 60 days away from that March end date. And I think there will be some own dynamics in this.   </p><p>      In the end, I think people have to start making compromises. It's OK to insist on your position if you're negotiating, but in the end if you want to deal, everyone needs to compromise. I haven't seen the compromises on the table so far.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Let's get as many questions as we can. And go ahead, Sir.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRUJIS</emphasis>:  My name is Marcos Brujis. I'm the Chief Executive of the IFC Asset Management Company, International Finance Corporation.   </p><p>      One thing that we've seen in China is that reserves have gone down from around $4 billion in 2014 to ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  Four trillion.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRUJIS</emphasis>:  ... $4 trillion 2014, 2015. They are now below three, so it's ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  Slightly above that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRUJIS</emphasis>:  ... more than a trillion has been spent. A lot of this money has been spent through some of these sovereign and quasi sovereign wealth funds, SAVE (ph), CIC (ph), the money that went into AAAB (ph). And a lot of this money has gone to very risky markets. OK. I'm originally from Latin America, so I've been worried when I've seen some of that money go into Venezuela, which if you ask me, it's going to be hard to collect, let's put it mildly.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yeah.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRUJIS</emphasis>:  My question to the panel is, if as a result of these very aggressive investments in very difficult markets in Africa, in South Asia that not all of them will go great, if you will see that China will, all of a sudden, begin borrowing a little bit in the United States style in order to continue funding, for example, its Belt and Road initiative?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Comment?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FANG</emphasis>:  Well, I think, $3 trillion, we are still slightly above $3 trillion. And $3 trillion is perhaps more than enough, right, as foreign currency reserve. Now, of course, we can always make better use of the foreign currency reserve that we have, and you pointed out Venezuela or these countries, whether China is using its foreign currency reserve wisely or not, well, it remains to be seen, right? It still needs some more time, but we can always make improvement in these aspects.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEYU</emphasis>:  Fifteen years ago, the people were complaining that China was purchasing U.S. treasuries and losing money, and they had to go for higher return, more diversified assets. And you're seeing the consequence of that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, Sir?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINA (?)</emphasis>:  My name is Gilberto Marina (ph), the President of (inaudible). I would like to hear some comments about if they've reduced some risks in Latin America, especially in Brazil and Mexico?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Great question and we will hear from the new President of Brazil at the World Economic Forum today at 3:30. Comments about Latin America?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DALIO</emphasis>:  I think that the cycle in Brazil has been a good cycle in terms of the changes. Terrible balance payments, it became expensive. It was bank subsidies by the government, a number of things that created the classic balance payments crisis, classic debt crisis in which then the exchange rate became very cheap. And you had then the funding and it became somewhat attractive to invest in. And now we're dealing with the political questions that will come out of that.   </p><p>      So I would say, by and large, it's on a good track, but there are questions in terms of pension reforms, political reforms, corruption issues. All of those enter into a picture of what Brazil will look like coming forward, so I would say on a good track, but there's a lot to be seen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And we'll see what Mr. Bolsonaro says today from here in Davos.   </p><p>      Yes, Sir? Jacob?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRENKEL</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'm Jacob Frenkel, Chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. First of all, it was a fantastic panel.   </p><p>      It was taken for granted that the U.S. is ahead of the game in terms of recovery, but I want to make sure that we recognize that it's not just a cycle and we just need to wait and everything else will happen. It was the result of policies   </p><p>      There is a consensus. The reason why U.S. performance has been so positive, it reflects the corporate tax reform, it reflects policies concerning the trapped capital, it reflects the deregulation, it reflects the (inaudible) business and the like. So it's not a political the same but a statement that says, you want to see results, you better do some policies and it is the corporate sector that does the growth. Therefore, it needs to be not be the enemy but the partner.   </p><p>      Having said all of this and given that there are so many other sessions, still there is one overwhelming subject of risk that we do not have a good systemic answer to, and it has to do with the cyber. We do not have the international agreements about it and the like, and that's something with all of us are really losing sleep about.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thank you so much, Jacob. As we wrap up, let me just reiterate some of the points that were made on this panel. It does appear that we are in a slowing economic environment, although Dr. Fang mentions that 6 percent growth is still quite attractive. And also, Keyu made the point that China will ultimately be the solution for the world in terms of demand and the place that we will see many imports coming in. China is now importing more last year than it actually exported.   </p><p>      Ray Dalio made a very important point in terms of capital flows and what your perception is in terms of, as this deleveraging goes on in China, what the impact will be on the dollar. It sounds like you will have concerns there.   </p><p>      You made the point on Brexit and the point on the European situation is what, that you believe Brexit will take place, but you do believe calmer heads will prevail and it will not be a hard exit?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEBER</emphasis>:  At least I hope so.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      You'll never know. I mean, but I think it would be completely irrational to let the situation get out of hand. Europe has been challenged last decade with homemade problems.   </p><p>      If you look at France, if you look at Germany, there are major leadership issues in all of our countries. And adding Brexit as a uncontrollable risk to that mix, we just said you're back for years to come. So I think it's in nobody's interest to really do a hasty exit without an organized deal. So, yes, I hope and I believe that policymakers will have second thoughts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you to our distinguished panel. Have a good day.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED</emphasis>:  A very interesting panel we've been listening to over the last hour from Davos, Switzerland. The title of the panel, \"Rethinking Global Financial Risk.\" Maria Bartiromo, of course, leading that discussion, and there was a lot of talk, of course, about global economies and trade and a lot of talk about China.   </p><p>      We were obviously listening to those comments from Axel Weber, the UBS Chairman, about Brexit. He was saying, of course, he would like to see and hopes and believes that we will have orderly Brexit. But also I thought a lot of the interesting discussion is about China, about the economy. Six percent from that regulatory official from China, Fang Xinghai, talking about 6 percent global growth in China, and also the issue of the Chinese economy that the woman there, Jin Keyu, Harvard educated, we should say, talked about the fact that she believes that the Chinese will continue to buy debt from the United States. And that will be good news for the U.S. bond market, Lori.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROTHMAN</emphasis>:  To quote her, she is a professor at the London School of Economics as well, Jin Keyu. She also said the trade war is a benefit in disguise for China because of that external pressure for them to open up their economy and make some needed reforms   </p><p>      And to talk about all of this and much more, we bring in Altium Wealth Market Strategist, Michael Lee, and Nova Point Capital's Chief Investment Officer, Joe Sroka. Gentlemen, thank you for sticking with us, for listening in.   </p><p>      I want to start with you, Michael, and let's begin with China.   </p><p>      Mr. Fang said that Chinese economy will slow, but it will not collapse. And Maria Bartiromo asked very pointedly, \"You seem to be very willing to open up your economy, willing to do that, but what about Chinese leadership making it a priority to address intellectual property theft? And he really skirted that answer, Michael.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yeah, absolutely, probably the funniest point of the entire hour presentation. But look, who would have thought that it would be Trump to force the Chinese to open up their markets. I think they've known they needed to do this for a long time, but he's very much accelerated the process by putting all sorts of external pressure on them.   </p><p>      China has a real issue in turning their populace into a consumption nation, and opening up their markets for direct foreign investments so you can have wealth accumulation not by those at the top will make a huge difference for them. As you heard from everyone on the panel, the key for China going forward is to open up their markets. And so China right now is -- what there is no mention of is that they are a communist nation and they are the number one enemy of the ...  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V83-J5B1-JDPT-T2NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

So it doesn't look to melike that's taking place, I think Marcus (ph), you're overreactingto short-term sentiment around a whole bunch of complex issues.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR:  Head spinning moves anduncertainty gripped globe last year with expectations ofsynchronized growth changing to expectations of a synchronizedslowdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The stock market rocked with wild moves up and down.But sadly, for investors, it's been more down than up.</p><p>In Europe, Brexit on the brink.</p><p>MAY:  I continue to believe that we can leave with a good dealand this is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paris in pieces. Citizens rioting over a gas taxdesigned to curb carbon emissions. All this as America's economy ishumming in ways not seen in years. The president's tax plan kickingin January 1, helping to send second quarter GDP north of fourpercent and the unemployment rate all the way down to 3.7 percent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED:  The fact that a business can write off 100percent of an investment is an enormous incentive to get people tomake capital investment and that capital investment creates morejobs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED:  Look how our workers having their best increasein many, many years. The American economy is crushing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the euphoria faded by midyear as the president'sAmerica first policy meant renegotiating old trade deals. PresidentTrump telling me in April that the United States will not back downuntil it has better terms with the rest of the world, notably China.</p><p>Are we going to back down on tariffs against China?</p><p>TRUMP:  No, no, no, no. No. China wants to make a deal. And sowhat? But it's got to be fair deal for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The administration calling out China over IP theft,the forced transfer of technology, spying on Americans, and lopsidedprotectionist tariffs. But while doing so, global growth worriespersisted.</p><p>President Trump also calling out his federal reserve chairmanfor raising interest rates.</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that is making a mistake, so tight. I think theFed has gone crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  High rates and the China tensions roiling the equitymarkets by year's end with a big hit in the fourth quarter. Thebusiness world also still roiled by the Me Too Movement includingmedia mogul, Les Moonves, of CBS, fired and deprived of a massiveseverance package after an investigation uncovered years of allegedsexual harassment.</p><p>It was also a year of big challenges for big tech.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough view of ourresponsibility, it was my mistake and I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandalrevealed that Cambridge Analytica took the personal data of millionsof people's Facebook without their consent and it was used forpolitical purposes. Facebook stock taking a beating and others suchas Google, under the microscope for privacy issues leading to callsfor tighter regulations.</p><p>Two thousand and eighteen saw a big change for the Internet,that very few noticed. Net neutrality was repealed by Trumpadministration despite promises of doom, the Internet seems to workthe same as before.</p><p>But it is not the same as before for believers of bitcoin. Ayear ago, the cryptocurrency riding high near $20,000 but byyearend, crashing below $5,000.</p><p>The yearend midterm election set the tone for the year aheadwith new uncertainty with the Democrats in the majority in theHouse, creating new questions over what can get done legislatively.</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for bordersecurity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two thousand and nineteen begins with a new Congressand a divided government. That, traditionally, has been good forbusiness and the stock market but the U.S. will need to ratify thenew trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as come up with a newhealthcare plan.</p><p>And in this year of a nontraditional president where businessand politics overlap, you can be sure that more surprises are instore for 2019.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we have a wonderful panel to address all of theabove, in particular, the Global Expansion. Joining us right here onstage is Fang Xinghai, he is the Vice Chairman of China SecuritiesRegulatory Commission, the People's Republic of China.</p><p>With us this morning is Jin Keyu, Professor of Economics,London School of Economics; Ray Dalio is the Founder, Chairman, andCo-Chief Investment Officer at Bridgewater AssociatesUSA; and AxelWeber is the Chairman of UBS. Thank you so much, everyone, forjoining us.</p><p>Dr. Fang, let me kick it off with you. Given the prominence andimplications and impact that China has on the world, how can youassess, the global storage day. How would you say China is doingeconomically speaking?</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN OF CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORYCOMMISSION:  I think it's certain that the Chinese economy will slowdown a little bit this year and that's because of trade, because ofslowing down of the real estate market which is very much needed, bythe way.</p><p>But slowing down in China is not a collapse, right? So lastyear, we grew at 6.6 percent, this year, perhaps something aroundsix percent, let's say. And six percent is not very slow pace.</p><p>Now, the Chinese macro policies are very data dependent, I putit this way. So at this point, the government has already readied phquite a set ph strong of fiscal policy as well as monetary policy.</p><p>But if things continue to challenging going forward, on thefiscal side, there's a lot room to expand. Some people worry aboutthe overall debt in China. I think that, to the corporate sector, isa little bit too high. But the government sector can still leveragea lot and you're already seeing the local government issuing more ofwhat we call project bond, the central government hasn't done so.</p><p>The ability for the central government to borrow more is alsovery large. So the bottom line is that China is slowing down butit's not going to be a disaster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What areas would you say are seeing the mostslowdown? I mean, because you make such an important point. It wasthe slowest pace of growth, in three decades in 2018, and yet,country on the globe would love to say it is growing 6 percent. Socan you identify the specific industries that you believe areactually leading that slowdown?</p><p>FANG:  Well, export is, one example. The data from December, forexports, was not very encouraging. And we will see.</p><p>I mean, maybe it's a response to the trade dispute with theUnited States. It could be also an indication of global slowing downand we will see how this will unfold.</p><p>On the consumption side, last year, actually did quite well.But then, I mentioned, the real estate market because housing pricesare perhaps too high, and that squeezed a lot of money out ofhouseholds, squeezed consumption, right? So we need to do a lotabout housing.</p><p>And infrastructure is another area because a lot ofinfrastructures were done China by local governments. And during thelast few years, China has tightened up the implicit debt that localgovernments could borrow but we've expanded the explicit debt thatthe local government can borrow.</p><p>So there's a room there. We will see how the slowdown ofinfrastructure spending is dealt with this year. But again, theChinese macro policy is very, I would say, it's very responsive andalso is data dependent.</p><p>So as things unfold, we will respond accordingly and thecapacity for the Chinese government to respond to the economicslowdown is still very high. If anything, we should not overreact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ray Dalio, you have to allocate capital regardlessof the environment as the backdrop and you've been doing that foryears very effectively. In fact, even just in 2018, you were upalmost 15 percent in the face of all of what have we are talkingabout, increasing debt levels, global slowdown, and so many otherthings. Tell us how you see the backdrop and how you do allocatecapital in this environment?</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER/CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Well,let's say the backdrop, maybe I start with a template. I think overa period of time, there's productivity and the growth rate ofproductivity is the most important thing. You'll learn more, youinvent more, you become more efficient and that rises.</p><p>Then we have cycles around that. We have a normal businesscycles, short-term debt cycle and then there is a longer-term debtcycle which has to do with the capacity of leveraging up beinglimited when you approach zero interest rates or limitations interms of the effectiveness of quantitative easing.</p><p>So that framework is what I use when I'm looking at China, whenI'm looking at any country. I think we make bigger picture. I thinkwe are in the later stages of the short-term debt cycle. Meaning,maybe within the seventh or eighth inning of that and that there wasan inappropriate mistaken desire to tighten monetary policy at alevel that was faster than the capital markets could handle.</p><p>And as a result, we had a correction. We had 70 basis pointschange in rates, we had an important change in Fed policy regardingwhat the direction of Fed policy will be in that tightening. Butwe're in the later stages of the cycle when asset prices are fully-- were fully priced and still are somewhat fully priced.</p><p>I think the key question, like when we look at each country,when we look at China, look at Europe, look at the United States, wewill be in a slowing economic environment. That growth rate willslow and then probably in a self-reinforcing process.</p><p>I think -- but the question really is where the monetary policyis the nominated one-zone currency. These are all cycles. The cycle,like in China, I agree. It's one of those cycles people payattention to but they have the power, the debt is in currency, theycan handle that cycle.</p><p>But there is a weakening there. There is a slowing -- certainlya substandard growth rate in Europe and in the United States, therewill be a significant slowing in that particular period which shouldwarrant an easier monetary policy. The bigger issues, so these arethe cycles and then there's constraints of monetary policy for beingable to deal with that.</p><p>Then the bigger issues, really connected to politics and theeconomic policies associated with that. For example, when we cutcorporate taxes and we made interest rates low enough that it wasattractive to borrow, to buy financial assets, particularly buycompanies having mergers and conventions, that caused a lot ofgrowth in corporate debt and that growth in corporate debt was usedto finance those purchases which supported the financial markets.</p><p>So that is going to be less. So I think that probably nextyear, the slow up and then the beginning of thinking about politicsand what that might affect economic policy beyond, something likethe talk of the 70 percent income tax, for example, will play agreater role.</p><p>So I think that that's -- if I'm covering the world, U.S. andwe live in a world economy, U.S., Europe, China, all of those willbe experiencing a greater level of slowing, probably a greater levelof disappointment. And I think, there's this reasonable chance thatby the end of that, that that monetary policy and fiscal policy,they have to become easier relative to what is now discounted in themarkets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make such an important point. Becausefor a decade, we had such low interest rate, zero, and such easymonetary policy, not just in the United States but across the worldas you see that being removed, it has to be disruptive, right?</p><p>And I think at the end of the year, markets were reacting tothe unwind of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as much theraising of interest rates. So I ask you, do we even have the wiggleroom, if you will, in terms of cutting rates, where they are?</p><p>DALIO:  No. I think you could look at the level of interestrates and compare that to zero. And think about that times theduration of the assets and that is the power that you can have inhaving financial assets impacted by easing a monetary policy.</p><p>Then you have to ask yourself in terms of the balance sheets,how much can the balance sheets be increased, what would bepurchased and so on. So we -- what scares me the most longer term isthat we have limitations to monetary policy which is our mostvaluable tool. We have important limitations to the effectivenessthat at the same time as we have greater political and socialantagonism.</p><p>So the next downturn in the economy worries me the most. Ithink that there are a lot of parallels with the late 1930s. 1929 to'32, we had a debt crisis interest rates at zero. Then there was alot of printing of money, purchases of financial assets drivefinancial asset prices higher. Creates also a polarity, a populismand an antagonism.</p><p>We also had then at that time the phenomenon of a rising powerlike China dealing with the conflict of an existing power. Thesetypes of political issues are now very connected to economic issuesand policy. So I think that that's the character of theenvironment we're in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Weber, you ran the Bundesbank for a time. I wantto get your take on central bank policy as well. We also want to getinto your assessment of China.</p><p>In December, your firm announced you can in fact own a bank inChina. You announced this in December. So we'll get back to that.But first, assess the story as you heard Ray discuss in terms ofcentral banks and the ability to react to a slowdown at thisjuncture.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, SWISS INVESTMENT BANK:  So Ray made thevery important distinction between structure and business cycle andI think that's important. Structurally, interest rates in most ofthe western world as we bounce back from the financial crisis werevery low for very long and markets have gotten used to that.</p><p>I think actually rates for at least for the better half of thelast five years have been too low for the environment, for theeconomic environment we've been in. But, of course, Ray mentionedthe other point that central banks waited very long time justkeeping rates low because they were not gearing monetary policytowards the expected state of the economy and to the rebound ofgrowth but they were in a kind of insurance policy where they wantedto mitigate any tail risk and therefore, kept rates longer just toeliminate tail risk to the economy.</p><p>And, of course, when they started lifting rates, they tightenedrates in a late cycle stage. So the impact of that is that if youlook at monetary policy easing, which is if you look at the room tomaneuver, the only central bank that has any room to maneuver isactually the Federal Reserve.</p><p>If you look at traditional policy moves by the Fed, they lowerrates very frequently at relatively large steps of 50 basis point.The Fed can do a number of interest rate steps down if need be. SoI'm not worried about room to maneuver short term but as Ray alsosaid, given that we've had so low rates for long, the markethasn't really priced in much higher rates. If anything, the Fedhas come towards neutral. They're not quite as neutral but they'reclose to it.</p><p>And so, going back down is an emergency measure they can take.But I think it's more likely if you look at the year ahead thatthey're on pause now. I think we're going through a soft spot in theeconomy. Numbers have weakened, both in emerging markets and indeveloped markets over the (inaudible) and the first quarter.</p><p>We'll probably see a soft spot continuing into the firstquarter of this year. And then after the middle of the year, we havesome hope that that stuff might be behind us. And that's not thepoint where monetary policy moves from tightening to easing.That's the point where monetary policy takes a pause where theybecome data dependent, where they move into wait-and-see attitude.</p><p>I still have penciled in one or two rate hikes by the Fed overthis year. But I think they'll take a pause now. They'll look atthe data and if and when they resume, in my view, it won't be beforemidyear, and then I think the rest really very much depends on howthe current conflicts that we haven't yet talked about, the tailrisk like the trade war and some of the other tail risks, Brexit,how that affects the globe economy, what spillback is back into theU.S. and how monetary policy should react to that in the UnitedStates.</p><p>So I think central banks are on hold. The downside of centralbanks being on hold is the ECH will never even leave negativeterritory if they don't start raising rates this year. We stillthink there is some expectation that towards the end of the yearthey might do a 25 -- 20 basis basis point rate hike. But thechances with European data also coming in weaker. French data arelooking weaker. German data are looking weaker. Eurozone doesn'tlook very strong.</p><p>The expectation is still more likely to postpone that into nextyear. So I think, in general, monetary policy normalization is notan issue for this cycle. It's for the next cycle. They won't get itdone this time because the economy is weakening. And so, I think itwill be mission aborted.</p><p>They will look at normalizing rates in the next cycle and theyreact to a slowing economy over the next year or two by a more mutedand more cautious, more data-driven approach.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should the Fed slow down on the unwind? $50 billiona month is what the fed had signaled in terms of selling securities.</p><p>WEBER:  I think the unwind is less of an issue in the UnitedStates than it is in other constituencies because structurally, theFed used to have a balance sheet that was around 750 billion.</p><p>Long term, I don't think the Fed will go back to its old sizeof the balance sheet. The central bank's balance sheets would be amuch more central part of financial markets and they'd be a multipleof what we saw in central bank balance sheets then/</p><p>I think what the Fed needs to do is really look at sort of isthat different role that central banks now have in global economywhere markets are looking very much for monetary policy as veryoften the only game in town, is that the position central banks wantto be in?</p><p>Our Chinese friend just said the right thing, if you look atmacro policies, monetary policy can react quickly because it's doneby committee of elected bureaucrats. The real bigger impact you getfrom fiscal policy, it reacts slower, it needs to go throughparliament, decision likes are longer, but it's much more impactful.</p><p>And then the structural policies, don't forget the supply side.China is, at the moment, reacting with this demand side measuresboth easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economyagainst cooling. But the more important measures that China istaking is all the supply side reforms in open market. That creates alot of growth potential. That creates productivity enhancements. Andso, along what Ray said, we're too focused on managing demand andmanaging sort of cyclical movement. We should be lot more focused onlonger term structural issues in getting those right because I thinkthe other stuff is very much a distraction.</p><p>You can't spend time and money to cushion the economy againstthe downturn. But it's much better to enhance the growth potentialof the economies so that the downturn doesn't really need to such abig reset every time it happens and it happens time and again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. Let's stay on this point for a moment in termsof China and the structural changes that we're seeing and the impacton the rest of the world. Keyu, your thoughts.</p><p>KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LSE:  Let us be reminded that only twoyears ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb. Sowhat we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence ofthe government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>So if we look at the kind of deleveraging, the differentsectors, financial sectors deleveraging has been successful. Most ofthe debt to assets have stabilized. Household debt is increasing buthousehold debt was very low and one can argue too low for a while inChina.</p><p>So these efforts have made China financially much safer. And asa consequence, there will be a slowdown in economic growth, part ofit is, of course, kind of triggered by external factors. But much ofthis is the deliberate effort of the government to slow down thecredit growth, et cetera.</p><p>Now, of course, growth has now become more of an issue that thegovernment is always treading between -- the line between financialrisk and economic growth and now, they're shifting their focus moreon revamping the growth.</p><p>And as Dr. Fang has mentioned, China has a whole set -- theChinese government has a whole set of tools that are not normallyavailable to other economies whether it's the massive assets on thegovernment balance sheet or the huge amount of savings in China orjust the simply coordination, coordination of different state-ownedbanks and state-owned local governments. All these things matter.</p><p>That said, despite the fact that there are a lot of instrumentsto work with, I think China's main challenge is really how tounleash the real potential of the real economy. Right now, monetarypolicy is expanding. You're injecting more liquidity. You're pushingfor proactive fiscal policy and reducing taxes.</p><p>But the credit gets stuck in the financial sector. If itactually goes into the real economy, we are confident that theirreal big forces of positive changes for Chinese economy whether it'sentrepreneurship, it's innovation, the fact that services arerising, service productivity is rising, urbanization.</p><p>But the trouble is really the financial system and how to matchthe investment and savers and also give the household more abilityto consume, right? If you're -- if the real interest rate on bankdeposits, which most of the savings is stuck, is earning zero in thelast 10 years or 20 years while the economy is growing at six toeight percent, you're not giving that potential to the household andto the private sector. So it's all about unleashing the latentdynamism in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think the opening up of markets, do you thinkthis trade issue with the United States will in fact impact the realeconomy in China?</p><p>JIN:  I think that trade war has come as a benefit in disguisebecause it is serving as the external pressure for China toundertake some of these really important reforms. And as Axel hasmentioned, financial services has opened up where it's really kindof on schedule to open up vastly.</p><p>Consumers are now able to purchase many more goods from theU.S. and from the rest of the world. China needs competition. So thefinancial sector needs competition. It needs to be injected with newblood and it is such things that will help with that.</p><p>So opening up in general, which is consistent, with China'slonger-term goals, is simply accelerated by the recent trade war.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Fang, do you want to say something?</p><p>XINGHAI:  Yes. Yes. Dr. Weber had a very good point and that isas China right now seems to focus on macro demand management, thesupply side policy has not been stopped. We continued to pushforward for supply side well because of supply-side structuralreform.</p><p>And I'll give you a few examples. Opening up the financialsector for more international competition is one example and Dr.Weber can state (ph) to that. In the manufacturing sector, BASFrecently was given the opportunity to establish a 100 percent-ownedmassive petrochemical plant in China.</p><p>They used to be a 50/50 JV requirement and now this requirementis gone. China has reduced input duty in a very substantial way. Sothere's more competition in the consumer market.</p><p>So the supply-side policy continued and that's very importantpoint. And just to this audience, I want to say another word that is-- that China's vision for the economy is to make it open and largeand competitive. So it's not only an opportunity for the Chinesecompanies but it would also be a huge opportunity for all thecompanies from the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Ray, you've been in China for 30 years.You've been visiting there for 30 years. Axel, your firm justannounced you now own a financial institution that you own 51percent of, is that right?</p><p>WEBER:  Yes. We were the first bank that was offered a 51percent stake in a joint venture and we've executed that in Decemberand we now are the majority owner. We already had management controland we're now free to increase that stake further.</p><p>I think eventually as we invest in China and since our majorpartners are the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, there'slikely going to happen some delusion of our partners. And we'relooking into ways of raising capital also locally.</p><p>So there is welcome discussion between the Chinese authorities,much as with Hong Kong on the Shanghai-Hong Kong Bond Connect. Butalso, there was an ongoing discussion with London. I know that Dr.Fang is talking to the Swiss authorities.</p><p>So the more we can connect stock markets, the more we canactually be super connectors as international financial institutionsto bring international investors into the Chinese economy and helpChinese investors invest in the rest of the world.</p><p>And it's absolutely right what our Chinese colleagues havesaid, the Chinese economy needs competition and they're working, Ithink, on three legs of that. First is state-owned enterprise reformand I think that is very important and we've all gone through thatin Europe in the '90s of having former official sector conglomeratesmove to the private sector.</p><p>The second one is competition between state-owned enterprisesand private enterprises in China. And the third one is, and theauthority so far has been more cautious, opening up the Chineseeconomy for international competition because that will really be amajor contribution to increasing the competitiveness of companies.</p><p>And, of course, we as international experienced investors canhelp in that process and actually can help both Chinese investorsinternationally and international investors in China.</p><p>Just to give you an example, banks like UBS, we have 24 percentshare on the northbound traffic of the Asia market in the HongKong-Shanghai Stock Connect. So, we're kind of the go-to bank fora quarter of the investors into mainland China internationally.</p><p>Our market share for Chinese investors southbound (ph) is below1 percent. We're not the go-to bank for international investmentsfor Chinese citizens. And as we're granted majority rights aswe're investing in our business, we just doubled our headcount inChina over the last few years. We will become a major go-to partneralso for Chinese investors in the global economy, but that willhappen at a more measured pace because there is some concern inChina that this will impact on the exchange rate. So the opening-upprocess is more controlled, but it's happening.</p><p>Don't mistake speed for direction. The direction is veryclear. The speed, I think, has been really sort of increasedrecently. Actually, I was just in China in the first weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>WEBER:  The constructive dialogues we had with Chinese authorityis really on a totally different page today than it was a few yearsago. So I'm very confident about this process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget of top 20 banks in the world, thetop five are Chinese.</p><p>Ray?</p><p>DALIO:  Well, you mentioned I've been there 30 years andI've watched it evolved. And I think there are two types of thingsthat are going on. Let's call them the short-term and thelong-term, right?</p><p>As I said, productivity is the big thing in the long-term, andthat's a real big thing. Then you have the short-term debt cyclesand you have the short-term thing. So the two things that arehappening short-term is that you are having deleveraging that you soarticulately dealt with. There was an overleveraging and there was adevelopment of the financial markets.</p><p>Not long ago, it was really five or six years ago, five majorbanks loaned money to state-owned enterprises and the money wasclogged at the top. Then there was the development of the shadowbanking system and the liberalization of that and now put into placeregulation. Whenever you're having a deleveraging, that issomething that makes the country healthier because you'redeleveraging, but it has short-term effect, but it has a long-termpositive. So there's the deleveraging happening. It's ashort-term thing. And then there's the trade issues associatedwith that, which is also a short-term thing.</p><p>But if you take productivity growth, if you take the approach,I think it really has to be admired as Chinese characteristics asit's described. It's a cultural challenge for the West, butthere's a top-down way of setting a mission for 2025 plan or aplan and working those things in the top-down way with uniqueresources available that has produced in the time that I've beenthere an increase of 20 times in incomes. It used to be the belowpoverty level. The 88 percent of the population was below povertylevel. Today it's less than 1 percent.</p><p>There is an ability to produce productivity, but it's aculture clash with the West, in some ways, because as one of theleaders described it to me, the United States is a country ofindividualists. An individual is working that up. China is more of acountry that is an extension of the model of the family. And hedescribed, he said, \"There is the word 'country', in China,represents state family.\" And if you go back to Confucianism and howit is run top-down, and that is where there is an element of aculture clash.</p><p>At the same time, when you look at that productivity and thepolicies and things, it's a very effective place. So, I would sayit's important to distinguish the short-term influences fromlonger-term productivity influences and then recognize that we'rein a world where there is a competition and that could mean conflictin different dimensions between the two countries. That means, Ithink the trade issue is a manageable issue.</p><p>I think the way of being issue is a challenging issue becauseAmericans can't expect Chinese to operate in a way that isdifferent from that or vice versa. So I think that's the biggerlong-term issue, but I think you'd have to be very optimistic whenyou think of even a 5 percent or a 6 percent growth rate and whatthat's going to mean and what the world will look like in 10 or 20years. It will be quite a different world in which China is going tobe, I think, a lot stronger. So I think that's the picture.Let's not confuse the short-term with that bigger picture,evolutionary picture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about the picture of debt? I mean, howworried should we be about debt, particularly, the U.S. has to selldebt. China, obviously, one of the biggest, most significant holdersof the US' debt. Are any of these issues, Dr. Fang, in terms ofthe trade spat, in terms of slowing growth in China are the biggestsignificant holders of the U.S. debt are any of these issues, interms of the trade spat in terms of slowing growth in China, arethey impacting capital flows?</p><p>XINGHAI:  China will continue to be what we call a \"savingssurplus country\" for some time, although the saving is declining,but it will be a saving surplus country. So we have to investabroad. The U.S. government bond market turns out to be a good placeto invest, so I don't think China will, in any way, significantlyreduce its investment into the U.S. government bond market.</p><p>But on the other hand, in terms of capital flow, we do open up.We want more companies from different sectors to come into China, sothat should increase capital inflows. We want to increase both way.</p><p>Maria, I want to add one point to what Ray Dalio just saidabout the culture shock, right? China does have different approachto economic management. And I think at this world, perhaps we shouldlearn from each other a little bit. And I want to give you oneexample how we manage our financial risk.</p><p>Over the last 40 years, China hasn't had a very significantfinancial crisis, for example, and that's very rare among thedeveloping world. And I used to work for the World Bank and we havefinancial crisis in developing countries a lot. And how China hasbeen able to avoid financial crisis, right, in the last 40 years,well, we have a very top-down approach to financial risk management,and that is the a central government constantly is in touch with thefinancial sector, get information from the financial sector in atimely manner. And if there's any risk accumulating the system,the government will step in and order the risk to be reduced.</p><p>Now, of course, sometimes we will still miss something, right?So occasionally we have certain financial jitteries in the market.But once we have that financial jittery, our system is able to reactto these jitteries in a very quick way, and we move quickly tocontain the risk so that the risk does not spread into the entiresystem and it does not create panic in the system. And then as theeconomy grows the risk is diluted going forward, so that's how wehave been able to grow our economy by so much and grow the financialsystem by so much without incurring a major financial risk. Sothere's some lesson there, I think, that the rest of the worldperhaps should take a look at.</p><p>WEBER:  I think, if I may, there's also a point of no returnin this whole thing about opening up for China because you have tolook at China's weight in the global economy has really increasedmassively. China is bordering on to at least 20 percent weight inthe global economy. If you look at exports, if you look at globalgrowth, still today, most of the growth that we see globally isgenerated by China's inclusion into world economy.</p><p>Now, that is reflected by now putting China a lot more intoportfolios because you can't just have a big part of the globaleconomy with Chinese, and investors completely haves zero exposureto that growth in their portfolio. So China gets inclusions intoindices, like the MSCI, in the equity indices or in the bond indiceslike the Bloomberg Index. Our estimate is, over the next quarters,there will be 250 billion of capital inflows into China, basicallyjust by this 4 percent weight that China will get.</p><p>Now, so far Ray is absolutely right, China debt is not aproblem because it's largely domestically held. Domestic policiesand redistribution of their debt can easily be engineered bypolicymakers.</p><p>International investors, if they invest in China debt orequity, they want different standards. They want accountingstandards. They want very clear, solid products to invest in. So,what is happening is that will raise the standards and the bars forequity markets in China because you need to bring internationalinvestors in and you also need to allow, because you just don'twant a big inflow into the Chinese economy that puts upward pressureon the exchange rate, you need to open up and sync internationalinvestments for your citizens to invest into rest of the world soyou create capital outflows.</p><p>So in the future, the whole debate about QFII and QDII quotaswill be a lot more interlinked because large banks like us whocompete at the top level for Chinese clients will have to do both,only if our action is not just one-sided by bringing internationalcapital in. But also having Chinese invest abroad, we will not havean impact in what we do on policy preferences like no impact on theexchange rate. So I think there is a point of no return where yousimply once you open up, you get included in this index, you getdrawn into the global economy, and that's where I think you reallyneed to do the supply-side reforms to do that in a more resilientmanner.</p><p>So, I'm not worried about the sort of credit cycling inChina, at the moment, because the Chinese Central Bank can reallycreate a lot more monetary stimulus without even touching interestrates. Reserve requirements are at -- 23 percent, I think, is thelast number I saw. You can massively reduce reserve requirements fordomestic banks and create credit origination without really doinganything, so the interest rate (inaudible).</p><p>XINGHAI:  On this point of no return of opening up, the mainreason is that is opening up is good for China.</p><p>WEBER:  Sure.</p><p>XINGHAI:  You mentioned the Asia inclusion into the MSCI Index,and the effect of that inclusion is already felt in the Chinesemarket in terms of raising the quality of the market because we nowhave to respond to the demand of the international institutionalinvestors.</p><p>So just give you a very concrete example, in the Shanghai StockExchange, we used to calculate the closing price of a stock by itslast trade, and that's not very good for international investors.Now, according to their request, we have changed that into theaverage price of the last three minutes in a concentrated tradingmanner. And now it's much better according to the internationalinvestors. So this is just very small example of how opening up hasbeen good for China, and we will continue to do that.</p><p>KEYU:  I would like to push back on a little bit at this point.If we look back, maybe 200 years back, this century's financialhistory might well be written by China.</p><p>Now, it's not just a question whether China is ready or notfor opening up, and here we're talking not just about opening upto trade, but opening up capital accounts and exchange rateflexibility. The question is, is the world ready?</p><p>Let us be reminded that China is still a developing countrywith a financial system with a whole array of issues. Because of theweight, it has an economy because even so far it hasn't opened upthe financial linkages, but when it does, all of its volatility inChina will transmit to the world in much greater proportions thatwe've seen. 2015, 2017, these were small movements in China andthey sent jitters to the financial markets.</p><p>Now, imagine a really open Chinese market. The point behindthis is should China not consider domestic financial reforms, sortits domestic issues first before thinking about really wide-scaleopening up, in which case the financial linkages would be muchstronger. So the world also needs to understand that the secondlargest economy in the world and the ones that's going to betransmitting the volatility is still a developing country. That'sthe first point.</p><p>The second is we've talked about how most of us agree thatthe debt problems in China are within management. I would saydefinitely the same, but it's really about how this debt is usedand how this credit is used.</p><p>Since 2009, the RMB4 trillion fiscal stimulus has led to agross misallocation of resources, so it's not so much the level ofdebt, the amount of credit in the economy, but where it is going. Isit just going to big SOEs, low-productivity firms, infrastructureprojects or is this credit channeled to productive parts of thesector? Now, if a misallocation of resources can be reduced thenthere's enormous potential for China to continue to grow.</p><p>Lastly, I want to point to two facts that we've recentlyseen. For the first time in decades, in the first half of 2018,China is now importing more from the world than its exporting.It's running a current account deficit. That has hugeimplications.</p><p>Now two gentlemen on my left have talked about low interestrates, about challenges to monetary policy, both in Europe and theU.S. China will serve as a main source of aggregate demand whereaggregate demand, as we have seen, is very lacking in the rest ofthe world. Inflation was not come up. Interest rates are still atrecord low levels. China will potentially be an important source ofaggregate demand going forward now that it's importing more. So,pushing for a divorce with China is not necessarily a good idea.</p><p>XINGHAI:  Keyu reminded me as a regulator of ourresponsibilities, right? Because as China draws more capital intoits financial market, the jitteries inside China can have a hugeimpact in the international world. And we have raised ourcapabilities to do a better job.</p><p>DALIO:  I think we also have to look at what's happening inlight of the rises and declines of reserve currencies in the worldand the normal patterns. And if you look at it, from the Dutchguilder, the British pound and the U.S. dollar, and now China andhow countries evolve and you look at those patterns over a series ofhistory, we know that, first of all, technology is the leadingreason for the developments.</p><p>We know that each of those countries has to go global withtheir currency and their banks. We know that they have to bedeveloped their financial markets. Every one of those has had afinancial center. Amsterdam was, London was, New York was, and nowin China, they must have their financial markets.</p><p>We know that that opening up helps their balance of payments,and it also helps the development of the renminbi as a reservecurrency, the going global of China. That will happen, that's aninevitable part of the development.</p><p>Simultaneously though, we have to look at the United States andwe have to think of its implications. There was a cycle that thishappens. The rises of these reserve currencies happen because thecountries become more competitive, technologies and all thosethings, balance of payments and they go global.</p><p>The declines of world reserve currencies happen quite oftenbecause they have reserve currencies. There's a lot of lending tothem. And in the United States, we have to talk about the UnitedStates and the United States debt, government debt. We're talkinga lot about China, and that's part of that puzzle, a big part ofthat puzzle. But we also have a real problem in terms of thequantity of debt that we're going to have to sell to the rest ofthe world over the next few years.</p><p>We have experienced a lot of stimulation because of acombination of the tax cuts and the stimulation. If you do theprojections, the pro forma projections and think who's going tobuy that amount of debt and the amount of debt that we have to sell,I think that that's going to be an issue. So when we're talkingabout the balance, I think the normal evolution will beglobalization in which I would characterize China as basicallyallowing very free markets, in many ways, within boundaries and thennot to let it go outside of that boundary of volatility. So, if Iwas to take a foreign exchange policy, you will have more freedombut you'll have boundaries so it can't go beyond thoseboundaries, which I think is a good thing.</p><p>But you're going to have that globalization, you're goingto have the development of the currency and there is a problem or achallenge in terms of debt, which relates to the currency issue,because a bond is a promise to deliver a lot of currency. It justbasically a pile of currency spread over a period of time. And Iwould say that if you were to take a longer-term perspective, two orthree or four years that that's going to be an issue. And so I dothink that capital flows and the nature of that balance of paymentsissue is going to be a factor in the years ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to comment on that, Dr. Fang, before wemove on? I want to get questions from the audience and I do want toturn back to Europe, but first can you respond to what Ray justpresented?</p><p>FANG:  Yeah. Essentially, what Ray said is that the Chineseeconomy is so large, so whatever happens in China, it has a lot ofimpact on the world. And as we draw capital in, there will becapital flowing out.</p><p>I think one of the lessons that China learned over the last fewyears is that we know that we are a large economy so our impact onthe rest of the world is something that we have to take into accountand we make policies. So we want to make sure that the policychanges in China, as well as the economic variable changes in China,is not so large because if it's very big it's kind of verysteep, it's going to have a very big impact on the rest of theworld. And we understand that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Fang, let me ask you before we close the loop onthis subject. Obviously, opening up the markets in China appears tobe a priority ...</p><p>FANG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... for the Chinese leadership ...</p><p>FANG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... and to the rest of the world.</p><p>FANG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is the force transfer oftechnology and I.P. theft?</p><p>FANG:  I'm not an expert in this area. We are against forcedtechnology transfer and I.P. theft. Of course, it's not somethingthat we would like to see. I think we can sit down and talk aboutthese things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that be something as far as part of a dealwith the United States that you would try to make progress on thoseissues?s</p><p>FANG:  We are willing to talk to the United States on everyissue that the U.S. raises.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And our overall objective is to have a cooperative relations ineconomics as well as in other areas with the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is such a rich topic. We can continue talkingabout it, but I want to hear from all of you because we have suchinformed and experienced group in the audience. Yes, Sir, righthere.</p><p>Please say who you are. And by the way, this is beinglive-streamed on Top Link World Economic Forum as well as on FoxBusiness. You should know that. I wanted to say that from thebeginning.</p><p>Please, Sir, go ahead.</p><p>ANTHONY HOBLEY:  Thank you. My name is Anthony Hobley. I'm theCEO of the Carbon Tracker Initiative. I guess, we're amission-driven, philanthropically-funded investment bank analysts.</p><p>The title of this session is \"Rethinking Global FinancialRisk.\" In the WEF survey that just came out of global risks, likethree or four out of top five is climate change. So why hasn't theC word or double C word even come up in this is conversation? Isthis what Mark Carney said it's the tragedy of the horizons? SoMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.</p><p>We've just had last week, I think, PG&amp;E now the CaliforniaUtility Company put itself into Chapter 11 to protect itself fromthe liabilities from the wildfires, which has been exacerbated byclimate change. So, I guess, my question to the panel is whenyou're talking about rethinking global financial risk, and thecommunity that makes up WEF thinks that's one of the biggestissues of three or four of the biggest issues in the world, whyhaven't you even raised that as part of this conversation?</p><p>DALIO:  I think there are a number of issues that we haven'traised in a limited amount of time. But I mean, of course, that'sgoing to be a big business issue. I think that's correct. Wedidn't deal with the wealth gap, and we didn't deal with thetechnologies, and we didn't deal with the artificial intelligence,and we didn't deal with a whole laundry list of important things,limited amount of time. And I guess, we became more focused onChina, but it is an important issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we will touch as well on Brexit because this isanother uncertainty in Europe. How much of an issue are the issuesin Europe as impacting the rest of the world? Very quickly.</p><p>WEBER:  Well, I think it's an unfolding story. And last year,I remember when everyone sort of felt that the sky was the limit andthere was a huge sort of common belief that things could only getbetter. This year I think the mood is a bit too gloomy.</p><p>I still have firm beliefs that policymakers are elected toprovide solutions. Sometimes it's a winding road, sometimes thereare setbacks, so this has been a pretty volatile evolving situation.I think ultimately it is not in anybody's interest to have anunorderly Brexit without new rules of the game being defined. Ifthat requires because they started late and they didn't gaintraction and they didn't agree early, that requires more time tonegotiate. It's the rationale thing to do.</p><p>I think creating domestic acceptance for a deal you're aboutto sign is as important as having the other side agree to that dealwith you. And so I think the Commission and everyone should givethemselves the time in order to mitigate what is a tail risk forEurope.</p><p>I don't see calendar and basically triggering exit withoutreally having the solution as a wise strategy. I didn't think thatit was a wise strategy at the time. I think we're starting to seethat the clock is running out. And the obvious thing for me to dowhen that is the case and you're not done is you should stop theclock and stop negotiations only then when you got a deal.</p><p>I think an unorderly Brexit in nobody's interest, and I takesome reassurance by the fact that the British parliament is moredeeply involved now in these discussions because, ultimately, theparliament has made clear that we want to move to a new stage wherewe want to do that in an orderly way. And not doing it without adeal is not something that is the preference of many (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think Britain leaves the European Union, butthey will not do it in a hard way, they will do it with awell-thought-out trade situation with partners?</p><p>WEBER:  I've have been in so many financially rescues 10 yearsago. I always look at very difficult situation at one o'clock atnight. By two o'clock when the Japanese markets opened, we neededa solution. Usually that last hour was where most of the thingsmoved, so we're still almost 60 days away from that March enddate. And I think there will be some own dynamics in this.</p><p>In the end, I think people have to start making compromises.It's OK to insist on your position if you're negotiating, but inthe end if you want to deal, everyone needs to compromise. Ihaven't seen the compromises on the table so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get as many questions as we can. And goahead, Sir.</p><p>BRUJIS:  My name is Marcos Brujis. I'm the Chief Executive ofthe IFC Asset Management Company, International Finance Corporation.</p><p>One thing that we've seen in China is that reserves have gonedown from around $4 billion in 2014 to ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Four trillion.</p><p>BRUJIS:  ... $4 trillion 2014, 2015. They are now below three,so it's ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Slightly above that.</p><p>BRUJIS:  ... more than a trillion has been spent. A lot of thismoney has been spent through some of these sovereign and quasisovereign wealth funds, SAVE (ph), CIC (ph), the money that wentinto AAAB (ph). And a lot of this money has gone to very riskymarkets. OK. I'm originally from Latin America, so I've beenworried when I've seen some of that money go into Venezuela, whichif you ask me, it's going to be hard to collect, let's put itmildly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUJIS:  My question to the panel is, if as a result of thesevery aggressive investments in very difficult markets in Africa, inSouth Asia that not all of them will go great, if you will see thatChina will, all of a sudden, begin borrowing a little bit in theUnited States style in order to continue funding, for example, itsBelt and Road initiative?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Comment?</p><p>FANG:  Well, I think, $3 trillion, we are still slightly above$3 trillion. And $3 trillion is perhaps more than enough, right, asforeign currency reserve. Now, of course, we can always make betteruse of the foreign currency reserve that we have, and you pointedout Venezuela or these countries, whether China is using its foreigncurrency reserve wisely or not, well, it remains to be seen, right?It still needs some more time, but we can always make improvement inthese aspects.</p><p>KEYU:  Fifteen years ago, the people were complaining that Chinawas purchasing U.S. treasuries and losing money, and they had to gofor higher return, more diversified assets. And you're seeing theconsequence of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Sir?</p><p>MARINA (?):  My name is Gilberto Marina (ph), the President of(inaudible). I would like to hear some comments about if they'vereduced some risks in Latin America, especially in Brazil andMexico?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great question and we will hear from the newPresident of Brazil at the World Economic Forum today at 3:30.Comments about Latin America?</p><p>DALIO:  I think that the cycle in Brazil has been a good cyclein terms of the changes. Terrible balance payments, it becameexpensive. It was bank subsidies by the government, a number ofthings that created the classic balance payments crisis, classicdebt crisis in which then the exchange rate became very cheap. Andyou had then the funding and it became somewhat attractive to investin. And now we're dealing with the political questions that willcome out of that.</p><p>So I would say, by and large, it's on a good track, but thereare questions in terms of pension reforms, political reforms,corruption issues. All of those enter into a picture of what Brazilwill look like coming forward, so I would say on a good track, butthere's a lot to be seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we'll see what Mr. Bolsonaro says today fromhere in Davos.</p><p>Yes, Sir? Jacob?</p><p>FRENKEL:  Thank you. I'm Jacob Frenkel, Chairman of JPMorganChase International. First of all, it was a fantastic panel.</p><p>It was taken for granted that the U.S. is ahead of the game interms of recovery, but I want to make sure that we recognize thatit's not just a cycle and we just need to wait and everything elsewill happen. It was the result of policies</p><p>There is a consensus. The reason why U.S. performance has beenso positive, it reflects the corporate tax reform, it reflectspolicies concerning the trapped capital, it reflects thederegulation, it reflects the (inaudible) business and the like. Soit's not a political the same but a statement that says, you wantto see results, you better do some policies and it is the corporatesector that does the growth. Therefore, it needs to be not be theenemy but the partner.</p><p>Having said all of this and given that there are so many othersessions, still there is one overwhelming subject of risk that we donot have a good systemic answer to, and it has to do with the cyber.We do not have the international agreements about it and the like,and that's something with all of us are really losing sleep about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Jacob. As we wrap up, let me justreiterate some of the points that were made on this panel. It doesappear that we are in a slowing economic environment, although Dr.Fang mentions that 6 percent growth is still quite attractive. Andalso, Keyu made the point that China will ultimately be the solutionfor the world in terms of demand and the place that we will see manyimports coming in. China is now importing more last year than itactually exported.</p><p>Ray Dalio made a very important point in terms of capital flowsand what your perception is in terms of, as this deleveraging goeson in China, what the impact will be on the dollar. It sounds likeyou will have concerns there.</p><p>You made the point on Brexit and the point on the Europeansituation is what, that you believe Brexit will take place, but youdo believe calmer heads will prevail and it will not be a hard exit?</p><p>WEBER:  At least I hope so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You'll never know. I mean, but I think it would be completelyirrational to let the situation get out of hand. Europe has beenchallenged last decade with homemade problems.</p><p>If you look at France, if you look at Germany, there are majorleadership issues in all of our countries. And adding Brexit as auncontrollable risk to that mix, we just said you're back foryears to come. So I think it's in nobody's interest to really doa hasty exit without an organized deal. So, yes, I hope and Ibelieve that policymakers will have second thoughts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you to ourdistinguished panel. Have a good day.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED:  A very interesting panel we've been listeningto over the last hour from Davos, Switzerland. The title of thepanel, \"Rethinking Global Financial Risk.\" Maria Bartiromo, ofcourse, leading that discussion, and there was a lot of talk, ofcourse, about global economies and trade and a lot of talk aboutChina.</p><p>We were obviously listening to those comments from Axel Weber,the UBS Chairman, about Brexit. He was saying, of course, he wouldlike to see and hopes and believes that we will have orderly Brexit.But also I thought a lot of the interesting discussion is aboutChina, about the economy. Six percent from that regulatory officialfrom China, Fang Xinghai, talking about 6 percent global growth inChina, and also the issue of the Chinese economy that the womanthere, Jin Keyu, Harvard educated, we should say, talked about thefact that she believes that the Chinese will continue to buy debtfrom the United States. And that will be good news for the U.S. bondmarket, Lori.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  To quote her, she is a professor at the London Schoolof Economics as well, Jin Keyu. She also said the trade war is abenefit in disguise for China because of that external pressure forthem to open up their economy and make some needed reforms</p><p>And to talk about all of this and much more, we bring in AltiumWealth Market Strategist, Michael Lee, and Nova Point Capital'sChief Investment Officer, Joe Sroka. Gentlemen, thank you forsticking with us, for listening in.</p><p>I want to start with you, Michael, and let's begin withChina.</p><p>Mr. Fang said that Chinese economy will slow, but it will notcollapse. And Maria Bartiromo asked very pointedly, \"You seem to bevery willing to open up your economy, willing to do that, but whatabout Chinese leadership making it a priority to addressintellectual property theft? And he really skirted that answer,Michael.</p><p>LEE:  Yeah, absolutely, probably the funniest point of theentire hour presentation. But look, who would have thought that itwould be Trump to force the Chinese to open up their markets. Ithink they've known they needed to do this for a long time, buthe's very much accelerated the process by putting all sorts ofexternal pressure on them.</p><p>China has a real issue in turning their populace into aconsumption nation, and opening up their markets for direct foreigninvestments so you can have wealth accumulation not by those at thetop will make a huge difference for them. As you heard from everyoneon the panel, the key for China going forward is to open up theirmarkets. And so China right now is -- what there is no mention of isthat they are a communist nation and they are the number one enemyof the ...</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2169251646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V84-V5T1-DY0W-40C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Jan 22, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Cambridge Analytica</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>UBS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Switzerland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dalio, Ray</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Investments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Interest rates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet access</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet stocks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tariffs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU membership</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic summit conferences</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 518210</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 541618</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 541820</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 522110</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 523110</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 523120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 523920</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 523930</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 518210</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 519130</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

These are of course legitimate questions, but we don't hear so much about China, which combines astonishing ingenuity with the ability to process data on a vast scale without the legal and regulatory constraints on privacy and data protection that we require on both sides of the Atlantic.\" [Reference Link]:[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-lobbyist-nick-clegg-europe-should-worry-about-china-internet-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-lobbyist-nick-clegg-europe-should-worry-about-china-internet-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T</url>?]|</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-336176339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9K-NNN1-DYWB-B3GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"182\"/><timeReceived>6:37 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheFlyOnTheWall.com</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook is under pressure[2] from several quarters, including the Russia investigations and European tax authorities. The revelations that Russia linked fake accounts purchased $100,000 worth of ads which\u00a0reached 10 million Americans and was targeted at swing states with propaganda on everything from race to guns to gay rights has been a major blow to Facebook's reputation.Given the multiple controversies, FB stock has hit a break[3] after 50% rally. Facebook stock has not gone anywhere since the end of July. However, in the last couple of weeks, Facebook stock has shown some signs of building momentum, gaining over 5%. FB stock is back above its 20-day moving average support\u00a0line while MACD has made a bullish crossover. The question now is, can the recently gained momentum sustain going into the earnings? </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://amigobulls.com/stocks/FB/stockcharts?cq=Q09NUFg6UHJpY2UsRkI6UHJpY2UmcmFuZ2U9MU0mc2Q9MjAxNy0wOC0wMSZlZD0yMDE3LTEwLTEw...=il\">https://amigobulls.com/stocks/FB/stockcharts?cq=Q09NUFg6UHJpY2UsRkI6UHJpY2UmcmFuZ2U9MU0mc2Q9MjAxNy0wOC0wMSZlZD0yMDE3LTEwLTEw...=il</url> Controversies continue to remain a headwind.The controversies around Facebook refuse to die down. In fact, it seems like the social media giant is getting embroiled in different controversies every other day. Facebook found itself in another Russia related controversy recently. According to James Lankford, a senator from Oklahoma,\u00a0last month Russian internet trolls sought to stir up passions in a debate over American football players kneeling in protest during the national anthem. Facebook is trying to convince Congress that it can get things under control. It has announced guidelines which will make it harder for malicious actors to buy political advertising and conduct misinformation campaigns. It will now require its advertisers to post all of the ads they are running to promote transparency and has plans to hire 1,000 more moderators to review their content. However, several lawmakers are yet to buy Facebook's argument and are proposing regulations relating to political ads on social media.There are also increasing number of voices calling for regulating internet behemoths such as Facebook and Google like a utility while some others are calling for anti-trust actions against these tech giants terming them as monopolies[4]. The support for regulation of big tech companies is bipartisan. Steve Bannon and Bernie Sanders both\u00a0want big tech companies treated as public utilities. Senator Warren has accused big tech giants like Facebook of using their size to \"snuff out competition.\" Is Facebook Inc a media company?Facebook is facing similar regulatory pressure in Europe. Britain is looking to regulate Facebook and Google as new publishers[5] and not just platforms,\u00a0meaning they\u00a0could be held responsible for the content and regulated like traditional news providers, according\u00a0to a spokesman of Prime Minister Theresa May.\u00a0A report on Tuesday by consultants Enders Analysis said that 6.5 million British internet users claimed to mainly source their news from Facebook. U.K is also looking to force social media companies like Facebook to reveal \"the scale of cyber bullying in the U.K. and face being made to pay the cost of dealing with it\".\u00a0Under the latest guidance by the U.K. government, technology companies will be required to publish an annual report on how they handle complaints and the extent of their efforts to moderate bullying or offensive content about children, women, gay people or religions. There is also a proposal of \"industry-wide levy\" on social media companies to raise awareness about cyberbullying and counter internet harms.Taxing Time Ahead For Facebook Stock?And to top it all, the European Commission is looking at hitting Facebook and Google with heftier tax bills. There are arguments for imposing a tax on revenue\u00a0rather than profits of the digital industry by mid-2018. \"I favor imposing immediate levies, similar to sales tax, but only as a temporary solution before we reach a global agreement.\"\u00a0French finance minister, Le Maire said during\u00a0a meeting.\u00a0Under the proposed plan, companies would have to pay taxes on revenues in the country where they do business instead of the current setup, which only requires firms to pay taxes on profit that they report in what are often low-tax countries. Tech companies could see a hefty increase in their tax bills under the new proposal, which will hit their bottom line.Facebook stock remains a good long term buy.Given the plethora of regulatory uncertainties and the negative sentiment, Facebook stock is likely to remain under pressure going into the Q3 earnings. The fact that, Facebook\u00a0management has warned about the slowdown in the second half of the year is also not helping the sentiments. This is not to say that investors should sell Facebook stock. Facebook has several long-term growth drivers[6] and is investing heavily in videos which could another growth driver. Facebook stock remains a good long term buy[7]. However, regulatory uncertainty could keep Facebook stock in check in the short term. Looking for fundamentally better tech stocks?

Facebook has issued the threat in response to a proposed law that would see Facebook and Google  forced to pay Australian media organisations for hosting their content.   \u201cAssuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d  a statement from Facebook \u2018s Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton said.   \u201cThis is not our first choice \u2013 it is our last.   \u201cBut it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic  and will hurt, not help, the long term vibrancy of Australia\u2019s news and media sector.\u201d   Mr Easton took aim at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which developed the draft code, accusing it of ignoring the role social media plays in promoting journalism.   He argued that in the first five months of 2020, users had clicked on Australian news items shared on the platform 2.3 billion times, which the company said generated $200 million in revenue for Australian media organisations.   \u201cWhen crafting this new legislation, the commission overseeing the process ignored important facts, most critically the relationship between the news media and social media and which one benefits most from the other,\u201d Mr Easton said.   \u201cNews represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.\u201d   It is understood Facebook is still working through how any news ban would be implemented.   In response, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused Facebook of making \u201cheavy   handed threats\u201d in an attempt to get its way.   \u201cAustralia makes laws that advance our national interest. We don\u2019t respond to coercion or heavy handed threats wherever they come from,\u201d he said.   \u201cOur reforms to digital platforms are world leading and follow a ground-breaking 18-month inquiry by the ACCC.   \u201cThese reforms will help to create a more sustainable media landscape and see payment for original content.\u201d   Facebook has also updated its terms of service, which come into effect next month.   Under the changes, Facebook would reserve the right to block information that could lead to \u201cregulatory impacts\u201d on it.   \u201cWe also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\u201d  Code sparks ire of tech giants  Google has already launched a strong opposition campaign to the laws,  pushing an open letter onto its users .   In the letter, Google argues its free services in Australia, such as its search engine and YouTube, could be under threat.   The media has long argued companies such as Facebook and Google benefit from the work of journalists, without paying for access to those stories or sharing any advertising revenue from their platforms.   The Government says its proposed laws are essential for creating a level playing field between local media and big internet companies.   Under the laws, Facebook and Google would be forced to negotiate payments with Australian media companies for their content.   If no agreement can be reached, they could be forced into an arrangement.   The code would also require Google and Facebook to give advance notice of any changes to their algorithms that could impact how news content was displayed.   It would also set a standard for how Google and Facebook shared data relating to how users accessed news content.   The ACCC had lashed out at claims made by Google it would have to start charging for its services, arguing that would only be as a result of the company\u2019s own choices.   It also denied suggestions tech companies would be forced to hand over user data to media companies.   Public consultation on the code closed on Friday, with the Government now considering the feedback.   \u2013 ABC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42970381417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-4YX1-JCSC-J0GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The New Daily</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook has issued the threat in response to a proposed law that would see Facebook and Google  forced to pay Australian media organisations for hosting their content.   \u201cAssuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d  a statement from Facebook \u2018s Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton said.   \u201cThis is not our first choice \u2013 it is our last.   \u201cBut it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic  and will hurt, not help, the long term vibrancy of Australia\u2019s news and media sector.\u201d   Mr Easton took aim at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which developed the draft code, accusing it of ignoring the role social media plays in promoting journalism.   He argued that in the first five months of 2020, users had clicked on Australian news items shared on the platform 2.3 billion times, which the company said generated $200 million in revenue for Australian media organisations.   \u201cWhen crafting this new legislation, the commission overseeing the process ignored important facts, most critically the relationship between the news media and social media and which one benefits most from the other,\u201d Mr Easton said.   \u201cNews represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.\u201d   It is understood Facebook is still working through how any news ban would be implemented.   In response, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused Facebook of making \u201cheavy   handed threats\u201d in an attempt to get its way.   \u201cAustralia makes laws that advance our national interest. We don\u2019t respond to coercion or heavy handed threats wherever they come from,\u201d he said.   \u201cOur reforms to digital platforms are world leading and follow a ground-breaking 18-month inquiry by the ACCC.   \u201cThese reforms will help to create a more sustainable media landscape and see payment for original content.\u201d   Facebook has also updated its terms of service, which come into effect next month.   Under the changes, Facebook would reserve the right to block information that could lead to \u201cregulatory impacts\u201d on it.   \u201cWe also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\u201d  Code sparks ire of tech giants  Google has already launched a strong opposition campaign to the laws,  pushing an open letter onto its users .   In the letter, Google argues its free services in Australia, such as its search engine and YouTube, could be under threat.   The media has long argued companies such as Facebook and Google benefit from the work of journalists, without paying for access to those stories or sharing any advertising revenue from their platforms.   The Government says its proposed laws are essential for creating a level playing field between local media and big internet companies.   Under the laws, Facebook and Google would be forced to negotiate payments with Australian media companies for their content.   If no agreement can be reached, they could be forced into an arrangement.   The code would also require Google and Facebook to give advance notice of any changes to their algorithms that could impact how news content was displayed.   It would also set a standard for how Google and Facebook shared data relating to how users accessed news content.   The ACCC had lashed out at claims made by Google it would have to start charging for its services, arguing that would only be as a result of the company\u2019s own choices.   It also denied suggestions tech companies would be forced to hand over user data to media companies.   Public consultation on the code closed on Friday, with the Government now considering the feedback.   \u2013 ABC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42970120612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-4YX1-JCSC-J0BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The New Daily</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Think of data as water, precious yet imperfectly valued. Big tech groups such as Facebook grab the headlines for aggregating so much of it. Yet those purveying financial markets information are amassing equivalent clout. Regulators worry that investors are being ripped off. Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-markets-data/british-watchdog-enters-tug-of-war-over-market-data-idUKKBN20W0P7?il=0\"> launched</url> a review on Monday.\u00a0</p><p>The probe should prompt heart-searching at London Stock Exchange Group. Shrewd acquisitions are turning Gorgonzola Hall, as the bourse was known in Victorian times, into a vertically integrated data power house. The $27bn proposed purchase of Refinitiv is the latest flourish. It should add a raft of analytics and trading statistics to an already strong hand in indices and equity prices.\u00a0The transaction is already the subject of automatic antitrust scrutiny. </p><p>One can see why the exchanges like the data business. Revenues are high and rising, especially from the FTSE Russell indices business. This should benefit from the unstoppable growth of passive investment. In contrast, commissions from securities trading are dropping. Combining data groups can bring cost benefits, too. The LSE thinks it can save more than \u00a3100m annually on technology alone by combining with Refinitiv.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Brussels, for its part, worries that its regulations, such as the Mifid II assault on equity research, have not brought down data prices as much as expected. Watchdogs, donning the periwig of Adam Smith, expect these to reflect the cost of production plus a \u201creasonable\u201d margin. LSE\u2019s ebitda margins are anything but reasonable: 56 per cent in the past 12 months, only a tad down on 2016\u2019s figure of 59 per cent. </p><p>Financial data pours forth from the markets every second. The spigots are controlled by fewer and fewer companies. If the FCA has questioned the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2999e6b2-bcd8-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\"> high margins </url>of asset managers \u2014 forcing them to declare their research costs \u2014 then it is right to take a tough stance on data providers with sometimes twice the profitability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

The perimeter is decided by the Government and Parliament through legislation.     In June 2019, the FCA published its first annual perimeter report , which sought to provide greater clarity to stakeholders on the FCA\u2019s role and set out specific issues that had arisen, most notably those facing consumers in the retail investment sector.     This year\u2019s report gives updates on the issues discussed in last year\u2019s report. This includes the issuing of a temporary product intervention in January to ban the mass-marketing of speculative illiquid debt securities and preference shares to retail investors for 12 months. The FCA is currently consulting on proposals to make this ban permanent.     The report also identifies where others, such as big tech firms like Google, can do more to protect consumers in areas on the edge of the perimeter.    The report also sets out other areas where progress has been made or where there is continued harm to consumers and market users around the perimeter, particularly in light of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.     Christopher Woolard, interim Chief Executive at the FCA, said: \u201cOur annual perimeter report is key to providing clarity on our approach, contributing to the public debate around perimeter issues, highlighting where others have a part to play and promoting transparency around our work with the Government.     \u201cThese are challenging times for firms, consumers and the wider economy. The coronavirus crisis may exacerbate existing perimeter issues and encourage unlawful activity. We are focused on providing assistance to those consumers who need it. We continue to take action to protect consumers from losing money they can\u2019t afford on high risk investments and falling victim to scams.\u201d    This report will form the basis of a formal discussion with the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (EST) later this year, the outputs of which will be published, to help improve transparency around the actions being taken on the perimeter.   Notes to editors  Perimeter Report 2019/20 .  The FCA is also seeking views on how to improve the consumer investment market. Feedback from stakeholders will shape the FCA\u2019s work in the coming years to deliver a market that works well for the millions of people who rely on it.

This includes the issuing of a temporary product intervention in January to ban the mass-marketing of speculative illiquid debt securities and preference shares to retail investors for 12 months. The FCA is currently consulting on proposals to make this ban permanent.    The report also identifies where others, such as big tech firms like Google, can do more to protect consumers in areas on the edge of the perimeter.    The report also sets out other areas where progress has been made or where there is continued harm to consumers and market users around the perimeter, particularly in light of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.    Christopher Woolard, interim Chief Executive at the FCA, said \u201cOur annual perimeter report is key to providing clarity on our approach, contributing to the public debate around perimeter issues, highlighting where others have a part to play and promoting transparency around our work with the Government.\u201d    \u201cThese are challenging times for firms, consumers and the wider economy. The coronavirus crisis may exacerbate existing perimeter issues and encourage unlawful activity. We are focused on providing assistance to those consumers who need it. We continue to take action to protect consumers from losing money they can\u2019t afford on high risk investments and falling victim to scams.\u201d    This report will form the basis of a formal discussion with the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (EST) later this year, the outputs of which will be published, to help improve transparency around the actions being taken on the perimeter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43192036171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y9-PBC1-F07F-830S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Credit-Connect.co.uk</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Wheeler and the two other Democratic members of the commission supported the proposal, which will now be open for public comments before a final vote on the rule.

Frank    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to protect Americans by regulating the telecom industry. Instead, they have been doing the exact opposite since long before the Trump administration.    Current FCC Chair, Ajit Pai , has referred to this as \u201cnot being heavy handed.\u201d Lawsuits have been filed against the FCC for NOT protecting Americans from unsafe levels of radiation (see 1 , 2 ) as well as 5G deployment (see 1 , 2 , 3 ). Activist Post archives are jam packed with articles about the FCC being on everybody\u2019s s**t list except for Big Telecom\u2019s and their cronies. It\u2019s no surprise that the agency has authorized millions MORE taxpayer dollars for rural broadband. Of course there is no guarantee that any of this will be done safely.       From Benton:    The Federal Communications Commission authorized over $20 million in funding over ten years to expand rural broadband in Minnesota and Pennsylvania. Viasat will serve rural locations in Pennsylvania with $19,945,120 in FCC support, and Tribal provider Fond du Lac Communications, Inc. will receive $55,011 to provide gigabit fixed broadband to serve small, isolated communities in Tribal areas in Minnesota. The funding represents the 14th wave of support from the successful 2018 Connect America Fund Phase II auction. Providers must build out to 40% of the assigned homes and businesses in the areas won in a state within three years. Buildout must increase by 20% in each subsequent year, until complete buildout is reached at the end of the sixth year.    The FCC is part of \u201cThe Swamp\u201d that Trump promised to drain.

President Donald Trump withdrew Mike O'Rielly's renomination to another term on the FCC after the commissioner expressed such concerns (see 2008210055). Other speakers slammed the Trump move to exercise more control over the internet, calling it an abuse of power. Commissioner Brendan Carr said he's ready to move ahead on rules.</p><p>The commission argued that its authority to police the network was limited under Section 230 in the 2017 restoring internet freedom order, but the net neutrality ruling focused on 230 (b) and didn't address 230 (c), under which the administration sought action here, Candeub responded to our question. \"We're talking about different parts of Section 230,\" he said. \"Section 230 (b) is a bunch of policy statements, some of which can be argued one way or another, but they lack ... actual legal power,\" he said: \"That's not the same as Section 230 (c).\"</p><p>As the internet took off, \"there was a serpent in the garden,\" Candeub said. \"There were challenges in keeping the forum free, as well as friendly to families and children,\" which led to passage of the CDA in 1996, he said. Candeub said the FCC has all the authority it needs under case law to approve rules.</p><p>Candeub didn't really answer the question on the net neutrality repeal, said Gigi Sohn of the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law &amp; Policy. The FCC said \"it did not have authority to adopt conduct rules for ISPs and transparency rules to the edge,\" she said. The agency \"has its own precedent that it has to overcome,\" she said. Sohn noted \"the irony or hypocrisy of using the language in 230 ... to abdicate its oversight over ISPs.\" The FCC can change its mind, \"but it has an awful lot of precedent and strong language, including some strong language in dissents,\" she said, \"that it would have to overcome.\"</p><p>Carr said he has often been asked how he can square his views on platform rules with those on net neutrality. Carr also noted the prior order dealt with 230 (b). \"That's more hortatory, it's policy, it's not a grant of rulemaking authority,\" he said: \"Here, we're talking about an entirely different provision.\"</p><p>The question before the FCC is \"can you interpret the words in 230 (c) and give those words meaning, which is a very different legal exercise than can you use 230 (b) as a hook to impose substantive rules that are outside of 230 entirely,\" Carr said. The fight three years ago wasn't about throttling or blocking but about whether utility rules should apply to ISPs, he said: \"The conduct that we see by internet providers is drastically different than the conduct that we see by big tech. The reason for some kind of rules that would rein in big tech has much more purchase with me.\"</p><p>\"There's no role for the FCC\" in Section 230, Sohn said. To say the FCC can impose transparency rules for platforms \"doesn't make sense within the context of the entire structure and purpose\" of the act, she said: \"That's something that courts will look at as well in determining if an agency ... deserves Chevron deference.\"</p><p>Carr said the FCC has the authority to act and shouldn't wait for direction from Congress. \"The case law in this is actually very clear,\" he said. \"Of all the arguments that are out there,\" the legal standing argument is one of the weakest, he said.</p><p>\"In no small part due to Section 230, the U.S. has really become a global leader in innovation,\" said Jamie Susskind, CTA vice president-policy and regulatory affairs. Imposing restrictions on social media platforms \"makes us more like China and other authoritarian governments that are not as friendly towards free speech and innovation as the U.S. has been,\" she said. Susskind was a Carr aide.</p><p>Section 230 revisions shouldn't happen \"in the aftermath of a presidential executive order because [Trump] was mad at one social media company, with the FCC becoming the arbiter of free speech in America,\" said Avery Gardiner, Center for Democracy &amp; Technology general counsel: \"It's just a terrible idea.\" Gardiner noted Trump acted two days after Twitter marked two of his tweets as possibly containing misinformation. \"Both the petition and executive order say that they're for free speech, but that is a pretty thin veneer,\" she said. The group sued to block the executive order. The White House didn't comment.</p><p>O'Rielly lost his job over the issue, Sohn said. \"I actually think if Trump had not stabbed him in the back, he would have voted for an NPRM because he's such a good soldier.\" If Trump is reelected, \"hell, yeah\" the FCC will move forward but doing so before the election would be difficult, she said: \"They'd have to be rushing like crazy.\" Chairman Ajit Pai controls the agenda and has been \"extraordinarily muted,\" she said.</p><p>\"I'm ready to move forward,\" Carr said, noting the comment cycle just closed. \"The calendar is a little bit tight.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YG-8BF1-JC8G-8002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Amazon detailed plans for the project last year, when it filed its plans for the FCC\u2019s approval. In a tweet, Pai said he shared with his colleagues a proposal to approve, with conditions, the Kuiper application to deploy and operate a non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGS)) fixed satellite service (FSS).    The chairman didn\u2019t elaborate on what the conditions would be. Bloomberg noted that his request is likely to result in approval in closed-door voting at the agency, where Pai leads the Republican majority.    The Kuiper System is designed to use 3,236 satellites operating in 98 orbital planes, at altitudes between 366 and 391 miles.

He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast for bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday.</p><p>Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to \"approach\" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon- which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p>He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality.</p><p>EARLY TECH RESISTANCE</p><p>The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would \"result in a worse internet for consumers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix - has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around.</p><p>\"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>\"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast for bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday.</p><p>Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to \"approach\" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon- which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p>He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality.</p><p>EARLY TECH RESISTANCE</p><p>The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would \"result in a worse internet for consumers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix - has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around.</p><p>\"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>\"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast for bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday.</p><p>Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to \"approach\" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon- which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p>He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality.</p><p>EARLY TECH RESISTANCE</p><p>The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would \"result in a worse internet for consumers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix - has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around.</p><p>\"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>\"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
