But workers say the work can be crippling in more ways than one.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amanda Caballero wishes she could go back to work at Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She made $15 an hour at the Fresno fulfillment center - several dollars more than the state's minimum wage - and received more than three months of paid maternity leave. Her generous health insurance package covered her husband and five children, and she liked her managers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a wrist injury left the 31-year-old Fresno woman unable to work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Standing on a two-step ladder during her Amazon shift last March, she was struggling to get a heavy box out of a cubby. She re-gripped the box and tugged, but her glove was stuck under the box. As she pulled, her hand stayed in place, straining her wrist, her medical records show.</p><p>She recently stopped receiving worker's compensation payments and doesn't qualify for any available jobs, Amazon or otherwise, from nurse's assistant to retail cashier, because she can't lift even a gallon of milk. The family now depends on her husband's income as a security guard, help from their family and food stamps. Despite weeks of physical therapy, it's unclear when her wrist will heal.</p><p>Caballero's injury was one of 307 injuries and illnesses recorded at the Fresno fulfillment center between June 2018, when it opened, and May 2019, according to federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration records.</p><p>In 2018, the Fresno warehouse's rate of serious injuries - those that require job restrictions or days off work - was nearly 12 injuries per 100 workers. That was nearly three times the national warehouse industry average last year, and more than double the statewide industry average, according to OSHA records obtained by the Reveal Reporting Networks.</p><p>The injury rate in Fresno<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/find-out-what-injuries-are-like-at-the-amazon-warehouse-that-handled-your-packages/\"> ranked tenth among 28 Amazon warehouses</url> nationwide for which Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting obtained 2018 records. It ranked third among CaliforniaAmazon warehouses.</p><p>The center, among the top corporate employers in the county, employs more than 2,500 people.</p><p>The Bee spoke with more than a dozen Amazon workers, four of whom were injured and agreed to go on the record. They said the job was great, as were the pay and benefits. But they said injuries at Amazon were crippling in more ways than one.</p><p>The workers described a stressful work environment, where they had to keep a breakneck pace or face write-ups from supervisors. They feared taking bathroom breaks or time off over injuries or illness because they said they felt doing so would put their jobs at risk. They also said they feared or were discouraged from filing injury reports, which indicates that official rates may be undercounted.</p><p>The vast majority of injuries were described on OSHA reports as sprains and strains to the back, wrist, shoulder and ankles. The remaining workers sustained bruises, fractures or smash injuries, like crushed toes, or skin irritations. The workers interviewed by the Bee reported mostly sprains and strains due to repetitive motions.</p><p>While they were made to stretch before work and lunch, and microstretch throughout the day, employees said repeating the same motion over and over wore on their muscles and ligaments.</p><p>Some who were hurt on the job said they struggled to get and keep workers' compensation, and still feel the physical effects of their injuries months after their benefits ended.</p><p>Amazon responds</p><p>In an emailed statement to The Bee, an Amazon spokesperson said their injury rates appear high because the company is aggressive about recording injuries, regardless of whether they are work-related. Amazon said they believe others in the industry dramatically under-report.</p><p>\"You're seeing this in the rates because we take an abundance of caution in not placing employees with work restrictions back at work before they are ready. We know that by making a conservative choice to not place an injured associate back into a job before permitted by their work restrictions, we are increasing lost time as a company, but with the intent to benefit the associate.\"</p><p>The company added that training and protocols to ensure safety are ubiquitous at Amazon. The company has spent over $55 million on capital investments specific to safety improvements, they wrote. For example, supervisors are supposed to track and audit progress on reducing physical risk, and every associate is asked to fill out a monthly safety survey.</p><p>Caballero doesn't blame Amazon.</p><p>The job was the best she's had, and a rigorous set of safety guidelines existed, including mandated daily stretching. But she believes supervisors were under such high pressure to meet quotas they encouraged workers to do anything for the job, regardless of the physical toll.</p><p>\"They knew what was happening and they just let it happen,\" Caballero said.</p><p>Amazon said they have never heard of supervisors encouraging teams to bypass safety guidelines to meet quotas.</p><p>\"Like most companies, we have performance expectations for every Amazonian - be it corporate employee or fulfillment center associate and we measure actual performance against those expectations,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Associate performance is measured and evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour.\"</p><p>A big win for Fresno</p><p>At 855,000 square feet, Amazon's fulfillment center in Fresno spans about 14 football fields. It runs 24 hours a day and utilizes hundreds of robots.</p><p>A machine illuminates for workers like Caballero what items to grab from cubbies or bins, and where to place them. Robots resembling automatic vacuum cleaners underneath shelves whisk items across the floor. More than 10 miles of conveyors virtually fly packages from one end of the warehouse to another. Computers scan open-faced cubbies and packages winding their way through the warehouse decipher whether a package is on the right track.</p><p>The city spent nearly a year in negotiations with Amazon to secure the state-of-the-art warehouse. Mayor Lee Brand's Economic Expansion Act, approved by the City Council in 2016, calls for Fresno to rebate 90% of the city's share of property taxes as well as the city's entire share of sales and use taxes paid by the company on purchases it makes in Fresno.</p><p>The city spent more than $1 million in broadband installation, expanded roads leading to the warehouse and modified bus routes, according to Fresno City council member Luis Chavez, a vocal supporter of Fresno's Amazon deal.</p><p>To qualify for the incentives, hard-capped at $30 million over 30 years, Amazon agreed to provide 750 new full-time jobs at the center throughout that time period.</p><p>Amazon committed to a $53 million investment in the city, county and Fresno Unified School District over 30 years. Since opening, they have donated $15,000 to Fresno Unified School District to support STEM and robotics education for more than 600 local students and $25,000 to the nonprofit WestCare Homeless Alleviation, they said.</p><p>In addition to a $15 minimum wage, Amazon offers employees comprehensive medical, vision and dental benefits, as well as a 401k plan with a 50% company match. Employees on maternity or family leave receive up to 20 weeks of paid leave. Amazon also offers nearly full tuition for employees to go back to school in high-demand fields, they said.</p><p>Chavez said Amazon's presence has forced other warehouses, like Kraft and OK produce, to raise hourly wages by $2 or $3 in order to compete. It also put Fresno on the map for other companies, he said.</p><p>\"Now that Amazon and Ulta came, there's been a lot of interest in other companies coming to Fresno, and I think that's been a big plus for the city of Fresno to provide more jobs for the community,\" Chavez said.</p><p>However, he added the city needs to dig deeper to learn why the injury rate is \"abnormally high.\"</p><p>\"To have 12 out of 100 employees to be injured in that span is really high,\" Chavez said. \"Our goal should not be the state or the national average, it should be well below that.\"</p><p>In an emailed statement to The Bee, Brand said he couldn't speak about the company's workplace injuries, but said worker safety in general was a basic expectation.</p><p>\"Since their e-commerce center opened in 2018, Amazon has had a positive effect on our community as well as our economy, providing thousands of good paying jobs that helped Fresno achieve record low unemployment and bring opportunity and advancement for Fresno families,\" Brand said.</p><p>He added regulatory agencies like Cal/OSHA closely monitor and enforce worker safety.</p><p>\"I expect every business in Fresno to not only comply with worker safety laws, but also to value their employees. Given what Amazon has done for their employees with benefits and education incentives, I expect that they also take workplace safety very seriously.\"</p><p>Fear over reporting injuries</p><p>In most cases, workers said they were scared to report injuries to their supervisors. When they did, they said they felt discouraged from filing formal injury reports.</p><p>Caballero feared reporting her injury because she had heard from her coworkers it could result in being passed up for a promotion. She told her manager anyway, when she could no longer work with her right hand.</p><p>\"I didn't really want to have a report written for my injury and get treated differently,\" she said.</p><p>Tambra Recek, 33, said she injured her back lifting boxes at the warehouse and the pain drove her to tears. At Amcare, the in-house first aid facility, she said she was told she would have to clock out to see a doctor. She still has not seen a doctor to diagnose her injury because she has no health care.</p><p>\"I can't afford to not get paid. I have kids,\" Recek said. \"Finally I said, you know what, I'm fine. I'm fine. They asked, 'Do you want to drop the case?' So I signed those papers saying that you don't want to go further. But you still have to pack. You still have to go fast and it's hard when you're in a lot of pain.\"</p><p>Kelly Hoffman, a 40-year-old mother of four, said she was injured three times before she reported it because she was scared of losing her livelihood.</p><p>First, she said a box fell on her shoulder. Then, she pulled a muscle reaching for a box in a cubby. In January, her wrists began aching, but she said she only let her supervisors know months later.</p><p>Her husband, Keith, said he was picking up a flat of energy drinks from a bin to scan and put into a tray when he felt his back pop in July. When a manager took him to Amcare during a break, he urged her to come along because she kept rubbing her wrist.</p><p>In their emailed response, Amazon officials said the health and safety of associates is their top priority and they \"support employees when they have personal obligations, health matters or other life events that require support.\" The company declined to discuss individual complaints to respect the privacy of employees, but said they have zero tolerance for retaliation for employees who raise concerns.</p><p>Seeking care</p><p>Hoffman had her wrist wrapped and returned to work. She went to the doctor the next day because she learned the tightly wrapped bandage was constricting her nerves, worsening the injury. She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists.</p><p>\"Patient may have a baseline narrowed canal, which was aggravated by the repeated work she does at Amazon,\" her medical records say.</p><p>Keith, 43, was sent to the doctor, who later found a mild disc bulge and a narrowing between two of his vertebrae, his records show.</p><p>Both were taken out of work and put on worker's compensation, receiving around $800 every two weeks.</p><p>They said there was no Ibuprofen at the clinic nor in the vending machine in the break room.</p><p>\"It's always gone because everyone goes to work sick there because you never have time,\" Keith said. \"I can't tell you how many times I saw somebody throwing up in a garbage can there because they don't want to get fired for missing work.\"</p><p>While Amazon declined to comment on specific incidents, they said onsite medical representatives \"follow clear, established company guidelines for first aid treatment in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.\"</p><p>They added no associate should ever be discouraged from seeking care. Employees receive up to five weeks of time off a year and full health benefits starting on day one.</p><p>A stressful work environment</p><p>Recek, the mother of two who threw out her back in March, remembers being under constant stress. The loud, steady hum from machinery and loud fans buzzed in her ear during the 10-hour shifts, with no respite. (Phones are not allowed on the floor.) She said she always felt watched by supervisors who stood on elevated platforms overlooking work stations.</p><p>If she went to the bathroom, which was about half a block and two flights of stairs from her station, she would be asked why she had taken so long off-task.</p><p>Amazon countered that every employee has quick, easy access to bathrooms and is allowed to use them freely.</p><p>In April 2019, Recek broke down while packing boxes.</p><p>\"I don't know what triggered it. I was standing there. Somebody was talking to me and I blacked out. I was bent over the counter and I just was stuck. They said they were talking to me and I wasn't replying. My manager came over and said what happened? I said huh? I didn't remember.\"</p><p>After what she called an anxiety attack, Recek left work on a leave of absence. She didn't qualify for worker's compensation, so she received disability payments from the state until her fund ran out in December. But she said she has been unable to afford medication to treat her anxiety and depression because her benefits ended in October. She has been working in food delivery through apps like PostMates to keep up with bills, but she said her back is in constant pain from the injury she never formally reported. She has no medical documents to support the reason for her leave of absence.</p><p>Hoffman and her husband also lost their health insurance, with no prior notice, when their short-term disability ended in December. They both suffer from high blood pressure, and have three kids on their health insurance, so they worry about what they will do when they run out of medicine or their kids need to see their eye doctor.</p><p>\"We busted our butts for these people and that's the pay we get, is losing our benefits - while we're injured -because of them,\" Keith said.</p><p>'I would do it again'</p><p>In spite of high injury rates, most of the workers interviewed said they enjoyed their jobs, and would go back if they could.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/22/un-report-mbs-linked-account-hacked-jeff-bezos-phone/\">UN report: MbS-linked account hacked Jeff Bezos' phone       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/21/did-jeff-bezos-buy-his-neighbors-mansion/\">           Did Jeff Bezos Buy His Neighbor's Mansion?       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">           Bloomberg says Warren, Sanders don't 'know what they're talking about' on breaking up big tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/08/huge-industrial-complex-is-launched-in-milpitas-could-lure-amazon-or-other-tech-firms/\">           Huge industrial complex is launched in Milpitas, could lure top tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/08/midwest-investors-scoop-up-huge-santa-clara-site-that-is-leased-to-amazon-unit/\">           Wheeling and dealing on Amazon-leased building in Santa Clara       </url>   \"The opportunities are endless when it comes to working with Amazon,\" said Ivan Agcaoili, a process assistant at Amazon who did not suffer any injuries. \"As long as you keep your head down, you work hard, you learn the process to understand everything, you're good to go.

He believes the company he helped create in a Harvard dorm room has become too big and must be regulated.</p><p><br/> For every dollar spent on social media advertising, 84 cents goes to Facebook. Their average monthly user numbers are staggering as well. They have designed their different platforms to interconnect in a effort to keep users clicking and coming back.<br/>Hughes describes the reason Facebook has gotten so big is its aggressive stance towards competitors. In many cases, Facebook has either bought its competitors or just copied them, putting them out of business. This makes it almost impossible to compete with Facebook in any market they are active in. There has been very little funding for new social media companies since Facebook has taken over. No major new platforms have emerged since 2011.<br/> Platform usage graphic by the NY Times<br/> Following scandal after scandal, many users have expressed frustration that there is nowhere else to go besides Facebook. They don't have a single legitimate competitor. Some users have ditched Facebook for Instagram, unaware that Facebook owns that as well. The argument goes that controlling our news through the Facebook news feed, our messaging through WhatsApp, and our media through Instagram, Hughes believes Facebook has gotten too powerful. Zuckerberg doesn't have a boss, can't be fired, and controls 60% of the voting shares of the company's board of directors.<br/> One of Hughes's biggest complaints is how Facebook manages content. Their algorithms can make or break companies depending on where it positions them in users' feeds. There is little to no oversight on what Facebook can and can't do regarding how it handles privacy, hate speech, and fake news.<br/> To start bringing Facebook back under control, Hughes outlines two main steps that should be taken. First, he believes the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp should be overturned. He wants these to be separate companies that Zuckerberg and Facebook do not control.<br/> Second, he is advocating for the creation of a government body to regulate the social media industry. Just like pharmaceuticals are regulated by the FDA and airlines are regulated by the FAA, he believes there should be an organization to regulate social media. This government body would set rules for what is classified under free speech versus hate speech. They would also be tasked with ensuring social media companies properly protect the privacy of the users' data they are entrusted with.<br/> He views recent proposals by politicians in regulating and breakup up big tech companies as hopeful. Facebook's influence as a whole is here to stay, but only time will tell how much of it remains under their control.<br/> Second View: To bring some counterpoint to Chris Hughes' views, his call for supervision no doubt involves more bureaucracy and a lack of trust in the public's right to choose which platforms to use. Maybe Facebook's dominance of today will be trumped a decade later by a newer, better idea. It also reminds us of the few times a successful tech company with a dominant position in the market has turned so big that as a consequence, it also becomes an easy target of criticism for every mistake they make. Think Microsoft's Windows a decade ago and Google's search monopoly, which is still ongoing.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10998421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3V-7TK1-JBYT-H19Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He believes the company and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have too much control over our news, the social media market, and society in general. He is advocating that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp be overturned as well as a new government body being formed to regulate social media companies.In the New York Times op-ed[1], Hughes lays out a compelling argument for breaking up Facebook. </p><p>He believes the company he helped create in a Harvard dorm room has become too big and must be regulated. For every dollar spent on social media advertising, 84 cents goes to Facebook. Their average monthly user numbers are staggering as well. They have designed their different platforms to interconnect in a effort to keep users clicking and coming back. Hughes describes the reason Facebook has gotten so big is its aggressive stance towards competitors. In many cases, Facebook has either bought its competitors or just copied them, putting them out of business. This makes it almost impossible to compete with Facebook in any market they are active in. There has been very little funding for new social media companies since Facebook has taken over. No major new platforms have emerged since 2011.Platform usage graphic by the NY Times Following scandal after scandal, many users have expressed frustration that there is nowhere else to go besides Facebook. They don't have a single legitimate competitor. Some users have ditched Facebook for Instagram, unaware that Facebook owns that as well. The argument goes that controlling our news through the Facebook news feed, our messaging through WhatsApp, and our media through Instagram, Hughes believes Facebook has gotten too powerful. Zuckerberg doesn't have a boss, can't be fired, and controls 60% of the voting shares of the company's board of directors. One of Hughes's biggest complaints is how Facebook manages content. Their algorithms can make or break companies depending on where it positions them in users' feeds. There is little to no oversight on what Facebook can and can't do regarding how it handles privacy, hate speech, and fake news. To start bringing Facebook back under control, Hughes outlines two main steps that should be taken. First, he believes the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp should be overturned. He wants these to be separate companies that Zuckerberg and Facebook do not control. Second, he is advocating for the creation of a government body to regulate the social media industry. Just like pharmaceuticals are regulated by the FDA and airlines are regulated by the FAA, he believes there should be an organization to regulate social media. This government body would set rules for what is classified under free speech versus hate speech. They would also be tasked with ensuring social media companies properly protect the privacy of the users' data they are entrusted with. He views recent proposals by politicians in regulating and breakup up big tech companies as hopeful. Facebook's influence as a whole is here to stay, but only time will tell how much of it remains under their control. Second View: To bring some counterpoint to Chris Hughes' views, his call for supervision no doubt involves more bureaucracy and a lack of trust in the public's right to choose which platforms to use. Maybe Facebook's dominance of today will be trumped a decade later by a newer, better idea. It also reminds us of the few times a successful tech company with a dominant position in the market has turned so big that as a consequence, it also becomes an easy target of criticism for every mistake they make. Think Microsoft's Windows a decade ago and Google's search monopoly, which is still ongoing.Related ReadsShare this article: [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881155742244488225176500096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-F9T1-JCMN-Y421-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><timeReceived>5:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The case centers on a principle of Spanish law known as \"the right to be forgotten,\" and it's Google's latest clash with European privacy laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's say someone accuses you of a crime. The local newspaper picks up the accusation, but then you defend yourself, and are proven innocent. Years later, that newspaper report may still exist somewhere on the Internet. Do you have a right to have it omitted?</p><p>That's the question a Madrid court is debating, in a case between the tech giant Googleand Spain's data protection agency. Spanish authorities filed 90 court orders against Google, on behalf of Spanish citizens who want links to libelous information about them dropped from Googlesearches. Here in Spain, their desire is enshrined in law, and called \"the right to be forgotten.\"</p><p>\"The general argument is what we call 'derecho al olvido,' the kind of right to be forgotten, and it's based on the right of every single individual and citizen has to claim for his or her data to be used in a proper manner,\" said Paloma Llaneza, a data protection lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs. \"Just to explain it in a very simple way, when you are Googling someone and you are finding some information, what we ask is to delete, or to make not available that information through Google.\"</p><p>Googledid not respond to requests for an interview. But the company has issued previous statements saying it's not its job to censor the Internet. Google says it's your local newspaper's responsibility to eliminate any false reports - not Google's. The tech company refused the Spanish orders, and it's all being argued now in court.</p><p>Llaneza says it's an issue of respecting Spanish law, if Googlewants to do business here.</p><p>\"Maybe for Googlesometimes it's difficult to understand,\" Llaneza added. \"There are different cultures all around the world. But the truth is, we very much care about privacy and about data protection. And especially because Googleis addressing its services to the Spanish country. They are using a dot-E-S domain name, they are translating everything into Spanish and they are tailoring their services for our country. So they have to be prepared to comply with Spanish law - that's all.\"</p><p>This is Google's latest clash with Europe's relatively strict privacy laws. The company is either in court or on the brink in Britain, Germany, France, Italy and the Czech Republic as well, over how it collects personal information about users. Many of the complaints are about Google's \"Street View\" project - capturing images of nearly every street and house - that some governments feel violates property owners' privacy.</p><p>Joel Reidenberg has been professor of information law in Paris and New York. He says most European privacy laws were written well before the Internet, and there's an inherent clash between privacy and the very nature of the web - free-flowing information that doesn't stop at national borders.</p><p>\"These problems will absolutely continue to come up, until one of two things happens: Either the technology companies begin to build architectures that enable compliance with existing law, or the law begins to change,\" Reidenberg said.</p><p>Reidenberg says he thinks the sheer number of legal complaints about Googleshows that European governments aren't likely to back down.</p><p>\"I think these are illustrations that the regulatory agencies are saying to the technology companies building business models around the use of personal information, that they must be adapting their technologies to make them privacy friendly,\" Reidenberg added.</p><p>That's exactly what happened in Germany. Hans Kessler, a privacy law expert in Leipzig, says that after complaints about \"Street View\" there, Googleset up a service through which residents could request that their houses be blurred out on the Internet.</p><p>\"So far there's no court decision, but there was an agreement between Googleand data protection authorities in Germany,\" said Kessler. \"Googleactually introduced a formal complaint procedure. Owners of houses or even just people living there, inhabitants, could file a complaint with Google, so they could enforce their right and the house would be pixilated, so it's no longer visible on Google.\" Kessler says Googlewas able to avoid litigation on the Street View issue, but he thinks German regulators are gearing up for more battles.</p><p>\"It's really the only way for the companies to avoid stricter regulations, though I really think there will be strict regulations,\" Kessler added. \"I'm not totally in favor of them, but there are so many feuds now on the Internet where we see efforts of the states to enforce stricter controls on the Internet.\"</p><p>Llaneza, the Spanish lawyer, says she thinks some of these privacy battles are inevitable for big tech companies like Google.</p><p>\"There are advantages to being a worldwide company, but there are some disadvantages. You have to take into consideration domestic law,\" said Llaneza.</p><p>A ruling on Google's case in Spain is expected within weeks or months.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-VA211Y9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOVPUB2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5231-WJ41-JCCP-018N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468347</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Voice of America News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>February 1, 2011</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Dad was a travelling furniture salesman in the 1980s, a job that served him well in the years before globalisation hobbled the Canadian manufacturing sector. He was out on the road a lot, but when he worked from home he sat in his office, a small windowless study dominated by a large teak desk. There wasn't much on it - synthetic upholstery swatches, a mug of pens, a lamp, a phone, an ashtray. And yet every day Dad spent hours there, making notes, smoking Craven \"A\"s, drinking coffee and yakking affably to small-town retailers about shipments of sectional sofas and dinette sets. This is what I find so amazing. That my father - like most other professionals of his generation and generations before him - was able to earn a salary and support our family with little more than a phone and a stack of papers. Just thinking of his desk, the emptiness of it, induces in me a strange disorientation and loneliness. How did he sit there all day, I wonder, without the internet to keep him company?</p><p>In this age of uncertainty, predictions have lost value, but here's an irrefutable one: quite soon, no person on earth will remember what the world was like before the internet. There will be records, of course (stored in the intangibly limitless archive of the cloud), but the actual lived experience of what it was like to think and feel and be human before the emergence of big data will be gone. When that happens, what will be lost?</p><p>                       Earlier this year I travelled to Wilmslow, a suburb of greater Manchester, to interview <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">Elizabeth Denham</url>, the UK's Information Commissioner and arguably the most empowered data regulator on the planet. Our discussion was wide-ranging, but among the ICO's projects she was most enthusiastic about was the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">Age Appropriate Design</url> Code, or Kids' Code for short, currently in public consultation. An extrapolation of last year's Data Protection Act, the new code was devised over several months by a tech child welfare dream team composed of the filmmaker Baroness       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">Beeban Kidron</url>, children's commissioner       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">Anne Longfield</url> and then minister for digital and creative industries Margot James.</p><p>The code, which is expected to be laid before parliament this autumn, would completely revolutionise the digital landscape for British children. Among its standards are strict content and design limitations on apps, games and platforms that target minors.</p><p>We are the last of a dying breed who knew days of nothing</p><p>Widely used technologies that nudge or manipulate children through algorithms or intermittent reward systems designed to get and keep their attention would be scrutinised and banned. Instead, the onus would be on tech companies to prove \"the best interests of a child as the primary consideration\" in any product or platform targeted at the youth market.</p><p>When I mentioned to Denham that I grew up entirely without the internet - having sent my first email on the first day of first year university in 1994 - her eyes brightened. \"Ah ha!\" she said. \"So you're one of the Last of the Innocents.\"</p><p>What she meant by this is that my population cohort - roughly speaking those born in the mid-to-late 1970s - are the last generation of humans on the planet to have grown up prior to the popularisation of digital culture. Another name for us, coined by the Vancouver writer Michael Harris in his book The End of Absence, is \"digital immigrants,\" which he defines as those who have lived both \"with and without the crowded connectivity of online life.\"</p><p>Denham's Kids' Code is an audacious act - a radical new set of rules that would reimagine the internet as a garden of creativity and knowledge for children, rather than the chaotic circus of unregulated content and dubious corporate interests that characterise its current state. The optimism and daring ambition of her project suggests a question I didn't think to ask until I was already on the train back from Wilmslow: is it possible to regain innocence lost?</p><p>                       For weeks after meeting Denham, I found myself haunted by the notion of digital immigration and what it means for my generation. I'd always assumed that not being connected as a child had been a handicap - surely it explained why I'm hopeless at figuring out the smart TV remote or programming the digital thermostat. Like most kids I spent idle summer days drifting around our garden spying faces in the clouds, but my childhood (like most kids in the 80s) was also awash in cultural drek. I had way more weekly screen time than my own kids, most of it spent zoning out on bad sitcom reruns and mind-numbing hours playing Pac-Man on our Commodore 64 so our mum - a housewife with no domestic help - could get the next meal on the table. Surely bingeing on the brilliance of Pixar films and the architectural complexities of Minecraft today is a superior way for a child to spend a rainy afternoon?</p><p>I began to investigate what it was that marked my generation out - what was the \"innocence\" lost, if any? I was surprised then to discover many of the neuroscientists, cyber-psychologists and tech ethicists who spend their lives pondering the cultural and moral ramifications of the digital revolution have come to believe that there is something special in my generation, and the recollection of our shared analogue past.</p><p>It's not that digital immigrants are smarter or more talented than the digital natives that came after us. Our uniqueness, it seems, lies in the fact that we are the last of a dying breed and as such, living, breathing receptacles of a soon-to-be lost plane of human experience: empty yawning hours and days of nothing much at all.</p><p>                       \"Which would you rather be, extremely poor with loads of friends or super rich with no friends at all?\" This hypothetical question was put to me recently out of nowhere by my 11-year-old stepson. For me the answer was easy. \"Poor with friends,\" I said. \"In the long run, loneliness would be worse than poverty.\"</p><p>My stepson disagreed. \"Defo rich with no friends. I'd just stay in my mansion and play Fortnite and watch YouTube and hang out with people online.\"</p><p>He's a popular kid and part of a close-knit group of boys who've been friends since starting school. When offered a choice of whether they'd like to watch a movie together or spend two hours playing Fortnite and interfacing remotely on headsets, the lads didn't miss a beat in choosing the latter. This is because, for digital natives like my stepson and his mates, socialising online is the same as - at times even preferable to - socialising in person.</p><p>For his 11th birthday he got his first smart phone and it was as if we'd handed him the keys to a magic portal to an idealised parallel universe. I suppose in a way we had. Just as puberty begins to set in, we'd given him a comfort innocents like me and my husband had never known as alienated adolescents: the feeling of being with friends all the time. The absence of aloneness.</p><p>                       For years, scientific debate has raged over whether or not sustained internet use has a deleterious effect on human brain function - particularly on the developing brains of children. The never-ending \"screentime debate\" has, historically, been heavy on conjecture and light on hard data. But this spring the results of a sweeping international <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\">study</url> were published in World Psychiatry, a respected international journal, which may have tipped the balance in favour of digital sceptics. An international team of researchers working with large sample groups in two separate methodologies (MRI brain imaging and behavioural observation), consistently found compelling evidence that prolonged internet use produces both \"acute and sustained alterations in specific areas of cognition,\" which may reflect long-term changes in the brain, affecting attention span, memory and social interactions.</p><p>It was in those lost hours that we really got to know ourselves</p><p>Dr Joseph Firth, the Manchester-born neuroscientist who led the study told me that while the human brain does seem to interpret online socialising and connection in much the same way as the in-person variety (great news for friendless super-rich shut-ins), other cognitive functions are shown to be weakened. For instance, he said, the brain adapts fairly quickly to treating the internet as a kind of outsourced memory bank, which results over time in the reduction of our own \"transactive memory function,\" ie the mental sorting processes the brain performs in order to locate and grasp a fact or mental image.</p><p>\"The problem with the internet,\" Firth explained, \"is that our brains seem to quickly figure out it's there - and outsource.\" This would be fine if we could rely on the internet for information the same way we rely on, say, the British Library. But what happens when we subconsciously outsource a complex cognitive function to an unreliable online world manipulated by capitalist interests and agents of distortion? \"What happens to children born in a world where transactive memory is no longer as widely exercised as a cognitive function?\" he asked.</p><p>                       James Williams, a former Google strategist-turned Oxford-trained philosopher and digital ethicist is convinced the loss of solitude we are now experiencing is more than just an end of innocence. His book, StandOut of our Light, outlines the moral danger of the current \"attention economy\" in which capitalist interests vie constantly to distract us for their own enrichment. Williams told me that unless we find better ways to regulate and interact with the pernicious distractions of big tech, we risk compromising our personal and collective goals and values, even imperilling our own free will.</p><p>\"If what we attend to is, in a very real sense, what we are, then what's at stake in the battle for our attention is nothing less than our ability to determine and pursue the kinds of lives we want to live, both individually and societally,\" he said. As someone who, like me, grew up in a world without the internet, Williams worries that we will continue to \"conflate entertainment with leisure, resulting in fewer and fewer opportunities for reflection and introspection.\"</p><p>By resigning ourselves to the frenetic distractions of the attention economy, digital natives like my children and yours risk losing touch with the experience of what it is to be truly alone with their thoughts. Yes, their entertainment is more sophisticated than what we grew up with (what sane person would trade the bounty of Netflix for terrestrial Friends reruns?), but it's those empty, restless, vaguely melancholic hours, spent staring at clouds and lounging in trees, they'll miss. Not that they'll long for what they don't know. But we will, the innocents, aka the ones who recall the emptiness and boredom. For it's in those lost hours that we unwittingly got to know ourselves; our imaginations, unbridled, were free to play and laze and wander. And while it was dull and uneventful at times it's also true that all of humanity's wonders - including the internet itself - have arisen from this one simple source: a person, a thought, a daydream.</p><p>It's precisely this \"loss of lack\" Vancouver Michael Harris explores in The End of Absence. His experiments with regaining solitude remind me of my father's desk: go for a long walk without your phone, he recommends. Spend an afternoon writing in longhand. Read 150 pages in one sitting. Simple in theory, but strangely terrifying in practice.</p><p>Like Williams, Harris told me he doesn't consider himself anti-technology so much as a critical observer of its effects. He points out that all human inventions, even those we consider banal or beneficial, such as cars or books, hijack our brains and disrupt our consciousness. What we risk losing to the emergence of big data is the richness of our interior lives.</p><p>\"The experience of empty space allows for the growth of imagination and independent thought, the ability to form ideas without being swayed by mass opinion or bot armies,\" he said. Moreover, virtual connection impedes our ability to connect and empathise. \"When you are inundated with mediated social connectivity it's increasingly difficult to devote your attention to the people you are actually with.\"</p><p>More than anything, Harris worries that in future only the privileged few will be able to afford to take regular \"digital detoxes\" from the exhausting demands of the attention economy. As we talk, I think of my seven-year-old who, for the first time this summer, will fly with me to Ottawa then take a six-hour bus to the wilds of Northern Ontario where he will spend seven nights sleeping in a tent, canoeing and eating freeze-dried food cooked over a camp fire with 30 other kids. He won't have electricity and plumbing, let alone the internet. I won't disclose the fees except to say it isn't cheap to abandon a kid in the woods these days.</p><p>                       The ICO's Age Appropriate Design Code will be laid before parliament this autumn. If properly implemented and enforced, it may well make the internet a much safer, secure place for generations of British children to come. While it will, in theory, mean a vast improvement, even Denham's reimagined internet won't entirely reclaim our pre-digital innocence. No amount of legislating can give us back the absence of before. Which isn't to say innocence, or some version of it, can't be regained, through careful daily practice. Like the act of disconnecting our kids and sending them out to play in the garden. Or of sitting, just for an hour, at my father's empty desk.</p><p>                   Let's go digital                   </p><p>Key developments that changed the way we communicate.

Madrid </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">El avance incontestable de la transformaci\u00f3n digital ha provocado que ninguna actividad econ\u00f3mica se encuentre ya al margen de la innovaci\u00f3n. Incluso un sector tradicionalmente conservador, como el legal, atraviesa una etapa de cambios constantes que esboza nuevas perspectivas para sus profesionales. En este contexto, tanto los despachos de abogados como las asesor\u00edas jur\u00eddicas de las compa\u00f1\u00edas toman conciencia de que sus tareas, procesos y clientes plantean retos e interrogantes que las respuestas tradicionales no podr\u00e1n descifrar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Los expertos coinciden en que, por su propia naturaleza, la regulaci\u00f3n progresa a un ritmo m\u00e1s lento que la innovaci\u00f3n. De esta manera, el avance de la legislaci\u00f3n se mantiene siempre por detr\u00e1s de los cambios tecnol\u00f3gicos y sociales m\u00e1s disruptivos. Esta doble velocidad puede desembocar en un conflicto entre la normativa y la necesidad que tienen las compa\u00f1\u00edas de desarrollar y sacar el m\u00e1ximo partido de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, cuyo impacto repercute de forma casi inmediata en la sociedad.</p><h>Regulaci\u00f3n</h><p>Aunque ciertos principios deben mantenerse firmes a pesar de la innovaci\u00f3n, determinadas leyes han de perfeccionarse de la mano de la \u00faltima tecnolog\u00eda.  Internet y el uso de la inteligencia artificial deben ser regulados por normas modernas: es necesario actualizar el marco jur\u00eddico a nivel global , resalta Gabriel L\u00f3pez Serrano, director de asuntos regulatorios de Microsoft. A partir de esta convicci\u00f3n, la dificultad estriba en determinar qu\u00e9 tipo de normas son las m\u00e1s adecuadas, si las que anteponen la libertad del individuo o aquellas que dan prioridad a lo social. En este sentido, L\u00f3pez Serrano subraya que, en materia de privacidad, el modelo europeo se ha convertido en el est\u00e1ndar internacional.</p><p>En la misma l\u00ednea, Christoph Steck, director de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas e Internet de Telef\u00f3nica, a\u00f1ade que  Europa es l\u00edder mundial en la regulaci\u00f3n digital . En los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os, las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas aumentar\u00e1n su impacto en los entornos laborales y en la sociedad, hasta el punto de que la cuesti\u00f3n deber\u00e1 afrontarse desde el \u00e1mbito pol\u00edtico y regulatorio. As\u00ed, Steck asegura que  necesitamos una legislaci\u00f3n modernizada y un nuevo pacto digital basado en las personas y los valores existentes: no tenemos que reinventarlos sino aplicarlos al nuevo entorno .</p><p>Los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os han sido los del auge de los programas de compliance, que se han erigido en una alternativa para cristalizar la responsabilidad de las compa\u00f1\u00edas en el cumplimiento normativo y la prevenci\u00f3n de riesgos.  El problema es que no siempre obtienen el resultado perseguido y son una carga burocr\u00e1tica significativa: el modelo de compliance debe enfocarse m\u00e1s en definir lo \u00e9tico que en regular los propios procesos , considera Blanca Escribano, socia responsable de Digital Law de EY Abogados.</p><p>Por otra parte, en el sector financiero, la transformaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica ha tra\u00eddo consigo la entrada de nuevos competidores como las fintech o las big tech. Estas corporaciones, que ya han accedido al mercado, no operan bajo los mismos requisitos que las entidades de banca tradicional. Sobre esta problem\u00e1tica,  es clave que las mismas actividades y riesgos cuenten con las mismas normas y supervisores, de modo que la regulaci\u00f3n sea sim\u00e9trica , manifiesta Ana Jim\u00e9nez Molt\u00f3, directora de la asesor\u00eda jur\u00eddica de Santander Digital.</p><p>En el caso de la industria farmac\u00e9utica, la normativa de promoci\u00f3n y publicidad data del a\u00f1o 1994. En el entorno actual,  convivir con ciertas regulaciones limita en gran medida el desarrollo de la industria , argumenta Silvia Mart\u00ednez, directora del \u00e1rea legal de Bristol-Myers Squibb Espa\u00f1a. Asimismo, afirma que  dado que existen lagunas jur\u00eddicas, hay que recurrir a principios generales y \u00e9ticos para encontrar una soluci\u00f3n a los problemas actuales .</p><p>De forma inevitable, afrontar estos entornos cambiantes desde un ordenamiento jur\u00eddico antiguo da lugar a obst\u00e1culos considerables. En particular,  la situaci\u00f3n requiere que el derecho afronte la realidad actual y se debe regular de modo que principios \u00e9ticos comunes inspiren las normas jur\u00eddicas , puntualiza Sabiniano Medrano, socio de EY Abogados.</p><h>Proporcionalidad</h><p>En cuanto a los nuevos l\u00edmites de la responsabilidad frente al consumidor, los expertos indican que la tecnolog\u00eda genera un debate jur\u00eddico adicional. Como la cadena de responsabilidad ha ganado en complejidad, se antoja dif\u00edcil atribuirla sin perjudicar la innovaci\u00f3n.  Si se regula esta nueva realidad tecnol\u00f3gica, debe buscarse la proporcionalidad en la carga de responsabilidad que se atribuye a las empresas para no desincentivar la innovaci\u00f3n , concreta Blanca Escribano.</p><p>Sobre el mismo aspecto,  la legislaci\u00f3n de protecci\u00f3n del consumidor ha evolucionado, pero requiere que se adapte y se haga extensiva a los nuevos modelos de negocio , seg\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez Molt\u00f3. Por otro lado,  nuestra responsabilidad es continuar trabajando con el regulador para favorecer que puedan existir canales \u00e1giles para facilitar informaci\u00f3n objetiva, transparente y en tiempo real , aclara Silvia Mart\u00ednez.</p><p>Acerca de los cambios que ha introducido la tecnolog\u00eda, Christoph Steck incide en la capa de datos en el caso de las operadoras de telecomunicaciones.  Resulta necesaria una nueva \u00e9tica de datos que posibilite que cada persona decida c\u00f3mo y cu\u00e1ndo se utilizan los suyos , matiza el responsable de Telef\u00f3nica. Aunque la disponibilidad de los datos se ha multiplicado,  el uso de la tecnolog\u00eda debe ser responsable y estar basado en principios para que no perdamos la confianza del cliente , reconoce Gabriel L\u00f3pez Serrano.</p><p>Adem\u00e1s de esto, los propios profesionales tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n expuestos a las modificaciones que provoca la transformaci\u00f3n digital.  El cambio tecnol\u00f3gico afecta a todas las profesiones y constituye un reto porque nos obliga a adquirir nuevas habilidades y terminolog\u00edas , concluye Sabiniano Medrano, socio de EY Abogados.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPNSN-16712080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPNSN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNF-V3C1-JCR6-R023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">310181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Recoletos Grupo de Comunicaci\u00f3n S.A.

While agriculture still dominates, and high profile social problems still exist in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, many industries are thriving, and Brazil accounts for several world-leading organizations in fields as diverse as brewing to airplane manufacturing to mobile technology. In 2012, rumors swirled around the tech industry that the next iPhone upgrade was to be put together in Brazil, not the traditionally strong tech manufacturer in the BRIC group China.</p><p>So just what is the real picture of Brazilian innovation in 2012? In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Factor inputs</emphasis> . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demand conditions</emphasis> . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related and supporting industries</emphasis> . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Firm strategy and rivalry</emphasis> . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macro vs micro</emphasis></p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brazil in limbo</emphasis></p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> , 2011). Concentrating specifically on the financial restrictions firms in Brazil found themselves under, the authors take a historical view of how the country developed in a period of turmoil and ultimately growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and assess if international models hold that as constraints increase, innovation is stifled.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the authors do indeed find that innovation among Brazilian firms was adversely affected by these constraints, and portray a very mixed picture of many firms struggling to break out of their national market to compete, while others took advantage of the economy to flourish, but overall the results were unsatisfactory for a large country seeking some stability and the opportunity to plan growth in a controlled, sustainable way. It is evident from the article that the Brazilian government was aware of this and tried to deregulate markets to improve conditions for innovation, however it did not seem to have such a positive effect due to poor general market conditions and information problems in certain markets.</p><p>Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>  conclude that improved corporate governance and information flow on behalf of firms, and improved regulation to help shape favorable environmental conditions on behalf of legislators, should combine to help promote innovation in Brazil. From all three articles reviewed here, it is clear there is a massive opportunity for Brazil to grasp the nettle and set sight on a course to narrow any innovation gap and improve their standing among the world's economies, but that long-term thinking and decision-making are required by governments and the public sector. Sadly, these bodies are renowned for short-term political decision-making, and it is to be hoped they innovate their thinking as well as their firms innovate their product and service offers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comment</emphasis></p><p>The articles reviewed here offer an incredibly deep insight into how Brazil has overcome several barriers to innovation over the last two decades. In particular, the articles are worth reading in more depth, as well as the cited literature, to specifically understand how the country has been affected by the global financial crisis, and what areas will see significant growth in the near future.</p><p>1.

Brazil has been the focus for many industry leaders seeking significant growth numbers for their organizations, as it has many of the right ingredients for long term development: a large population, a rapidly developing middle class, a growing industrial output and a relatively stable economy.

What is research output like? How many patents were filed in previous years? What is upcoming higher education restructuring likely to entail? All these questions and more will either halt a firm's entry into Brazil for fear that it's need for innovation will not be met, or could push it into significant foreign direct investment (FDI) as it bets the farm on developing the next big tech company or logistics game changer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More than samba and soccer</emphasis></p><p>Despite the big numbers, there is still a good deal of hesitation over FDI in Brazil, which is largely due to ignorance of life in the country. While agriculture still dominates, and high profile social problems still exist in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, many industries are thriving, and Brazil accounts for several world-leading organizations in fields as diverse as brewing to airplane manufacturing to mobile technology. In 2012, rumors swirled around the tech industry that the next iPhone upgrade was to be put together in Brazil, not the traditionally strong tech manufacturer in the BRIC group China.</p><p>So just what is the real picture of Brazilian innovation in 2012? In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Factor inputs</emphasis> . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demand conditions</emphasis> . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related and supporting industries</emphasis> . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Firm strategy and rivalry</emphasis> . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macro vs micro</emphasis></p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brazil in limbo</emphasis></p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> , 2011). Concentrating specifically on the financial restrictions firms in Brazil found themselves under, the authors take a historical view of how the country developed in a period of turmoil and ultimately growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and assess if international models hold that as constraints increase, innovation is stifled.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the authors do indeed find that innovation among Brazilian firms was adversely affected by these constraints, and portray a very mixed picture of many firms struggling to break out of their national market to compete, while others took advantage of the economy to flourish, but overall the results were unsatisfactory for a large country seeking some stability and the opportunity to plan growth in a controlled, sustainable way. It is evident from the article that the Brazilian government was aware of this and tried to deregulate markets to improve conditions for innovation, however it did not seem to have such a positive effect due to poor general market conditions and information problems in certain markets.</p><p>Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>  conclude that improved corporate governance and information flow on behalf of firms, and improved regulation to help shape favorable environmental conditions on behalf of legislators, should combine to help promote innovation in Brazil. From all three articles reviewed here, it is clear there is a massive opportunity for Brazil to grasp the nettle and set sight on a course to narrow any innovation gap and improve their standing among the world's economies, but that long-term thinking and decision-making are required by governments and the public sector. Sadly, these bodies are renowned for short-term political decision-making, and it is to be hoped they innovate their thinking as well as their firms innovate their product and service offers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comment</emphasis></p><p>The articles reviewed here offer an incredibly deep insight into how Brazil has overcome several barriers to innovation over the last two decades. In particular, the articles are worth reading in more depth, as well as the cited literature, to specifically understand how the country has been affected by the global financial crisis, and what areas will see significant growth in the near future.</p><p>1.

In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p>Factor inputs  . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p>Demand conditions  . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p>Related and supporting industries  . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p>Firm strategy and rivalry  . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p>Macro vs micro </p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p>Brazil in limbo </p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo et al.  , 2011). Concentrating specifically on the financial restrictions firms in Brazil found themselves under, the authors take a historical view of how the country developed in a period of turmoil and ultimately growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and assess if international models hold that as constraints increase, innovation is stifled.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the authors do indeed find that innovation among Brazilian firms was adversely affected by these constraints, and portray a very mixed picture of many firms struggling to break out of their national market to compete, while others took advantage of the economy to flourish, but overall the results were unsatisfactory for a large country seeking some stability and the opportunity to plan growth in a controlled, sustainable way. It is evident from the article that the Brazilian government was aware of this and tried to deregulate markets to improve conditions for innovation, however it did not seem to have such a positive effect due to poor general market conditions and information problems in certain markets.</p><p>Crisostomo et al.   conclude that improved corporate governance and information flow on behalf of firms, and improved regulation to help shape favorable environmental conditions on behalf of legislators, should combine to help promote innovation in Brazil. From all three articles reviewed here, it is clear there is a massive opportunity for Brazil to grasp the nettle and set sight on a course to narrow any innovation gap and improve their standing among the world's economies, but that long-term thinking and decision-making are required by governments and the public sector. Sadly, these bodies are renowned for short-term political decision-making, and it is to be hoped they innovate their thinking as well as their firms innovate their product and service offers.</p><p>Comment </p><p>The articles reviewed here offer an incredibly deep insight into how Brazil has overcome several barriers to innovation over the last two decades. In particular, the articles are worth reading in more depth, as well as the cited literature, to specifically understand how the country has been affected by the global financial crisis, and what areas will see significant growth in the near future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABI-2783842701</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">2783842701 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59R3-3P01-DYBW-216C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 ProQuest Information and Learning Company<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited</copyright><publicationName>Development &amp;

Brazil has been the focus for many industry leaders seeking significant growth numbers for their organizations, as it has many of the right ingredients for long term development. A large population, a rapidly developing middle class, a growing industrial output and a relatively stable economy. In fact, in 2011 it became the world's seventh largest economy displacing the UK, and this was despite GDP falling from over 7 per cent in 2010 to just 2.5 per cent in 2011. Practical implications - The article provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations.

What is research output like? How many patents were filed in previous years? What is upcoming higher education restructuring likely to entail? All these questions and more will either halt a firm's entry into Brazil for fear that it's need for innovation will not be met, or could push it into significant foreign direct investment (FDI) as it bets the farm on developing the next big tech company or logistics game changer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More than samba and soccer</emphasis></p><p>Despite the big numbers, there is still a good deal of hesitation over FDI in Brazil, which is largely due to ignorance of life in the country. While agriculture still dominates, and high profile social problems still exist in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, many industries are thriving, and Brazil accounts for several world-leading organizations in fields as diverse as brewing to airplane manufacturing to mobile technology. In 2012, rumors swirled around the tech industry that the next iPhone upgrade was to be put together in Brazil, not the traditionally strong tech manufacturer in the BRIC group China.</p><p>So just what is the real picture of Brazilian innovation in 2012? In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Factor inputs</emphasis> . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demand conditions</emphasis> . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related and supporting industries</emphasis> . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Firm strategy and rivalry</emphasis> . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macro vs micro</emphasis></p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brazil in limbo</emphasis></p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> , 2011).

Brazil has been the focus for many industry leaders seeking significant growth numbers for their organizations, as it has many of the right ingredients for long term development: a large population, a rapidly developing middle class, a growing industrial output and a relatively stable economy. In fact, in 2011 it became the world's seventh largest economy displacing the UK, and this was despite GDP falling from over 7 percent in 2010 to just 2.5 percent in 2011.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">              However for many companies, the statistics they are keen to spot are those, which will tell them what the conditions are like for innovation. What is research output like? How many patents were filed in previous years? What is upcoming higher education restructuring likely to entail? All these questions and more will either halt a firm's entry into Brazil for fear that it's need for innovation will not be met, or could push it into significant foreign direct investment (FDI) as it bets the farm on developing the next big tech company or logistics game changer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">              More than samba and soccer</p><p>              Despite the big numbers, there is still a good deal of hesitation over FDI in Brazil, which is largely due to ignorance of life in the country. While agriculture still dominates, and high profile social problems still exist in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, many industries are thriving, and Brazil accounts for several world-leading organizations in fields as diverse as brewing to airplane manufacturing to mobile technology. In 2012, rumors swirled around the tech industry that the next iPhone upgrade was to be put together in Brazil, not the traditionally strong tech manufacturer in the BRIC group China.</p><p>              So just what is the real picture of Brazilian innovation in 2012? In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>              However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p>              Factor inputs . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p>              Demand conditions . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p>              Related and supporting industries . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p>              Firm strategy and rivalry . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p>              Macro vs micro</p><p>              Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>              Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>              Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>              - Longer established.</p><p>              - Had access to public funding.</p><p>              - Had continuous export programs.</p><p>              - Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p>               The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p>              Brazil in limbo</p><p>              Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo et al. , 2011). Concentrating specifically on the financial restrictions firms in Brazil found themselves under, the authors take a historical view of how the country developed in a period of turmoil and ultimately growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and assess if international models hold that as constraints increase, innovation is stifled.</p><p>              Perhaps unsurprisingly, the authors do indeed find that innovation among Brazilian firms was adversely affected by these constraints, and portray a very mixed picture of many firms struggling to break out of their national market to compete, while others took advantage of the economy to flourish, but overall the results were unsatisfactory for a large country seeking some stability and the opportunity to plan growth in a controlled, sustainable way. It is evident from the article that the Brazilian government was aware of this and tried to deregulate markets to improve conditions for innovation, however it did not seem to have such a positive effect due to poor general market conditions and information problems in certain markets.</p><p>              Crisostomo et al.  conclude that improved corporate governance and information flow on behalf of firms, and improved regulation to help shape favorable environmental conditions on behalf of legislators, should combine to help promote innovation in Brazil. From all three articles reviewed here, it is clear there is a massive opportunity for Brazil to grasp the nettle and set sight on a course to narrow any innovation gap and improve their standing among the world's economies, but that long-term thinking and decision-making are required by governments and the public sector. Sadly, these bodies are renowned for short-term political decision-making, and it is to be hoped they innovate their thinking as well as their firms innovate their product and service offers.</p><p>              Comment</p><p>              The articles reviewed here offer an incredibly deep insight into how Brazil has overcome several barriers to innovation over the last two decades. In particular, the articles are worth reading in more depth, as well as the cited literature, to specifically understand how the country has been affected by the global financial crisis, and what areas will see significant growth in the near future.</p><p/><p>1.

In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system.

In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Factor inputs</emphasis> . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demand conditions</emphasis> . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related and supporting industries</emphasis> . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Firm strategy and rivalry</emphasis> . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macro vs micro</emphasis></p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brazil in limbo</emphasis></p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> , 2011). Concentrating specifically on the financial restrictions firms in Brazil found themselves under, the authors take a historical view of how the country developed in a period of turmoil and ultimately growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and assess if international models hold that as constraints increase, innovation is stifled.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the authors do indeed find that innovation among Brazilian firms was adversely affected by these constraints, and portray a very mixed picture of many firms struggling to break out of their national market to compete, while others took advantage of the economy to flourish, but overall the results were unsatisfactory for a large country seeking some stability and the opportunity to plan growth in a controlled, sustainable way. It is evident from the article that the Brazilian government was aware of this and tried to deregulate markets to improve conditions for innovation, however it did not seem to have such a positive effect due to poor general market conditions and information problems in certain markets.</p><p>Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>  conclude that improved corporate governance and information flow on behalf of firms, and improved regulation to help shape favorable environmental conditions on behalf of legislators, should combine to help promote innovation in Brazil. From all three articles reviewed here, it is clear there is a massive opportunity for Brazil to grasp the nettle and set sight on a course to narrow any innovation gap and improve their standing among the world's economies, but that long-term thinking and decision-making are required by governments and the public sector. Sadly, these bodies are renowned for short-term political decision-making, and it is to be hoped they innovate their thinking as well as their firms innovate their product and service offers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comment</emphasis></p><p>The articles reviewed here offer an incredibly deep insight into how Brazil has overcome several barriers to innovation over the last two decades. In particular, the articles are worth reading in more depth, as well as the cited literature, to specifically understand how the country has been affected by the global financial crisis, and what areas will see significant growth in the near future.</p><p>1.

Brazil has been the focus for many industry leaders seeking significant growth numbers for their organizations, as it has many of the right ingredients for long term development. A large population, a rapidly developing middle class, a growing industrial output and a relatively stable economy.

While agriculture still dominates, and high profile social problems still exist in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, many industries are thriving, and Brazil accounts for several world-leading organizations in fields as diverse as brewing to airplane manufacturing to mobile technology. In 2012, rumors swirled around the tech industry that the next iPhone upgrade was to be put together in Brazil, not the traditionally strong tech manufacturer in the BRIC group China.</p><p>So just what is the real picture of Brazilian innovation in 2012? In their article \"Bridging the innovation divide: the Brazilian experience\" ([2] Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2012), Gouvea and Kassicieh provide an overview of the innovation landscape in Brazil, looking at both the opportunities that lie within this large country, but also the challenges that could hold back further rapid innovation-fuelled growth. In order to do this, the authors present no fewer than eight factors that determine the levels of innovation, and in turn the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy. These include institutional roles, lack of transparency in business dealings, the state of the country's infrastructure, the effectiveness of the financial markets and the quality of the education system. From an assessment of these factors, it is evident that there are several checks and balances operating together which could easily stifle the undoubted potential that exists within the country.</p><p>However factors such as these tend to ignore the status of global competitors operating outside the country, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the perception of innovation capabilities. In order to properly appraise Brazil's performance, the authors look to adopt the so-called \"innovation diamond model\" developed by seminal management thinker Michael Porter, and uncover the following four main characteristics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Factor inputs</emphasis> . Overall these are good, with Brazil ranking quite highly in areas such as internet users per 10,000 people (47th) and PCs per 100 inhabitants (35th). Brazil does score quite low for the number of utility patents per million of population (59th), however the authors point to the country's different patent system as skewing the figures somewhat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demand conditions</emphasis> . This points mainly to areas such as government procurement, where Brazil has a poor ranking of 60th, and is evidently lagging behind many of its competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related and supporting industries</emphasis> . This points to so-called clusters, and Brazil has had success in investing in areas such as manufacturing and communication technologies, with a ranking overall of 29th. Where it has seen particular growth is in agriculture, where it has transformed from being a net importer of food in the 1970s to the world's second biggest exporter in 2010. This has been due in no small part to the creation of a massive research cooperative, which has beeen highly funded and packed full of experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Firm strategy and rivalry</emphasis> . Again, Brazil does not fare well in this dimension, with its ability to protect intellectual property down at 92nd in the world. However there were signs of improvement in some areas, such as legal development around information technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macro vs micro</emphasis></p><p>Gouvea and Kassicieh conclude that Brazil is at a crossroads in its development of innovation, and needs to promote the role of the private sector in innovation and improve cooperation between it, the government and universities to avoid falling the wrong side of the innovation divide. In a memorable quote, the authors say, \"Technological innovation is the only source for long-term, sustainable growth in Brazil\". Given this summation for Brazil, what of its competitors in the rest of Latin America, who are perceived of as being behind Brazil in most aspects of innovation and global competitiveness?</p><p>Two areas not covered by Gouvea and Kassicieh but which have an enormous impact on how innovation is developing in Brazil are the micro-economic factors at play among individual companies and industrial sectors, and the wide economic environment in the shape of the peculiar conditions created by the global financial crisis. In her article \"The global crisis and firms\" investments in innovation' ([3] Paunov, 2011), Paunov looks at both of these areas for Brazil and - crucially - seven other countries in South and Central America: Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. This snapshot of how industries themselves go about developing innovation provides a deep insight into not only how Brazil stacks up against some of its main competitors such as Mexico, but also how the whole region is gearing itself up for the holy grail of sustainable development through technological innovation.</p><p>Paunov looks at the aftershocks of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the unanswered questions surrounding the impact on innovation in Latin America. In particular, the author is interested in which firms were most affected by the fallout, and where they were located. Following a massive data exercise to uncover the relevant information, the main findings were that firms more likely to continue their innovation programs were:</p><p>- Longer established.</p><p>- Had access to public funding.</p><p>- Had continuous export programs.</p><p>- Supplied multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p><p> The implications of these findings are that smaller, newer firms with limited foreign exposure should be targeted by Latin American governments in order that their innovation programs are not killed off, thus harming not only their long-term prospects, but the prospects of the countries themselves to bridge the innovation divide in the developing world. While it was difficult to identify which countries were most at threat, evidence suggested that firms in Latin America were at least positive about returning to their innovation programs in the near future, and on the whole were resilient to such yo-yoing in their innovation strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brazil in limbo</emphasis></p><p>Returning to Brazil, the idea of just how great external factors can be on providing barriers for innovation is addressed by Crisostomo, Lopez-Iturriaga and Vallelado in their article \"Financial constraints for innovation in Brazil\" ([1] Crisostomo <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> , 2011).

Almost every cargo ship, tractor and bulldozer in the world runs on diesel today.</p><p>Shortly before his death, Diesel wrote a letter bemoaning his fate as someone who had defied convention and tried to do things differently. Introducing an invention, he explained, \u201cis a time fraught with combating stupidity and jealousy, inertia and venom, furtive resistance and an open conflict of interests, an appalling time spent battling with people, a martyrdom to be overcome, even if the invention is a success\u201d.</p><p>Diesel was, according to Matt Ridley, an \u201cinnovation hero\u201d who not only helped to produce more efficient engines but also envisaged radically new, if less successful, ways of organising worker-run factories. But his frustrating experience was an extreme form of a challenge confronting all those who seek to innovate.\u00a0</p><p>While innovation is almost universally hailed as a desirable objective, why is it so hard to achieve in practice? Why is it, in Diesel\u2019s words, so often \u201ca martyrdom\u201d rather than an inspiration to be encouraged?</p><p>In truth, Ridley never fully answers the questions he raises, partly, no doubt, because it is such a complex subject. Nevertheless, his book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Innovation Works</emphasis> is an entertaining attempt to explore what innovation is, how it works and why it is resisted.\u00a0</p><p>Firmly in the neo-optimist school of commentators, alongside the likes of Steven Pinker and the late Hans Rosling, Ridley argues that innovation is the unacknowledged \u201cinfinite improbability drive\u201d (of the science-fiction writer Douglas Adams\u2019 imagining) that powers the modern economy.</p><p>\u201cPause in awe at what innovation does,\u201d Ridley enthuses. In 1900 an American man would \u2014 on average \u2014 start work at 14, spend 25 per cent of his life in back-breaking toil and die aged 47. Today, his modern equivalent spends half his time in education or retirement, works 10 per cent of his hours on earth and dies aged 80. That change is almost entirely due to the wondrous power of innovation.</p><p>Packed with insightful examples, Ridley\u2019s book explores the stories behind innovations as varied as fertiliser, vaccinations, corrugated iron, shipping containers and sliced bread, and the development of fracking, nuclear power, search engines and gene editing. Although these stories are often told through the lives of individuals, Ridley insists that we should think of innovation in a less personalised way, stressing that it is almost always a collective enterprise, a team sport.</p><p>Even if Google\u2019s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had never been born, we would still have powerful search engines, Ridley contends. Innovation, he writes, is typically incremental, gradual, serendipitous and inexorable. It is not so much about one eureka moment as thousands of trial-and-error experiments. It is far more about natural selection than intelligent design.</p><p>Ridley usefully emphasises the distinction between invention and innovation. Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press but Martin Luther was the innovator in how to use it. It was Luther who helped turn an obscure pastime for the ecclesiastical elite into a mass-market publishing phenomenon. \u201cLike Jeff Bezos at Amazon or Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, he had realised the potential of a new technology on a huge scale,\u201d writes Ridley.</p><p>The book is also engaging on how new innovations often spark resistance. Potatoes were for a while rejected by English Protestants as agents of Roman Catholic influence. More recently, the EU banned genetically modified foods, caving in, as Ridley sees it, to public fears of \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d.</p><p>Where he is less sure-footed, and at times contradictory, is on how to tackle our current \u201cinnovation famine\u201d. His account is too simplistic, drawing cartoon heroes and villains. Short-sighted managers, fee-hungry patent lawyers and fearful bureaucrats are fair game for criticism. But Ridley glosses over arguments for the precautionary principle of regulation, which suggests innovations should be subject to scrutiny before mass adoption, even though recent experiences with social media and artificial intelligence suggest that it might be a good idea.\u00a0</p><p>Ridley preaches that the main ingredient in the secret sauce of innovation is freedom. Freedom to express counter-intuitive opinions and experiment are vital but so is freedom from government interference and regulation. \u201cAs always, regulation favours incumbents,\u201d he asserts, failing to acknowledge that much anti-trust regulation is explicitly designed to cut incumbents down to size and promote insurgents.\u00a0</p><p>Similarly, while trumpeting the virtues of freedom, he lavishes praise on China\u2019s innovation machine, although he does footnote that the country\u2019s political authoritarianism may one day catch up with it.</p><p>As a confirmed Brexiter, Ridley is naturally hostile to the EU, ignoring the scale advantages of the single market. Modern industrial strategy, of the kind advocated by Mariana Mazzucato in her book The Entrepreneurial State, is dismissed as the economic equivalent of creationism.</p><p>Ridley\u2019s book is a powerful corrective to the growing chorus of economists who demand that the state should become increasingly interventionist in response to the current crisis. He is right that we should not allow state or corporate managerialism to crowd out the space for individual initiative, experimental enterprise and permissionless innovation to flourish. Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cperennial gale of creative destruction\u201d should not be replaced by the \u201cgentle breezes of rent-seeking\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Some of the counterarguments to Ridley\u2019s case are implicitly made by two other books on innovation and the internet, also written by journalists. Like Ridley\u2019s book, they are both readable but frustratingly incomplete, long on anecdote and short on analysis.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Smoke &amp; Mirrors</emphasis>, Gemma Milne wanders through nine areas of science and technology with an expert eye, puncturing all the balloons of hyped expectations. Many of the hottest areas of tech investment, including vertical farming, fusion energy, quantum computing, brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence, are all subject to her healthy and informed scepticism.\u00a0</p><p>All too often investment in technology reflects the faddish wish list of the rich and powerful rather than the objective real-world needs of society. Hype often determines those fads, conceals complexity and reinforces existing power structures.</p><p>Ridley would surely counter that the experts in many of these fields, who are so dismissive of media and investor hype, have themselves a terrible record of predicting the course of innovation. The amateur innovator, able to spot the mass applications of new technologies, can sometimes see further than the original inventor.</p><p>Ironically, Milne overstates her case and hypes her own argument. \u201cThere are many stories of lying, deception and misuse of power, but I\u2019d argue that hype can be even more damaging than deliberate, sometimes criminal, actions,\u201d she writes. Really? On the evidence presented in this book, most readers would very probably return a Scottish verdict of not proven.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The System</emphasis>, James Ball takes a similarly critical look at who runs the internet. Its earliest champions believed the internet would be the \u201cthing of revolution\u201d, encouraging a new wave of radical innovation in almost every field. Instead it has been captured by the powers that be and turned into an instrument of control, Ball argues. \u201cThe internet, left unchecked, is a monopoly-making machine, an engine designed to concentrate power, attention and more in the hands of those who already have it,\u201d he writes.</p><p>His book is a sprightly history of the internet seen from the perspective of its inventors, investors, custodians, rule-makers and rebels. Its initial growth was glacial before becoming too fast to see. Today, about half the world\u2019s population has access to the internet using a total of 25bn-30bn connected devices. As Ball puts it, the internet has evolved from being a closed community of US government employees and academic researchers, to a fringe activity of nerds, to the bright shining hope of capitalism, to critical global infrastructure.</p><p>That astonishing growth would conform to Ridley\u2019s notions of innovation owing more to serendipity and experimentation rather than top-down design and control. \u201cShort-term solutions tend to stay with us for a very long time. And long-term solutions tend to never happen,\u201d according to an engineer involved in developing the internet\u2019s protocols.\u00a0</p><p>However, as Ball explains, the lack of infrastructural and governance bedrock is worrisome now that the internet has become the cornerstone of the global economy. Some form of concerted intervention is also required to prevent the Big Tech companies from buying up all those digital start-ups that might one day supplant them and killing the innovation cycle.\u00a0</p><p>Ball recommends that we should pay far more attention to how the internet works and not allow ourselves to be \u201cbamboozled into inaction\u201d as we were with the finance industry before the 2008 crash. We should also treat the Big Tech companies as regular corporations that should be subject to regulation just as previous oligopolists were.\u00a0</p><p>The overall lesson from these books is that innovation is an extremely powerful force for positive change that should be more explicitly acknowledged and encouraged. Governments should listen more to the insurgents and resist being captured by the incumbents.</p><p>But governments, regulators and civil society organisations do have a legitimate and essential role in deciding how some innovations are released into the wild and how they are deployed.</p><p>In the mid-2010s, the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel argued that we lived in a world in which \u201cbits were unregulated and atoms were regulated\u201d. That explained the phenomenal growth of the computer software industry and the sluggishness of pharmaceutical drug development, he argued.</p><p>But real life is more complicated than theory. No one would swallow an unregulated drug. And, as the US Congress has recently made clear, politicians are increasingly moving into the business of regulating bits, whether the tech industry likes it or not. </p><p>The challenge will be how best to protect vital societal interests without stifling permission less innovation. It will be one of the most difficult and demanding challenges of our times.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Innovation-Works-Serendipity-Energy/dp/0008334811/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=112275362308&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0a_QwKyV6wIVhu7tCh1t_Am5EAAYASAAEgJ-X_D_BwE&amp;hvadid=446587512209&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1006886&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=12668698228788891750&amp;hvtargid=kwd-881721845210&amp;hydadcr=18520_1817330&amp;keywords=how+innovation+works+matt+ridley&amp;qid=1597224387&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=googhydr-21\"> How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom, by Matt Ridley</url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fourth Estate RRP\u00a320, 406 pages</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1472143663?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1472143663\">Smoke &amp;

Among the answers: partnership, agility and \u201cintuitive\u201d digital solutions.      \u201cWe wanted to get the curiosity going in all colleagues about what was happening in tech, and how that is shaping the future of banking and payments,\u201d said Ruchir Rodrigues. \u201cAnd also get an outside-in view.\u201d    The Global Head of Digital and Platforms was speaking about the bank\u2019s Digital Unleashed series , in which leaders from within Barclays were joined by experts from Big Tech to discuss the future of financial services.    One \u201coutside-in\u201d view was provided by Brian Cole, Head of North American Products at Visa. Addressing the question of whether the boom of investment in new fintechs is sustainable, he said: \u201cThe fintech rush will continue for as long as there are problems that need to be solved. There are already problems that we know need to be solved, never mind the problems we haven\u2019t seen yet.\u201d    For Barclays, this is tied to consumer expectations and the need to develop solutions that can scale quickly. With Rodrigues pointing out that \u201cthe pace of change accelerates every day\u201d, Denny Nealon, President at Barclays US Consumer Bank, said that the bank\u2019s intention was to \u201cout-fintech the fintechs\u201d.      \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t deliver equivalent merchant and customer experiences, but they don\u2019t have the balance sheet that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental benefit we have, and that\u2019s an opportunity we have to deliver things in a digital-first, intuitive way.\u201d    \u201cCan we move at pace?\u201d he continued. \u201cCan we keep up with the fast pace of the payments industry? We invest a lot in our technology platforms and in reinventing how we do business and being more agile. But it can\u2019t stop there. If we think we have to build everything, we\u2019re in trouble.    \u201cWe can\u2019t own every element of the chain \u2013 it would slow us down, we wouldn\u2019t have best-in-class products for our customers. It\u2019s a question of how we balance the need to own, and at the same time take the advantage of other companies delivering best-in-class capabilities. We have to keep knocking down barriers to building at pace.\u201d    Asked by Rodrigues \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in the investment side for fintechs?\u201d, Amir Goldman, Founder and Managing Director of Susquehanna Growth Equity, said: \u201cFor those of us who were around and active during the dot com bubble of 1999, there was a lot of garbage there, but if we had bought 10 internet stocks, we would have been really happy now and really rich. I think that the fintech revolution in a lot of ways hit that same modality.    \u201cThe way we look at it as investors is, there are certain companies that I believe are in a bubble and they happen to be companies that compete with big banks. Those companies to me were created out of the post 2007 crisis vacuum but they\u2019re inherently and structurally disadvantaged versus the bank. On the other hand, any company that\u2019s able to take advantage of beautiful user interfaces and agile technology developments and customer experience \u2013 those are the ones that are going to create a lot of value.\u201d   High stakes and staying nimble   The emphasis on partnership \u2013 whether with fintechs, with customers like Uber, or with service providers like AWS and Salesforce \u2013 was seen as key to keeping ahead of the payments landscape.    Karoline Kane, Chief Operating Officer, Cards and Payments, said that in the last two years, Barclays has transformed the way it delivers technology: \u201cIt\u2019s all about speed of execution and not feeling like we have to own it all from end to end. Because there are best-in-class partners that we can work with. We\u2019ve proved with our integration with Uber that we can do it very nimbly \u2013 we did it in 150 days, and continuing that mindset to test and learn, fail fast, move on and succeed is what we have to do.\u201d    Nealon warned of the high stakes involved in getting services right, saying \u201cthe expectations of our partners and customers are becoming more and more digital, and are changing every day. We have to keep pace with that kind of movement in the customer experience. The opportunity is to make best-in-class experiences driving more customers to payment products . We have to deliver that in a way that is intuitive to people.    \u201cPeople have learned to expect to do all sorts of things on their phone, and when a company can\u2019t deliver that we\u2019re not going to hear a complaint \u2013 they\u2019re just going to stop using.\u201d    He concluded by reiterating the need for partnerships with the new kids on the block: \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to want to be the builder, but the more you can take from partners, the more likely you are to be able to offer the full palette.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Despite the operating environment, our core business re- mained strong and thanks to the growth strategy we put in place, we made good progress in diversifying our revenue streams and in maintaining a strong balance sheet. We achieved a healthy loan growth, have the best spreads in the market, recorded strong fee income growth of RO39.2 million, a 13.5 per cent increase. The banks robust capital position was demonstrated when NBOs core ratio was at a stable 12.6 per cent against the regulatory requirement of 8.81 per cent. We will continue to deliver the internal lean management program Al Jawda that introduced continuous processes improvements through the elimination of waste process manage- ment with a greater focus on quality. Also, NBO made substantial enhance- ments to the banks trade finance operations to deliver a superior banking experience by restructuring our existing processes, enhance the employees skills, and re-aligning our business model to match our customers needs.</p><p>As the only Omani bank operating in the UAE, we created a business environment which best suits our customers in the UAE and in Oman by making banking more seamless, productive and efficient. We introduced a value proposition that is designed to simplify cross-border banking transactions between the UAE and Oman. We also implemented various initiatives to de-risk the UAE book and to ensure we maintain quality assets.</p><p>In addition, we have also focused on em- powering our people, enhancing our pro- cesses and technology. We strengthened our leadership team in the UAE with key roles to ensure we have effective oper-</p><p>ational controls in place. We completed a comprehensive due diligence exercise across all accounts and enhanced our existing policies and procedures.</p><p>By adopting a prudent risk management approach that includes ongoing monitoring and early warning indicators to mitigate potential risks. This is a key focus area for NBO.</p><p>What were the major milestones during the year? In 2017, we continued to make headway in our transformation process, a process we began some years ago. Our aim is to provide convenience, easy and innovative solutions that will improve the quality of our customers lives. I am very proud to say that we have been able to achieve what we set out and are ahead of the industry due to our multi-dimensional vision with a three-pronged approach that addresses providing compelling solutions, superior customer experience and a first-class workforce.</p><p>We provided our customers with compelling solutions that best fit their lifestyle. We demonstrated our commitment and dedication to them through helping them grow their businesses, cash management, providing strategic advisory on key merger and acquisition deals or wealth management for high net worth clients. Our Islamic banking window, Muzn was voted as the Best Islamic Banking Service Provider in Oman because customers appreciated the value of the new private banking offering. To expand our reach to other GCC markets, we invested in improving our operations in the UAE market. As the only Omani bank present in the UAE, NBO designed an exclusive service to simplify cross-border banking transactions between Oman and the UAE. Through a seamless banking approach, it allowed companies in both countries to safely and securely make instant fund transfers from their NBO accounts to any bank account in either country.</p><p>We have taken a step further when it comes to our customers, we embedded ourselves in their journey. This has helped us better respond to their needs and wants. We also knew that digital transformation was an important component of the customers journey and decided that investing in it will make their lives easier. The number of customers using our digital banking rose by more than 90 per cent, our mobile and online banking solutions now account for more than 60 per cent of all customer transactions. We also launched wearable banking, cards marketplace, and a Twitter enquiry services. The mobile app became the center of our efforts in the digital banking; we are planning to utilize the app further to provide customers with value-added services to enhance their experiences. The latter includes ensuring complete digitalisation, establishing a solid data infrastructure and integrating the usage of AI technology. We listened to our customers and used their feedback to build a system that fit their lifestyle.</p><p>The Bank was the first in Oman to have successfully completed the international remittances pilot project using block- chain technology. Furthermore, our efforts in the digital sector was recognized when we received the Asian Banker Technology Innovation Award for our customer relationship management.</p><p>At the center of the most forward- thinking, dynamic and successful workplaces is people. We are transforming our organization to nurture a high performance team who are empowered and are equipped with the right skillsets. We invested heavily in upping their skills, in running talent development programs and in building a headquarters that will act as an incubation hub for talent generation and a place where they can solve our customers problem. Our customers and employees make up the very fabric of the community we operate in. We have worked hard to build relationships with public and private entities to support the Sultanates long- term economic diversification agenda. We have done so through supporting numerous initiatives, events, and sponsorships such as the NBO Golf Classic Championship, Ahmad Al Harthy and most recently the NBO Golf Open. Through these joined efforts, we have promoted the Sultanate to a global audience and put Oman on the world sporting map. We were also the first to host the Sultanates biggest hackathon where over 300 students, startups and entrepreneurs competed against each other to produce the next big tech driven idea that will shape the future of banking.</p><p>One major milestone is the new headquarters office in Azaiba which is considered a construction marvel. The building incorporates the Omani culture and spirit in its design as it was built with special limestone blocks that are popular in Oman. It is equipped with the latest technologies to accommodate the market need for an advanced, healthy, beautiful, and efficient working environment which will reflect on our employees performance and the quality of service provided by NBO.</p><p>The Bank was also acknowledged by receiving several accolades. These included being recognized by Citibank for US dollar (USD) fund transfer services and Barclays Bank for Great British Pound remittance services.</p><p>How was your retail and corporate lending during the year? The bank took several measures including re-pricing existing loans and increasing on-boarding yields for corporate customers. As a result, the Banks interest margins are the best in the industry. We maintained strict vigil over asset quality and de-risking our overall portfolio, this included the integration of a monitoring and early warning system for key sectors.</p><p>We have set bold aspirations to build new sustainable revenue lines and achieve solid and sustainable growth. Achieving these targets, requires con- tinuing our fundamental shift in our business model away from traditional loan income to a sustainable fee gener- ating business across retails, corporate and investment banking. Our future banking business model is centered on being a lifestyle partner to our clients and providing innovative solutions that will make NBO future ready</p><p>What about the measures taken to support SMEs? We were the first bank to set-up an independent department to cater</p><p>to their requirements in early 2012 and become the partner of choice to over 17,000 of Omans promising entrepreneurs, providing them with both financial support and guidance. We helped several entrepreneurs develop from micro to medium and large sized enterprises, unlocking their potential through the conducting mentorship seminars and providing them with the Tijarati Banking solution, an exclusive SME only product that is carefully tailored and relationship- driven to give young business leaders the means to pursue their dreams.</p><p>NBO also established its very own Innovation in SME Award, offering RO 10,000 to the next great business idea. In early 2018, our efforts in supporting SMEs was recognized as we received the Best Financial Support award at the third edition of the Riyada Entrepreneurship Awards.</p><p>How was the performance of the banks Islamic banking window during the year? NBO allocated RO13.50mn of capital towards the Islamic banking window: Muzn Islamic Banking. Muzn Islamic Banking enhanced their product and service offerings by launching the new private banking division (Privileged Banking) which provides a variety of customized services and Islamic banking products. With dedicated relationship managers, an exclusive access to over 500 airport lounges, and more than 900 offers provided by various retailers globally, Muzn Islamic Banking was able to win the IFN award for the Best Islamic Bank in the Sultanate in 2017.</p><p>What were the major HR and Omanisation initiatives taken by the Bank? Attracting and developing local talent continues to be a priority for us as we look to support Omans wider socioeconomic objectives and promote national talents. It is key that we become an extension to the development of the country through enriching the talent pool of the Sultanate through training our employees, host open talks led by top thought leaders through the NBO Academy of Excellence, and provide a working environment that is educational and a technologically advanced.</p><p>Critical to our success is the need to foster a high performance and a value- based culture and we demonstrated our commitment by creating an environment in which our employees feel motivated and engaged to reach their full potential. To support this objective, we introduced internal talent management programs which would not only attract talent to the Bank, but also retain them. We heavily invested in providing our employees with skillsets and knowledge to feel empowered. We were also the first Bank launch Ibtikar in 2014, a platform to engage employees to create prototype mobile apps that address business owners problems and test these innovative approaches with customers before they are rolled out nationally. Thus, our staff engagement survey results showed a significant increase in engagement levels across the bank. We were successful in being a desirable working environment which is reflected in our current Omanisation ratio at 92.55 per cent.</p><p>Please share your views on your outlook for 2018? I am optimistic for the year 2018 and we are prepared. We set our five-year growth strategy in place in 2014 which I was part of. We put together a forward looking plan that centered on delivering a superior customer experience with the objective of becoming the Bank of Choice for all our stakeholders. To date, we made good progress on our strategic agenda, and will continue to build on our strong foundation to deliver innovative products and services that meet and exceed our target customers banking needs. NBO core business will remain stable, with increased interest rates, active risk management, unlocking cost efficiency through our investments in the digital sector, as well as building a new diversified fee generating solutions across all of our business lines.</p><p>Our retail banking is growing strong and will even be stronger in 2018. NBOs Sadara Wealth Management Team are providing sound advice and producing strong yields for customers through tailor made investment opportunities, insurance products and brokerage services and we will see more in the coming year. Our 20 years old Al Kanz Scheme, will have the largest number of winners; from 373 customers in 2017 to over 15,000 in 2018, with a total of RO3,251,000 prize money. We are helping customers realize the importance of saving by utilising the right incentives.</p><p>We have worked extensively to achieve our vision; to become the Bank of Choice. We anticipate hurdles ahead but I am confident that we can overcome them. We have a strong leadership team in place anchored by employees who are driven, robust systems and procedures, loyal customers and strong values.

Searle Scholar American Enterprise Institute</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Committee on Senate Joint Economic</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">April 25, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairman Paulsen, Senator Heinrich, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss innovation and economic growth. It is an honor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ECONOMIC GROWTH IS CRITICAL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic growth drives increases in living standards and improves quality of life. A simple examination of the fruits of economic growth over the past two centuries dramatic reductions in child mortality rates and poverty rates, significant increases in leisure time, longer lifespans, access to modern education and medical care demonstrates what growth can do for individuals and societies. It has been discouraging to see some downplay the importance of economic growth in the public square. Imagine if our forefathers had done the same. Public policy is rightly concerned with increasing the rate of economic growth. Indeed, it should be among Congress' top concerns.</p><p>HOW ECONOMIES GROW</p><p>Economic output is a function of economic inputs. The growth rate of output, therefore, is determined by how quickly capital and labor grow, along with technology and the skill and knowledge with which factors of production are employed. Especially over longer time horizons, the most important driver of growth is innovation. And fundamentally, innovation is driven by letting loose the creative power of individuals to invent new and better ways of producing goods and services and, of course, new goods and services themselves.</p><p>FOSTERING INNOVATION</p><p>How can Congress foster innovation? One important way is to improve the skills of workers, helping to enable individuals to innovate. Education reform designed to teach twentyfirst century skills is critical. A stronger emphasis on work-based learning for workers with high school degrees is critical. And, in my view, increasing the number of highly skilled immigrants allowed to live and work in the United States is critical as well. Immigrants start businesses at a higher rate than native-born workers.1 Perhaps more importantly, businesses In science and technology industries are disproportionately likely to be founded by an immigrant.2 Many of the most innovative companies in the United States were founded by immigrants.</p><p>Government has a role to play in supporting the basic research that innovation requires. Two important ways government supports innovation are through funding basic research and producing the economic and social statistics required by businesses, researchers, and policymakers. It is critical that Congress not step back from these responsibilities. Beyond encouraging innovation through increasing skills and supporting basic research, there is a wide variety of actions government can take. Avoiding excessively high tax rates, reducing regulation and other barriers to technological progress, and maintaining a posture of openness to the rest of the world through international trade are just some of the ways public policy can support innovation.</p><p>THREATS TO INNOVATION</p><p>Congress can also foster innovation by helping to create and enforce an appropriate regulatory environment. Likewise, imprudent regulation can stifle innovation, slowing economic growth and the rate of improvement of living standards.</p><p>I have been quite concerned about imprudent regulation recently in the conversation around \"Big Tech.\" It has been common to hear calls from both the political left and right to break up major technology firms using the government's antitrust powers. In my view, such action would be a major policy mistake.</p><p>For the past half century the federal government has followed the best standard that experts have crafted to identify anticompetitive behavior: consumer welfare. More specifically, when deciding whether a firm is hurting competition, the following questions should be asked: Is the company reducing the welfare of consumers by pushing up the prices consumers face, and/or by reducing the quality and variety of products and services consumers enjoy?</p><p>This antitrust standard stands in contrast to a different view, which rests on the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of their size, under the assumption that with size comes undue economic power and a lack of competition.</p><p>I would highlight three primary reasons why latter view is inferior to the consumer welfare standard. First, it is much more vague and harder to define. This vagueness invites regulatory mischief at worst. More than that, though, is the concern that due to its vagueness regulators might be swayed more by the public debate around a particular company than by relatively more objective metrics (keeping in mind that there is always a large subjective element to determinations under any standard).</p><p>Second, the view that is suspicious of size ignores the good things that come from size. Economies of scale allow companies to produce goods and services more efficiently, at a lower cost, than relatively smaller firms. These efficiencies can take many forms, including more specialized management and production techniques.</p><p>Third, focusing on size distracts regulatory attention from consumers. This argument is circular. It is equivalent to asserting that consumer welfare should be the regulatory goal in a normative sense.</p><p>Big Tech has significantly increased consumer welfare. Consider prices. Many products are offered to consumers free of charge. For example, Google searches, Gmail, Google-hosted websites, Facebook accounts, and Twitter accounts are all free. Amazon does not sell its products at a price of zero, but it has significantly reduced the prices faced by consumers for many products. Some even argue that Amazon is reducing the rate of consumer price inflation for the overall economy.3</p><p>Now consider product quality and innovation. The services mentioned above are remarkably innovative. In addition to them, for example, Apple first put an entire music library into the palm of our hands and then put a computer in all our pockets.</p><p>While it is very clear that Big Tech is advancing innovation and consumer welfare today, it is reasonable for regulators to ask whether its actions today might stifle innovation and consumer welfare in the future. In my view, there is little evidence to support this concern. Major technology companies spend significant sums of money on research and development for new products i.e., on fostering innovation. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, spends sixteen percent of revenue on R&amp;D. Facebook spends twenty-one percent. Microsoft spends fourteen percent. These ratios are far higher than for other companies. For example, General Motors, General Electric, Procter and Gamble, and AT&amp;T each spend less than five percent of revenue on R&amp;D.4</p><p>The argument that Big Tech is a threat to innovation and consumer welfare in the future must also contend with the amount of churn in the technology industry. It was not long ago that the dominant web browser was Netscape, not Google; the dominant email service was not Gmail; and America Online was the dominant ISP. It is imprudent to assume that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and other tech giants will be dominant in perpetuity.</p><p>The public conversation also seems to misrepresent the actual dominance of these companies in the present day. For example, despite the concern about Amazon's dominance, online sales represent less than ten percent of total retail sales.5 Walmart's revenue is more than twice that of Amazon's.6</p><p>In summary, I do not view Big Tech as a threat to consumer welfare or innovation, and I am not convinced by arguments that antitrust action is required to advance those goals. Instead, Big Tech is advancing consumer welfare through offering consumers a wide variety of highquality products at low (and sometimes zero) prices. In addition, Big Tech is advancing consumer welfare and innovation in the future through high amounts of spending on research and development, which will fuel innovation for the future.</p><p>And the innovation created by Big Tech will fuel faster economic growth and higher living standards for American families.</p><p>CULTURE</p><p>I will close with brief remarks on the importance of culture. Social attitudes that value hard work and openness to new ways of doing things are critical for fostering innovation, growing the economy, and increasing living standards. The same is true for social capital, which affects trust and cooperation both in and out of economic life. Politics and policy are largely downstream from culture, but it is an overstatement to argue that they don't affect culture. Where innovation comes from is largely a mystery. But a hypothesis worth taking seriously is the intersection of strong institutions and a culture that supports risk taking, skill accumulation, hard work, and creativity. Many public policy decisions in a wide array of domains subtly and indirectly affect these values and dispositions. The total effect of those decisions might be significant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGTST-20189200005914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGTST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S65-8ND1-JDJ1-T2DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Es sind jetzt zudem deutlich mehr Abgeordnete im Parlament, die nicht das Ziel haben, Europa voranzubringen, sondern eher als Bremser agieren werden. Dabei ist klar, dass auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene enorm wichtige Projekte angepackt werden m\u00fcssen, denn die EU hat neben ungel\u00f6sten institutionellen Fragen noch viele weitere offene Baustellen: Die Bankenunion ist lange nicht vollendet, die Kapitalmarktunion in fr\u00fchen Ans\u00e4tzen stecken geblieben, und nach wie vor fehlt die schockabsorbierende Funktion eines europ\u00e4ischen Kapitalmarktes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europa unter Druck</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Auch einen digitalen Binnenmarkt gibt es in Europa l\u00e4ngst noch nicht. Schlimmer noch, so wie bisher wird man keinen digitalen Binnenmarkt bauen und keine grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Produkte in den Markt bringen k\u00f6nnen. Auch deshalb ist zu hoffen, dass es m\u00f6glichst schnell ein arbeitsf\u00e4higes Europ\u00e4isches Parlament gibt. Gerade im Bereich des Zahlungsverkehrs sind die kommenden zwei, drei Jahre unter Wettbewerbsaspekten enorm wichtig.</p><p>Zum ersten Mal in der Nachkriegszeit steht Europa - politisch wie wirtschaftlich - nicht nur aus Ost oder Fernost, sondern auch aus dem Westen unter Druck. Das ist eine Situation, der sich auch die Kreditwirtschaft stellen muss. Deswegen redet sie \u00fcber Europa, deswegen reden die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank und die Bundesbank \u00fcber Europa - auch mit Blick auf den Zahlungsverkehr. Ein Beispiel: Vor einigen Wochen wurde, angesto\u00dfen von den franz\u00f6sischen Kollegen, mit einem neuen Projekt begonnen. Es geht dabei um die Frage, wie und auf welcher technologischen Basis und mit welchen Rahmenbedingungen man in Europa den Zahlungsverkehr grenz\u00fcberschreitend voranbringen kann. Was l\u00e4sst sich tun, um ein eigenes System auf die Beine zu stellen? Unter dem Stichwort \"SEPA for Cards\" gab es schon einmal zarte Anf\u00e4nge, die leider nicht erfolgreich waren. Jetzt aber wird ein neuer Anlauf genommen.</p><p>Ein weiterer Aspekt: Wie kann ein europ\u00e4isches API-Scheme aussehen und was sind die Herausforderungen? Dar\u00fcber wird zurzeit mit vielen Kolleginnen und Kollegen in ganz Europa geredet. Immer wieder sto\u00dfen die Beteiligten dabei auf die gleichen Fragestellungen, denn ein solches neues System muss ja bestimmte Qualit\u00e4tskriterien erf\u00fcllen: Auf welchem Modell baut man auf? Kann man die vorhandenen nationalen Systeme in Europa miteinander vernetzen? An dieser Stelle stellt man als Erstes fest: Es gibt kein einheitliches System. Es gibt auch keine in allen L\u00e4ndern vorhandenen nationalen Systeme; es gibt vielmehr einen Flickenteppich in Europa. Und als Zweites kann man pers\u00f6nlich viel \u00fcber Regulierung im Allgemeinen und Preisregulierung im Speziellen lernen.</p><p>Dass einige L\u00e4nder gar kein eigenes nationales Scheme mehr haben, ist nicht nur einer gemeinsamen L\u00f6sung hinderlich, es hat zugleich auch viel mit Regulierung zu tun - n\u00e4mlich mit der MIF-Verordnung. Einige L\u00e4nder haben ihre nationalen Schemes verkauft, also wird es schwierig mit dem Vernetzen bestehender nationaler Systeme. Die neue Europ\u00e4ische Kommission muss daher sehr genau im Auge haben, ob durch Preissetzung nicht nur Wettbewerb in Gang gebracht, sondern wom\u00f6glich auch funktionierende Infrastruktur zerst\u00f6rt wird. Eine andere Idee setzt eher auf neue Infrastruktur. Dar\u00fcber wird zurzeit diskutiert und nat\u00fcrlich spielt das Thema Instant Payment hier eine entscheidende Rolle.</p><p>Die Girocard als Erfolgsmodell</p><p>Was also sind die Erfolgskriterien f\u00fcr ein solches neues System, f\u00fcr eine neue europ\u00e4ische Infrastruktur? Wie kann das Leistungsversprechen eines europ\u00e4ischen Systems aussehen? Wie gelingt es, die Komplexit\u00e4t m\u00f6glichst gering zu halten? Wie steht es um die Akzeptanz bei den Kunden und beim Handel? Welche Reichweite sollte ein solches System haben? \u00dcber all das wird mit dem Regulierer, mit der Aufsicht, aber auch mit den Kartellbeh\u00f6rden intensiv geredet werden m\u00fcssen. Es gibt also jede Menge komplexe Fragestellungen - die Zeit, aber auch die Arbeit l\u00e4uft. Eins sollte klar sein: Gerade wenn es um Infrastruktur geht, bleibt jede politische Idee eine blo\u00dfe Idee, solange sich dahinter kein vern\u00fcnftiges, tragf\u00e4higes Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell verbirgt. Es wird somit sehr darauf zu achten sein, dass diese neue Idee auch wirklich \u00f6konomisch tragf\u00e4hig ist, sonst wird sie nur eine politische Idee bleiben und keine Ver\u00e4nderungen in der europ\u00e4ischen Infrastruktur mit sich bringen.</p><p>Deutschland hat dabei mit der Girocard einiges zu verlieren. Denn die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft wird kein neues System mit hohen Kosten - etwa f\u00fcr die Infrastruktur - auf die Beine stellen, wenn damit gleichzeitig die Aufgabe eines bestehenden Systems einhergehen w\u00fcrde.</p><p>Nur ein paar Zahlen zur Girocard, die 2018 ein enormes Erfolgsjahr hinter sich gebracht hat: 3,8 Milliarden Transaktionen bedeuten eine Steigerung um 19 Prozent gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr; 187 Milliarden Euro Umsatz mit der Karte entsprechen einem Plus von 15 Prozent. Es sind mittlerweile rund 100 Millionen Karten im Markt und die Digitalisierung schreitet massiv voran, etwa beim Smartphone-Banking. Es gibt verschiedene Modelle, aber aus den j\u00fcngsten Gespr\u00e4chen und Erfahrungen ist absehbar, dass, egal wer denn nun ein Smartphone herstellt, dieses Thema in den kommenden Wochen und Monaten positiv abgeschlossen werden kann. Kurzum, die Digitalisierung im Zahlungsverkehr macht gewaltige Fortschritte.</p><p>Das Innovationsthema Instant Payment wurde zun\u00e4chst etwas skeptisch aufgenommen, aber die ersten Zahlen aus den einzelnen Sektoren der Deutschen Kreditwirtschaft zeigen mittlerweile, dass das Projekt ins Laufen gekommen ist. Es muss sich jetzt am Markt beweisen, es muss sich jetzt zeigen, ob die Kunden es annehmen. Wenn man sich die H\u00f6he der Transaktionen bei Instant Payment anschaut, spricht diese bislang eher daf\u00fcr, dass derzeit vor allem Gesch\u00e4ftskunden Echtzeitzahlungen attraktiv finden. Aber auch bei den normalen Privatkunden wird sich Instant Payment \u00fcber kurz oder lang durchsetzen.</p><p>Ein gemeinsames Zukunftsbild entwickeln</p><p>Dar\u00fcber hinaus experimentiert die Kreditwirtschaft mit vielen weiteren Innovationen, ob das neue Terminals sind oder spannende neue Dinge wie TOPP, also die Zahlung ohne Pin-Pad und nat\u00fcrlich kontaktlos. All das hat die Nutzung der Girocard im vergangenen Jahr noch einmal erheblich verst\u00e4rkt. Und auch die Weiterentwicklung wird angegangen.</p><p>Derzeit besch\u00e4ftigen sich die Gremien der Deutschen Kreditwirtschaft zum Beispiel sehr stark mit dem Thema Biometrie. Das ist nicht nur eine technologische Frage, sondern erfordert auch viele Gespr\u00e4che mit Aufsehern und hat komplexe Datenschutzkomponenten. Hier muss die Branche sich \u00fcberlegen, ob Banken und Sparkassen biometrische Daten ihrer Kunden ins Haus holen und wie sie damit umgehen wollen. Das ist keineswegs trivial. Denn es betrifft nicht nur Technologie und Aufsicht, sondern ist auch eine kulturelle Frage, die jedes Kreditinstitut f\u00fcr sich beantworten muss.</p><p>Durch die Digitalisierung wird ein vermeintlich einfaches Produkt wie die Girocard die n\u00e4chste und auch die \u00fcbern\u00e4chste Generation erfolgreich erreichen. Doch f\u00fcr die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft wird es mit Blick auf die fernere Zukunft nicht ausreichen, genau das zu digitalisieren, was sie ohnehin schon immer tut. Da muss mehr passieren. Und genau deswegen ist das Thema Innovation so richtig und wichtig. In der Deutschen Kreditwirtschaft wird l\u00e4ngst dar\u00fcber geredet, wie denn die Zukunft im Zahlungsverkehrsmarkt in Deutschland aber auch in Europa aussehen kann. In den vergangenen Jahren ist in den einzelnen S\u00e4ulen Verschiedenes gewachsen. Nun muss gepr\u00fcft werden, was sinnvoll ist und in eine gemeinsame Zukunft f\u00fchren kann.</p><p>Bei allem Wettbewerb muss die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft hier eine gemeinsame Position f\u00fcr die Zukunft entwickeln. Dabei sind technische Herausforderungen und Herausforderungen aus den jeweiligen Gesch\u00e4ftsmodellen zu meistern. Vieles hat dabei mit Aufsehern, mit Kartellrecht und mit der technologischen Weiterentwicklung zu tun. Positiv stimmt, dass alle Beteiligten verstanden haben, dass die Konkurrenzsituation mit neuen Wettbewerbern - und das sind nicht in erster Linie die Fintechs - heute eine andere ist als noch vor f\u00fcnf Jahren. Die Branche muss jetzt Gas geben, um dieses gemeinsame Zukunftsbild zu entwickeln und sich daran zu orientieren.</p><p>PSD2: Arbeit mit Hochdruck</p><p>Ein weiteres Thema wird in diesem Herbst sicherlich noch einmal eine gro\u00dfe Aufmerksamkeit erfahren: Stichwort PSD2. Es war zun\u00e4chst hoch problematisch, dass die regulatorischen Vorgaben der EBA den Banken viel zu sp\u00e4t zur Verf\u00fcgung standen, um sie noch rechtzeitig umsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Alle Beteiligten arbeiten mit Hochdruck hieran, um zum Stichtag im September fertig zu werden. Zwar unken schon einige Wettbewerber, dass die Kreditinstitute es nicht rechtzeitig schaffen und die Schnittstelle nicht gut funktionieren wird. Aber in allen drei S\u00e4ulen der Deutschen Kreditwirtschaft sind die Beteiligten in h\u00f6chsten Ma\u00dfe engagiert, um das Projekt gut hinzubekommen.</p><p>Jedem sollte klar sein: Die PSD2 ist eine v\u00f6llig neue Welt. Auch in den Banken und Sparkassen hat es ein bisschen gedauert, bis man etwa realisiert hat, dass auch Kreditinstitute Drittanbieter im Sinne von PSD2 sein und daraus selbst etwas machen k\u00f6nnen. Aber mittlerweile zeichnet sich eine Menge spannender Entwicklungen ab. In jedem Falle ist es erfreulich, dass die \u00c4ra des weitgehend unregulierten Screen Scraping nun beendet wird. Aufseher wie Banken werden zudem sehr genau darauf achten, dass die regulatorischen Vorgaben beachtet werden.</p><p>Im Herbst ist gleichwohl kommunikativ eine schwierige Situation zu erwarten, \u00fcber die sich die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft unter anderem schon mit Verbrauchersch\u00fctzern ausgetauscht hat. Warum? Der eine oder andere hat in diesen Tagen wahrscheinlich Post von seiner Bank oder Sparkasse bekommen. Es sind dabei teilweise Briefe unterwegs, die von Juristen f\u00fcr Juristen geschrieben zu sein scheinen. Es ist schon eine Krux: Die Kreditinstitute m\u00fcssen die Sachverhalte so formulieren, um auf der rechtlich sicheren Seite zu sein. Aber je juristischer die Texte ausfallen, umso gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist die Aufgabe der Kreditwirtschaft, den Menschen zu erkl\u00e4ren, dass und warum sich gerade eine Menge ver\u00e4ndert. Die Kunden m\u00fcssen genau wissen, was sie tun, wenn ihnen Drittanbieter ein tolles Angebot machen. Dazu braucht dieser n\u00e4mlich erst einmal den Zugang zum Konto, und der wird in Zukunft nur \u00fcber eine Zweifaktor-Authentifizierung m\u00f6glich sein. \"Zweifaktor-Authentifizierung\" - allein schon diese Begrifflichkeit, das klingt \u00e4hnlich sch\u00f6n wie der derzeit auch aktuelle \"antizyklische Kapitalpuffer\". Aber das hilft alles nichts, die Banken und Sparkassen m\u00fcssen und sie werden ihren Kunden die Ver\u00e4nderungen aufzeigen und ihnen immer wieder verdeutlichen, selbst auf die Risiken zu achten. Denn der Kunde ist hier in der Verantwortung, der Kunde entscheidet, wem er Zugang zu seinen (Konto-)Daten gew\u00e4hrt.</p><p>Technologie und Wettbewerb im raschen Wandel</p><p>Banken, Sparkassen und Verbrauchersch\u00fctzer haben ein gemeinsames Interesse daran, dass der \u00dcbergang in die PSD2-Welt gut gelingen wird, auch weil er wirklich viele neue Chancen er\u00f6ffnet - f\u00fcr Kunden, f\u00fcr die Wirtschaft, f\u00fcr die Finanzbranche. Doch wie so oft bei regulatorischen Vorhaben - gerade auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene - auch bei der PSD2 kann man immer wieder lernen. Das unterstreicht auch die r\u00fcckblickende Einsch\u00e4tzung eines hohen Beamten des Bundesfinanzministeriums. Sein Tenor: Als die PSD2 vor rund f\u00fcnf Jahren entworfen wurde, war eine der Grundideen, Drittanbieter wie etwa Fintechs gegen\u00fcber den Kreditinstituten ein bisschen nach vorne zu bringen und ihnen die M\u00f6glichkeit zu geben, an Kontodaten zu kommen. Der Idee nach sollten \"den Kleinen\" bessere Wettbewerbsbedingungen erm\u00f6glicht werden. Mittlerweile wollen jetzt aber nicht in erster Linie Fintechs an die Kontodaten, sondern die Interessenten sind bekanntlich alle ein bisschen gr\u00f6\u00dfer und haben zum Teil schon sehr viel Erfahrung mit der Daten\u00f6konomie. Sie werden die Kunden der Banken und Sparkassen sicherlich mit vielen attraktiven, neuen Ideen begeistern wollen. Die Finanzbranche muss ihrerseits erst noch lernen, was sie aus PSD2 machen kann. Da ist noch Luft nach oben.</p><p>Einerseits war es also ein positiver Ansatz, mit Regulierung M\u00e4rkte zu bef\u00f6rdern, aber andererseits zeigt die Entwicklung, wie schnell sich mit der Zeit nicht nur Technologie, sondern auch die Wettbewerbssituationen ver\u00e4ndern und wie schwer - wenn nicht gar unm\u00f6glich - es f\u00fcr den Gesetzgeber und f\u00fcr den Regulierer ist, das alles zu antizipieren. Manchmal sieht die Situation, wenn ein Gesetz in Kraft tritt, schon v\u00f6llig anders aus als zu dem Zeitpunkt, als die Idee beim Gesetzgeber aufgekommen ist. Und das gilt eben auch f\u00fcr das Thema Ver\u00e4nderungen bei der Infrastruktur. Damit kurz zur\u00fcck zum Thema Girocard: Hier muss Deutschland aufpassen, dass man mit einem europ\u00e4ischen System nichts kaputtmacht, bevor man etwas tragf\u00e4higes, wettbewerbsf\u00e4higes Neues hat.</p><p>F\u00fcr einen erfolgreichen \u00dcbergang in die neue PSD2-Welt im Herbst spielen zudem die Themen Sicherheit, Bedrohungspotenzial und Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit eine wichtige Rolle. Denn: Leider wird die \u00dcbergangsphase auch Kriminelle auf den Plan rufen. Also gilt der Appell an die ganze Branche, hellwach zu sein, zu kommunizieren, ihre Kunden zu informieren und sicherzustellen, dass die Schnittstellen dann im Herbst auch entsprechend gut funktionieren. Das gilt nicht nur f\u00fcr die Frage der ber\u00fchmten NFC-Schnittstelle bei Apple, die sich hoffentlich bald kl\u00e4ren wird, sondern das wirft auch Fragen auf, wenn etwa in der K\u00fcche mit digitalen Ger\u00e4ten gesprochen wird. Oder speziell: Was ist eigentlich mit Alexa-Daten, wenn sie eine Bank betreffen? Wieso k\u00f6nnte Alexa wissen, was in der Bank los ist, aber die Bank nicht, was der Kunde mit Alexa veranstaltet?</p><p>Umgang mit Daten</p><p>Das f\u00fchrt wiederum zur\u00fcck zum Thema Daten. Hier treffen zwei (Erfahrungs-) Welten aufeinander: Die Kreditinstitute streben mit ihren Finanzdienstleistungen eine Rendite an. Wenn ein Big-Tech Finanzdienstleistungen anbietet, will es Daten sammeln und auswerten - es ist in der Daten\u00f6konomie zuhause. Das ist ein v\u00f6llig anderer Ansatz, auf den sich die Finanzbranche insgesamt einstellen muss. Auch f\u00fcr die Entwicklungen der Plattform-\u00d6konomie werden Banken sich Fragen stellen m\u00fcssen. Und ihre Antworten werden unterschiedlich ausfallen. Auch hier werden Daten eine entscheidende Rolle spielen, die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit, die Nutzbarkeit von Daten, auch wenn die Branche da noch ganz am Anfang ist.</p><p>In Deutschland ist die Nutzung von Kundendaten ohnehin ein sensibles, ein Kulturthema. Was machen Kreditinstitute eigentlich mit den Kundendaten? Wie weit d\u00fcrfen sie gehen? Wie weit sollen sie gehen? Welche Anspr\u00fcche, welche Erwartungen haben ihre Kunden? Das ist ganz klar eine Generationenfrage, die hat auch viel mit der Kundenstruktur zu tun und f\u00e4llt daher von Bank zu Bank sehr unterschiedlich aus. Manche Kunden, manche Banken erwarten schon viel mehr an Komfort, an \"Convenience\" und manche sagen: Sei blo\u00df vorsichtig! Daher sollte in der Plattform- und Daten-\u00d6konomie jede Bank wissen, welche Rolle Daten in ihrem Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell und bei ihrem Kundensegment spielen, was sie den Kunden bieten kann und was sie ihnen bieten muss. Die Big-Techs sind schon l\u00e4ngst da und werden mehr und mehr pr\u00e4gender Teil des Lebens der Kunden.</p><p>So ist auch das Smartphone mittlerweile aus dem Leben der allermeisten Kunden nicht mehr wegzudenken. Das will die Branche nutzen: Gerade auf diesem Feld gibt es in Deutschland viele gute \u00dcberlegungen - etwa rund um die Girocard. Vieles von dem, was auf dem vorangegangenen Bundesbanksymposium zum Zahlungsverkehr vor zwei Jahren diskutiert wurde, ist heute Wirklichkeit und zeigt, welche Musik heute im Zahlungsverkehr ist. Bei den technologischen Neuerungen ist die hiesige Branche mittendrin und dabei. Sie macht gerne mit beim Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB), Sepa-Proxy-Look-up oder auch beim Thema Zahlungsanforderungen (Request to pay), das sind wunderbare Aufgaben. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr die Frage, wie man Personen-an-Personen-Zahlungen (P2P) grenz\u00fcberschreitend auf Proxy-Basis organisieren kann, also mit Handynummer oder mit einer E-Mail-Adresse. Da wollen und da werden die deutschen Banken auf jeden Fall ganz vorne mit dabei sein.</p><p>Regulierung mit Augenma\u00df</p><p>Eine Binse, doch was digitalisiert werden kann, das wird auch digitalisiert werden. Als Ansporn und Warnung zugleich kann man aus Sicht der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft noch hinzuf\u00fcgen: Wenn es die hiesige Branche nicht macht, machen es die anderen. Und die sind bekanntlich auch sehr gut. An all diesen Themen zu arbeiten, ist herausfordernd, es macht aber auf jeden Fall auch sehr viel Spa\u00df. Vieles wird vorangetrieben, kostet aber auch ziemlich viel Geld, das Banken und Sparkassen erstmal verdienen m\u00fcssen. Gelegentlich darf man deshalb auch den Politikern zurufen, nicht regelm\u00e4\u00dfig am Sonntag profitable Banken anzumahnen und an den anderen Tagen tolle Ideen f\u00fcr eine Regulierung zu produzieren, mit der den Banken wieder viel Geld aus der Tasche gezogen wird. Banken wollen lieber Geld ausgeben, um Innovationen voranzubringen, das macht Spa\u00df, \u00fcbrigens auch jungen Leuten. Diese Themen sind in den Banken nicht langweiliger als in jeder flotten, schicken anderen Branche, in der die Digitalisierung die Welt gerade neu erfindet.</p><p>Der Beitrag basiert auf einer Rede des Autors anl\u00e4sslich des Bundesbank-Symposiums \"Zahlungsverkehr und Wertpapierabwicklung in Deutschland im Jahr 2019\" am 29.

Many have commented that new things - whether products, services or ways of working - that would have taken months or years to implement under normal circumstances, or even regarded as impossible, were realised in days or weeks due to pressing necessity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the rapid restructuring of everyday life, it has become obvious that the resources that banks across the globe have invested in digitally transforming their businesses from top to bottom over the past decade has paid off during the Covid-19 crisis. Impressively, most of the submissions for this year's awards included new products and services aimed at responding to client needs - whether retail customers, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates or institutions - during the global lockdown.</p><p>And while we can't claim to have had a premonition, The Banker team did exhibit some foresight at the beginning of the year when we decided to rename our popular Tech Projects Awards to the Innovation in Digital Banking Awards, which we thought better reflected what was happening across the industry. After years of the digital transformation category receiving the most entries from across the world, we were keen to dig deeper into developments and innovations happening on a regional level - as well as reward regional pioneers.</p><p>What has become clear over the years is that enterprise digital transformation is not a piecemeal endeavour - it is a wholesale and fundamental shift in mindset, as well as technology. And those institutions that are truly innovative and want to stay competitive in the future have been transforming their workforce as well as their tech stack.</p><p>We did, however, retain a few of the most popular project categories, including artificial intelligence/robotics, mobile channel and payments, which always garnered a sizeable volume of submissions in previous years. We also kept the fintech partnership category and added another for technology joint ventures.</p><p>One observable trend is that most submissions, even in specific project categories, have broken down the technology silos and combined many emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and smart contracts, data analytics and open application programming interfaces. Cloud technology is underpinning the exponential explosion in innovation - which is nothing new for fintechs, but it is beginning to permeate all areas of the incumbent banks, which are starting to reap the efficiency and reduced time-tomarket rewards.</p><p>Collaboration is another dominant theme, with most submissions listing both big tech and fintech partners. In-house development is still happening, but many banks are leveraging the power of multiple best-in-class fintech solutions that can be quickly tailored to their needs.</p><p>In addition to renaming our awards, The Banker is hosting an inaugural virtual ceremony (as prescribed by current conditions) to showcase the winners. The webinar will also include a panel discussion with experts on industry trends.

It's a tough job and we appreciate your diligence.</p><p>GLOBAL/EUROPE WINNER: BBVA BBVA, a renowned leader in digital banking, took the 2020 accolade for the most innovative bank in the world and Europe. The success of the Spanish lender's digital transformation strategy is demonstrated in its results, launches and key performance indicators.</p><p>\"BBVA's digital transformation is about enabling people to bank where, when and how they like, but also to ensure that we help them understand their finances and data in a way that adds real value to their lives,\" says David Puente, BBVA's global head of client solutions. \"However, none of this would be possible without incredible teamwork, the use of technology, and the platforms and systems we have been building and which are now allowing us to deliver this goal.\"</p><p>During the review period, BBVA announced a set of priorities intended to continue the transformation process. These priorities are underpinned and powered by digital technology and the strategic, permissioned, and risk-controlled use of data, and include improving clients' financial health and helping their transition towards a sustainable future.</p><p>One of the core digital strategies BBVA has focused on has been continuing to develop its global operating model. Three areas to highlight during the past year have involved the launching and development of global platforms.</p><p>First is the launch of BBVA's global cloud platform, Ether, deployed in August 2019. Ether supports the bank's community of 12,000 developers to deliver end-to-end business solutions faster and work as a global team. It provides them with a common infrastructure, architecture, security and automation stack to help them build either front, back or data components quickly.</p><p>Over the past five years, BBVA's transactional volumes have grown between two and two-and-a-half times across different geographies. Ether has not only been able to absorb this new demand but has also kept costs flat throughout this transformation.</p><p>The platform runs on both in BBVA's private data centres in Spain and Mexico, as well as on public cloud services like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. By rebuilding some of core applications in Ether, the bank has managed to move a number of critical workloads away from the mainframe and into the cloud.</p><p>Ether gives developers new capabilities not found on legacy stacks, including: big data and artificial intelligence compute capacity; providing global architectures to build channels like web, mobile, contact centres and even branches quickly; enabling an end-to-end security model across multiple platforms and countries, as well as new methods like biometry and online on-boarding; and providing an end-to-end automation stack from process orchestration, centralised document management and digital signatures.</p><p>The platform has also helped the bank launch two talent development initiatives in the past year: Tech University, which has reskilled more than 3000 employees, and Ninja Academy, a self-service learning platform where engineers can decide which training will best complement their core skills. Another area where BBVA has led banking transformation in recent years, especially in Europe, has been around open banking and has been providing access to the bank's application programming interfaces (APIs) to third parties since 2017. In the past year, the bank has unified its API offering, enabling global and local partnerships through one global platform - the BBVA API_Market.</p><p>BBVA took the lead among its peers in launching products in a third-party app when it launched a partnership with Uber in July 2019. Uber's partner drivers and their families can open a new BBVA bank account directly through the Uber app and benefit from the Uber Driver Partner credit card, which gives them discounts on fuel and other discounts Uber strikes on their behalf. By using BBVA's Instant Pay API, drivers also receive their earnings within minutes into their bank account. In Europe, BBVA also began offering point of sale (POS) financing for retailers in Spain. By enabling POS devices to connect into the bank through APIs, retailers can instantly offer customers access to up to (EURO)1500 credit - subject to a credit worthiness check - on the spot, with biometrics and twofactor authentication used to confirm the customer's identity. The bank was also able to support Alipay customers in Spain (Alipay), allowing businesses in the country to offer this payment system to Chinese tourists.</p><p>Using biometric technology, in August 2019 BBVA became the first bank in Spain to offer fully digital enrolment to potential customers. From October last year, more than 650,000 companies using the Spanish government-issued digital administrators' certificate were also able to register to become BBVA Spain customers in the same way.</p><p>Through its use of agile delivery and higher level of automation, BBVA reports a 70% reduction in the delivery time for new products. And due to its distributed cloud platform and new testing capabilities, it is now seeing an 80% reduction in errors.</p><p>AFRICA WINNER: STANDARD BANK CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING \"At Standard Bank, we believe that the time is right to re-imagine transaction banking, further catalysed by the current economic crisis,\" says Hasan Khan, head of transactional banking services for Standard Bank Group. \"And we believe that by leveraging digitisation, by leveraging data, by improving our team's experiences, we will help our corporate clients realise their potential.\"</p><p>The South African lender's decision to disrupt itself through its Programme Quantum Leap clinched it the award for the Best Bank in Africa for Innovation in Digital Banking.</p><p>In 2019, a small team was set up in an innovation lab situated separately from the bank's corporate premises. The team members were to base their thinking as a fresh entrant, unencumbered by any existing constraints, embrace advancements in technical architectures and partner with clients to understand their aspirations.</p><p>In order to break free of its legacy technology architecture, the first venture of Prociently gramme Quantum Leap was to design and build a platform using a first-principles approach and re-imagining architecture based on micro-services, cloud, application programming interfaces, and open source, as well as engaging third-party service providers.</p><p>This approach has allowed for a materially faster and lower build cost of client experiences. The team assembled and deployed both the Quantum Leap platform and its first proposition, QuantumTrade, within 14 weeks of the venture inception - a fraction of the time it would have taken for a typical bank within a legacy environment.</p><p>QuantumTrade is an online platform for clients to instruct the bank to issue domestic guarantees and import letters of credit using a process that is digitised from application to issuance. The end-to-end processing time has been reduced from days to an average of just 25 minutes.</p><p>Predictive due diligence checks are completed before application submission, leveraging the bank's understanding of its clients and their supply chains. Additionally, online, real-time status tracker allows clients to see the status of their application. Since its launch, Standard Bank has released incremental features every two weeks, ensuring that client feedback is incorporated into the solution.</p><p>The bank provided several testimonials from its clients, including one from CMC Motors: \"It's been a very good experience throughout, as the bank has partnered with us in creating this. [Standard Bank] has revolutionised how we do things. It has served us well, especially during this Covid-19 lockdown period.\"</p><p>ASIA-PACIFIC WINNER: HSBC HSBC beat out several innovative regional peers to scoop the Innovation in Digital Banking accolade for Asia-Pacific due to its mobile-first digital strategy, single technology platform and global code approach. The bank's overarching vision for digital banking has allowed it to respond quickly to customer needs as a result of Covid-19.</p><p>\"Our vision is simple: we want to put more of the bank in our customers' pockets, blended with the power of our people, so we can support our customers in the best possible way,\" says Charles Allen, global head of mobile and smart channels, and regional head of digital business Asia-Pacific. \"We're confident the work we're doing today with digital will deliver higher customer satisfaction and faster growth at a lower cost to serve.\" In 2019/2020, HSBC embarked on a second phase of its multi-year digital banking strategy. After establishing a strong foundational code base, the bank launched new country-specific mobile apps to optimise and deliver consistency in user experience, catering to size and diversity of its customer base across Asia-Pacific, while effi-delivering local variants to ensure that they meet customers' needs. With a \"single stack, multi-app\" approach, the bank has maximised code reuse, as well as reduced development and delivery time.</p><p>Within Asia, HSBC has launched mobile apps in six markets - Australia, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam - and it enhanced more than 20 major features and delivered these to markets efficiently by reusing global components. These include biometrics log-in with optional PIN entry, digital card activation, instalment payments set up digitally, new product digital onboarding with pre-filled forms, and more.</p><p>Gaining an edge on the big Chinese banks is not easy, but HSBC has become the first foreign bank to enable smart mobile onboarding journey for a main account in mainland China. New retail customers only need to spend 10 minutes to sign up on HSBC China Mobile Banking or WeChat Banking. The bank reports a 30%-50% reduction in in-branch account openings, helping to accelerate the moved to digital platforms under the current Covid-19 situation.</p><p>HSBC has also matured and updated its delivery model to take advantage of its economies of scale. The Philippines and Sri Lanka are the first two markets to go live with Amazon Web Services for customer onboarding/approval journeys. The bank uses Jumio, an AI-powered identity and verification solution, and credit data integration, enabling an instant decision in principle.</p><p>CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE WINNER: SBERBANK Sberbank, which scooped the central and eastern Europe regional honour, is continuing the process of transforming its technology stack and developing innovative solutions that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, machine learning, blockchain, application programming interfaces (APIs) and other technologies. The Russian lender is also investing in the development and popularisation of emerging technologies on a countrywide scale.</p><p>In 2019/20, Sberbank has continued to focus on client experience by expanding its range of banking and non-banking services. It has developed a seamless navigation between services in its digital business ecosystem, Sberbank Ecosystem. Linked by the bank's internally developed 'Fintech API', it has integrated more than 40 partners into the ecosystem, with activities and interests spanning food delivery, taxi services, digital healthcare, neuroscience and much more.</p><p>The bank relaunched the API in mid-2019, incorporated it into its online bank, Sberbank Business Online, and made it available for every corporate client, which can use the technology to deliver a better user experience. A client can apply for the API in the online bank, without having to visit a branch, signing all necessary papers with an e-signature.</p><p>Clients can use test and production areas, such as the sandbox Sberbank deployed with Swagger. With the help of this debugging environment, developers can simulate the business process and get the result without writing the code. After integrating with bank API, the client can view detailed information on the service and usage statistics, such as payment collection methods for subscriptions.</p><p>The bank has also launched personalisation functionality in Sberbank Online, the bank's app for retail customers, to help them find necessary services up to three to five times quicker. The app adapts the interface for each of the bank's 57 million customers using AI algorithms which analyse customer preferences based on 1,000 parameters and suggest widgets with the most relevant actions on top of the main screen of the app.</p><p>For example, if a customer pays their utility bills at the beginning of the month, the relevant widget will pop up at this time.</p><p>In addition, at the beginning of 2020 Sberbank released the Navigator Platform, which is a dashboard, data visualisation and data analysis tool. Developed in-house, the omni-channel platform is based on open-source solutions, best practices and h a s a u s e r -f r i e n d l y i n t e r f a c e. To p management, middle management and analysts can trace analytical data from aggregate level to detailed view of every client, transaction and operation in just a few clicks.</p><p>LATIN AMERICA WINNER: BANCO BRADESCO Banco Bradesco believes that continual innovation in its daily decisions and operations will ensure the bank remains relevant for the financial system, and for society as a whole, by satisfying different customer profiles.</p><p>\"Our goal is to put Bradesco in the position of being the first bank for our clients, offering the best services through physical and digital channels, and providing a simplified, practical and secure journey,\" says Walkiria Schirrmeister Marchetti, executive managing director, Banco Bradesco.</p><p>The Brazilian lender's digital banking strategy is focused on three areas. First, its innovation is tied into making new products, services and technologies which simplify customers' lives available on its digital channels. In 2019, 96% of customers' transactions were through digital channels. Bradesco's innovation hub, Inovabra, fosters collaboration with employees, business functions, clients, companies, start-ups, technology partners, investors and mentors. Inovabra is engaged with 1800 registered start-ups, more than 190 residents' start-ups and 92 large corporates in its physical space called Habitat and has a private equity fund of R$400m ($70m).</p><p>Over the awards review period, the bank improved its multi-platform digital assistant, Bradesco Artificial Intelligence (BIA), by launching voice-based wire transfers between Bradesco accounts using the app, which contributes to a frictionless customer journey. The bank has also rolled out a contextual credit offering, which considers customer requirements during specific life events.</p><p>Second, it is focused on its native digital bank, called 'next', which applies user experience design, intelligent customer journeys and predictive algorithms for a better experience, anticipating user actions and suggesting financial solutions. It is designed as a hub to connect with other digital platforms.</p><p>In 2019, Bradesco expanded next's hub of connections, including a recent deal with a large cosmetics company which has created a new business model that offers a range of benefits to beauty consultants, including access to a free digital bank account and a mobile credit card machine.</p><p>The third area of focus is open banking. While the regulatory framework is still under construction in Brazil, Bradesco sees open banking as an opportunity to establish external partnerships to offer new products and serve new niche markets. Its proposal of \"bank-as-a-service\" creates a hub of connections and new lines of business/segments. The bank has already implemented two initiatives aligned to this model: next, which distributes non-financial products (perks) to customers; and Portal MEI, which provides business solutions for individual micro-entrepreneurs.</p><p>NORTH AMERICA WINNER: SCOTIABANK \"Several years ago, we committed to becoming a leader in digital banking and made significant and focused investments to achieve our objective,\" says Brian Porter, president and chief executive officer, Scotiabank. \"This recognition as the most innovative bank in North America is evidence that our investments and efforts were the right ones for our bank, our customers, our shareholders, and our employees.\"</p><p>Scotiabank pursues a single digital strategy across its five key markets (Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia), which aims to leverage data and analytics to offer the right products at the right time, strengthen the bank financially and provide customers with an unparalleled digital experience. After laying the technology foundation, the bank pivoted in 2019/20 to accelerate its digital transformation.</p><p>This has meant that its design, data analytics, product, and engineering teams could step up during the Covid-19 pandemic, delivering solutions - often across borders - that improved the customer experience, provided relief, generated new revenues, and transformed how the bank operates, which also led to savings as transactions migrated to digital channels. Impressively, online transactions spiked in just weeks, rivalling levels previously seen for entire years.</p><p>The Canadian bank's strategy of having digital factories in each of its core markets proved especially effective. Each hub, which house expertise ranging from user experience design and data analytics to mobile app development and DevOps engineering, rapidly developed regional soluhousehold, tions and then shared and reused design patterns and code across borders. In some weeks, Scotiabank released as many as four new customer solutions.</p><p>For example, to better understand customers' financial vulnerability during Covid-19, Scotiabank's analytics teams built a model to calculate a \"vulnerability score\" for retail customers. Using this metric, the bank built relief programmes to proactively reach out to the most vulnerable customers and provide tailored financial advice. The concept has been implemented across its Canadian and international banking markets, as well as its digital bank, Tangerine Bank.</p><p>Through Scotiabank's retail and Tangerine businesses, the bank has provided financial relief to more than 315,000 customers, on assets worth more than C$48bn ($35bn), with most of these efforts deployed through digital channels. In the Pacific Alliance countries, the bank processed 2.5 million customer assistance programme applications in record time, 80% of them digitally. Additionally, with approximately 50% increase in transactions, digital has reduced branch visits significantly, enabling customers to bank with minimal in-person interactions.</p><p>MIDDLE EAST WINNER: THE COMMERCIAL BANK - QATAR The Commercial Bank - Qatar has become a trailblazer in digital innovation in the region, effectively leveraging its technology teams and leading fintechs.</p><p>To further accelerate its digital transformation, the bank established the Commercial Bank Innovation Services (CBIS), an independent research and development company. With operational, technology and client capabilities all under one roof, CBIS has developed a model that will enable an exponential increase in the volume of digital transactions and generate new offerings.</p><p>Commercial Bank's retail banking business has been revamped, with an emphasis on providing speedy, secure and attractive transaction propositions to customers. These services have taken on added significance in light of the current Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>For example, the bank launched its \"60-second Remittance\" service, which allows customers to transfer funds internationally to more than 30 countries. Using a network of correspondent banks and fintech, the funds are received by beneficiaries from within 60 seconds to one business day. In 2019, the bank processed 1.5 million international funds transfers, compared to 200,000 in 2016.</p><p>In January 2020, Commercial Bank launched CB Pay, a digital wallet based on the bank's 'Tap N' Pay' contactless payment functionality and remote e-commerce payment using Masterpass checkout. CB Pay allows cardholders to pay for items in stores quickly - and securely through tokenisation - using mobile phones. They can also use CB Pay when shopping online and manage their cards using the CBQ Mobile application. Additionally, Commercial Bank launched the CB Fawri programme in October 2019, which made instant discounts available to cardholders at a wide variety of partner merchant outlets.</p><p>More recently, Commercial Bank responded to foreign workers' need to transfer money abroad during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially as exchange houses closed to stop the spread of the virus. Within 72 hours, the bank launched a digital product called CB Household Worker PayCard, which allows employers to create PayCard accounts for domestic workers in a farm or personal office. The employee's monthly salary is then credited to the card and, if desired, remittances can be set up on their behalf using the bank's 60-second Remittance service.</p><p>\"Commercial Bank is committed to digital innovation to enhance the experience of our customers. This award reflects the strength and breadth of our best-in-class digital products and our strategy of investing in innovative technologies. We will continue to introduce new digital innovations that make banking easy, convenient and secure,\" says Joseph Abraham, group CEO at Commercial Bank.</p><p>AI AND ROBOTICS WINNER: CREDIT SUISSE Project name: Margin processing platform In response to several global initiatives that have transformed traditional margin processing, Credit Suisse built a new margin processing platform using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and robotic process automation (RPA). The bank realised that greater automation was the only way to cope with the expected exponential rise in the number of daily margin calls due to new regulations. In addition, the bank wanted to address human processing errors and the requirement for several additional control points to reduce operational risk.</p><p>\"Knowing that the Uncleared Margin Rules would add significant volume and complexity to over-the-counter collateral management, we wanted to implement smart and sustainable automation to give us scale, accuracy and speed,\" says Karen Newton, global head of margin, loan operations and EMEA regional offices at Credit Suisse.</p><p>Using NLP and ML, the platform processes and classifies emails, determining the counterparty intent and extracting key data elements. Then RPA enters the margin call into the collateral management systems, while an exception process handles complex cases. Unlike traditional rule-based technologies, the ML engine continually learns from experiences using a built-in feedback loop.</p><p>As of December 2019, the Swiss bank had fully automated 77% of daily margin processing, and it is expecting a further increase to 90% straight-through processing (STP) through ML and the adoption of neural networks. Impressively, despite a twofold increase in daily margin calls due to market volatility in March 2020, the platform scaled up to meet these volumes over an extended period, without manual intervention or process changes, which allowed Credit Suisse to effectively manage the credit and liquidity risk associated with the market conditions at the time. In addition, it has created capacity within the team to deliver value-added capabilities to both internal and external clients. The agnostic nature of the solution makes it highly portable, well beyond the financial industry. Within Credit Suisse, the underlying technology solution is already being applied to credit repo for the processing of transaction lifecycle events initiated through client email requests.</p><p>As one judge comments: \"This innovation is clearly transformative and provides a portable utility solution that can be used in other parts of the bank. With 77% of STP already reached, their next milestone of 90% looks attainable and the full automation of the process is impressive.\"</p><p>CYBERSECURITY WINNER: BANCO BRADESCO Project: Cyber range -cyber crises integrated management model Partner: IBM Keenly aware of the risks posed in cyberspace to its business, reputation and customers, Banco Bradesco decided to re-enforce its cyber defence strategies, not only in IT and security areas but the whole organisation and stakeholders. The Brazilian lender established a Cyber Resilience Programme (CRP), as a broader emergency and crisis management strategic initiative, which integrated all areas in the organisation. \"The realisation of this initiative is to transform the mentality and continue to make all employees aware that cybersecurity is not a computer problem, but a general issue of the organisation, partners and value chain,\" says Andr\u00e9 Rodrigues Cano, executive vice-president, Banco Bradesco. Launched in 2019, the CRP aims to \"align prevention, detection and response capabilities, to mitigate and move on from cyber-attacks, enforcing the organisation business resilience to maintain its core purpose and integrity, protecting its data, applications and IT infrastructure.\"</p><p>The programme scope entailed: current state analysis; creating the governance and communication strategy; designing the future state model; and testing scenarios in a range of cyber sessions at IBM facilities in Cambridge, MA.</p><p>By the end of the project, five cyberattack scenarios were defined and tested in the IBM X-Force Command Centre, which allowed Bradesco to apply fast improvements on its own cybersecurity crisis management model. It was the first Latin America bank to use IBM's command centre to simulate a real cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, Bradesco was able to adopt the best available practices in the market provided by IBM's consultancy, using the expertise of IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence programme among other frameworks, helped to create an acting reference model and cyber crisis scenarios applicable to Bradesco reality.</p><p>Bradesco is using artificial/cognitive intelligence to map global threats and vulnerabilities, searching the web, deep web and dark web, as well as using business intelligence to better understand market trends related to cyber and the adjust its cyber strategic direction - these efforts have helped to reduce the number of attacks.</p><p>The bank's innovation platform, Inovabra, was used to work with fintechs and start-ups to discover new security solutions, from technical solutions to behavioural ones. The bank is also working together with the Brazilian central bank and industry association Febraban to implement a cybersecurity programme and best practices with other companies and banks.</p><p>\"[CRP] scores high on internal alignment and broader industry collaboration and impact,\" says one judge. \"[The bank] clearly benefited from an improved internal architecture and the plug-ins of fintech solutions.\"</p><p>DATA WINNER: CTBC BANK Project: Fraud risk intelligent management project Partners: SAS Institute, Cherri Tech, Grandsys CTBC Bank has experienced a significant increase in online credit card transaction amounts, effectively riding the wave of growing digital payments due to the thriving e-commerce and government promotions. However, the bank also faced increased fraud risk from card-not-present transactions and evolving fraudster modus operandi.</p><p>The Taiwanese lender has enhanced its fraud risk management to maintain its competitive advantage, launching the Fraud Risk Intelligent Management (FRIM) project in April 2020 after two years in development. Now the bank can automatically verify suspicious transactions in a more efficient and user-friendly way. It has not only streamlined the fraud detection process but also reduced the potential fraud loss.</p><p>FRIM uses internal data, external data and advanced analysis technology to construct a 360-degree view of customer transaction patterns. Thus the bank was able to create tailor-made fraud risk strategies for each customer, which has helped it to improve the accuracy of fraud prevention and reduce transaction friction. It can determine the risk level for each payment and take the appropriate strategy to process it.</p><p>As one judge comments: \"This fraud management solution is clearly a leading approach in this market. I appreciate the way the bank combined the necessity of realtime fraud management with the convenience for its clients.\"</p><p>In developing FRIM, CTBC co-operated with SAS Institute to obtain the customer lifecycle dynamic payment information, to evolve the risk management from a transaction level to a customer-centric level.</p><p>The bank not only collected paymentrelated data but also explored the customer's device information. By co-operating with Cherri Tech, the bank could track each customer's device fingerprint, which is the interaction between the customer and the device. The device fingerprint can be treated as an authentication of a customer's identity.</p><p>CTBC also adopted an acoustic model to calculate the probability distribution of the customer voice and language to determine the vocabulary with the highest relevance. The bank co-operated with Grandsys to implement deep neural networks to recognise the features of a voice to find out the true meaning of the customer's expression.</p><p>\"The FRIM project has not only significantly improved the fraud asset quality for CTBC but it has also streamlined the transaction confirmation process for customers,\" says a spokesperson at the bank. \"CTBC will keep forging ahead to exploit more data sources to develop model-based fraud prediction mechanisms to continuously enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud management.\"</p><p>MOBILE WINNER: T\u00dcRK EKONOMI BANKASI Project: SME banking digital platform Partner: Atolye Istanbul Digitalisation and innovation in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) banking has lagged behind retail banking - until now. T\u00fcrk Ekonomi Bankasi (TEB) won the mobile channel accolade in 2020 for its comprehensive business banking mobile application aimed at micro-businesses, SMEs and corporates, which launched in January 2020.</p><p>\"Our SME digital banking platform, CEPTETEB ISTE, is designed for business customers to facilitate, assist and accelerate their business life,\" says Ali G\u00f6khan Cengiz, assistant general manager, SME banking group, TEB. \"We started with deep research on the need analysis and then involved the customers into the production process to shape the solution together to meet their needs effectively.\"</p><p>The app, which has a dashboard, financial calendar and assets and liabilities pages, allows customers to track their financial status in real time. The dashboard provides consolidated data for all type accounts, foreign exchange/gold/silver accounts, credit cards, funds, cheques and loans, while the financial calendar logs past and future payments.</p><p>The Turkish bank reports that SMEs can save time with more than 200 user features, such as a global search engine to find any item. They can take actions easily, replaying previous payments, accessing most frequent/latest transactions, exporting files, managing receivers/suppliers to transfer funds easily, tracking point of sale (POS) devices with merchant functions like real-time turnover, daily and monthly turnover trends, requesting POS materials, and online customer care services.</p><p>Approximately 90% of available banking transactions can be made through the platform, according to TEB. Customers prefer digital channels for transactions instead of face-to-face meetings with a relationship manager, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The convenience and speed are changing clients' expectations, and now they are requesting more services on the app.</p><p>According to one of the judges: \"The specific focus on business customer needs, the cocreation process and the result of enabling business clients to execute 90% of their banking needs via the app is indeed transformative and reflected in the uptake rates.\"</p><p>Mr G\u00f6khan Cengiz adds: \"Business customers need speed, convenience and insights, as well as broader services than core banking functionality. Our customers benefit from the rich set of functionality by managing their money and businesses on the go, save time with the enhanced user experience and can track their financial status in the real time. We will add new integrated services to deliver additional value and meet more needs of these businesses.\"</p><p>OPEN BANKING WINNER: DBS Project: Open banking APIs on DBS Marketplaces Partners: many DBS's open banking submission got a lot of nods from the judges, with many applauding its \"invisible bank\" concept. \"We developed our marketplaces with a focus on convenience, simplicity and personalisation - to effectively make banking invisible for customers,\" says Tse Koon Shee, country head, DBS Singapore.</p><p>\"This was achieved by leveraging our strong data analytics capabilities and advanced modelling techniques to facilitate hyper-personalisation. Our open application programming interface (API) policy enables seamless connectivity with our partners and platforms, allowing a robust ecosystem to be set up with multiple partners at each stage of the customer journey to ensure scalability and agility.\"</p><p>Since 2017, DBS has launched four marketplaces - travel, property, car and electricity - to seamlessly integrate banking into customers' everyday lives. In the past year, it has extensively expanded its open banking ecosystem across these marketplaces.</p><p>For example, the bank has piloted offering customers exclusive member-only deals when they book with DBS Travel Marketplace from Singapore Airlines to Expedia hotels, facilitated by the bank's own open banking APIs for payments. In December 2019, it created the ability for customers to split their booking payments into instalments via My Preferred Payment Plan (MP3), enabled by open APIs.</p><p>In January 2020, DBS onboarded Sabre, linking to more than 40 other airlines partners. The bank also tailors content, offers and other useful information for the customer's upcoming trip. Model-driven artificial intelligence ensures that customers only receive relevant messages and services. Through DBS Travel Marketplace, travel-related bank product penetration - multiplier account, general insurance, DBS Altitude card - from booking on the platform grew by more than 15%.</p><p>In the property marketplace, DBS enhanced its MyHome planning tool in January 2020, improving user experience, leveraging APIs for logic computation. For example, leveraging partners Urbanzoom and Edgeprop's APIs, the bank is able to provide an estimation of the value of the customer's existing property to furnish their home budget. Customers also benefit from contextual advice at timely milestones in their purchase journey.</p><p>As one judge says: \"The creation of an ecosystem based on different partnerships, operated on the basis of smart data and open APIs is a very interesting model. It clearly puts the customer at the centre and leverages data and API technology to enable a broad open banking proposition - something that the European market should be inspired by.\"</p><p>PAYMENTS WINNER: STANDARD CHARTERED Project name: SCPay Partners: Accenture; AliPay &amp; JD.com; SOLACE Corporation, Hazelcast Microsoft Standard Chartered Bank's innovative spirit came to the fore in the design of SCPay, its global payment platform. The platform provides 24/7, real-time payments that are scalable, reliable and secure. It is built on a modern, open source, cloud-native, microservices-based platform, which is flexible to keep up with the fast-changing landscape to meet the time-to-market demands of clients and regulators.</p><p>\"SCPay was a greenfield development, designed for the cloud, and built on a modern microservice and application programming interface-based architecture. It combines Standard Chartered Bank's functional experience with modern technology in an all-new experience,\" says Dr Michael Gorriz, group chief information officer, Standard Chartered.</p><p>Enhancements to the platform were driven by a prestigious client in Hong Kong, which wanted a highly scalable real-time payments solution that could handle vast transaction volumes with round-the-clock availability. The requirement was to scale SCPay up to handle up to 50 times the transaction speed.</p><p>Working through 220 sprints, with 12 teams, covering 1000 user stories and a series of exhaustive performance testing, the bank found that the SCPay platform could handle enormous transaction volumes up to 14,000 transactions per second or more in future.</p><p>As one awards judge comments: \"This global payments platform is leveraging the latest digital technology advances and has been designed with the client at the centre. A very impressive delivery that can be transformational for Standard Chartered's client base.\"</p><p>The platform is built on a 'blue-green' deployment framework, which provides zero downtime for the client. It offers fully automated straight-through processing of transactions with no manual intervention. It has self-healing bots, which can auto-detect and auto-recover from any exceptions. The bank can also establish priority lanes and highways for processing payments based on the client's profile.</p><p>\"SCPay is our response to the rapidly evolving digital payments ecosystem in line with changing client and regulatory needs,\" says Natarajan Sriram, global head, cash technology, Standard Chartered.</p><p>\"By providing client-centric and innovative solutions at speed, SCPay is set to revolutionise the banking experience for our clients and partners by bringing together speed, scale, availability and convenience to handle the exponential [transaction] volume growth which defines the digital economy.\"</p><p>The payments platform has been rolled out in Hong Kong and Singapore for faster payments and direct debits, with more markets planned for the second half of 2020.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY JOINT VENTURE WINNER: R3 Project: Spunta Banca DLT Partners: 18 Italian banks, ABI Lab, NTT Data, SIA The Spunta Banca DLT is a private permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based solution for the Italian interbank reconciliation process, called \"spunta\", which involves the whole Italian banking sector, Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI), its research and innovation centre ABI Lab, plus technology firms R3, SIA and NTT Data. Its transformation potential secured this project the accolade for most innovative technology joint venture.</p><p>Historically, the task of identifying and addressing inconsistencies with the multiple parties involved in the spunta process has been hampered by a lack of standardisation, the use of piecemeal and fragmented communication methods, and no single version of the truth.</p><p>In March 2020, Spunta Banca DLT went live with 32 Italian banks to implement straight-through processing of interbank reconciliations.</p><p>Underpinned by R3's Corda Enterprise DLT platform, the application improves the governance of the overall spunta process, and moves from lengthy error-prone settlements to real-time management of the reconciliation process.</p><p>Transactions are reconciled daily, not monthly as before. In addition, the banks gain full account visibility via a dashboard. Other benefits included the robust, shared automatic matching enabled by the solution and the communication channel integrated into the application. The solution's smart contract technology also provides banks with automated feedback on their transactions. The results include lower operational risk and faster, more transparent processes, all delivered through a userfriendly interface.</p><p>\"The traditional reconciliation process for interbank transactions in Italy - formerly governed by the 'spunta' process - is notoriously complex. Connecting such a large and diverse group of banks in a live environment to tackle a shared problem is a major milestone for digital transformation in the finance sector, providing a glimpse into a brighter, more efficient and interconnected future for all financial markets,\" says Katerina Koutoulaki, associate director, client engagement at R3.</p><p>Twenty-three more banks, part of the second wave, have also gone successfully into production since the beginning of May 2020. And a third wave is scheduled in October 2020, with more than 150 Italian banks going live, representing the whole Italian banking sector.</p><p>Mario Costantini, CEO and general manager of Neva Finventures, Intesa Sanpaolo, explains Spunta Banca's potential for market transformation: \"We can spread the ecosystem in Italy and use this platform for many different use cases, from syndicated loans to anti-money laundering to know your customer and so on. We will all keep working together to leverage the full potential of this technology.\"</p><p>FINTECH PARTNERSHIP WINNER: NCINO AND SANTANDER UK Project name: Revamping Santander UK's technology systems Partners: Accenture, SpringCM, Docu-Sign, Validis, DueDil, Fractal Labs, Actico, Experian's PowerCurve and Tamr Santander UK's technology upgrade is a great example of what can be done in partnership with fintechs, such as cloud-banking provider nCino. The UK lender's commercial business is now based on a modern stack that can be rapidly configured, tested and launch to end users.</p><p>In 2019, Santander UK embarked on a transformation project to deliver a cuttingedge experience for its small and mediumsized (SME) customers. It worked with nCino and other technology partners to replace 13 legacy systems and over 60 enduser computing systems with a cloud-based solution, overhauling its SME, commercial and corporate banking units. The bank purposely selected technology firms with innovative propositions and roadmaps that match its aspirations, both for meeting customer expectations and facing disruptive threats.</p><p>With the nCino platform, Santander UK has been able to provide its commercial customers with a faster and more transparent onboarding experience, greater efficiencies and a swifter lending decision and fulfilment processes. The transformation project operates under the methodologies of design thinking and agile.</p><p>\"Santander UK's digital transformation has had an incredible impact on its business. With the nCino Bank Operating System, [the bank] has improved portfolio management, streamlined workflows and increased transparency, allowing them to focus on being a great bank for their customers,\" says Pullen Daniel, executive vice-president and managing director, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, nCino.</p><p>Santander UK's project discovery started in early 2019, and it began designing, building and user-testing in May 2019. By late August, the bank had completed the first phase of the implementation, making Santander UK officially live with onboarding workflows on the nCino platform. The bank continued to roll out additional phases with digitised production and execution of loan contracts/collateral documents going live in November 2019. Despite the recent unprec-edented health and economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the bank went live with eight additional integrations and full loan book migration in April 2020.</p><p>The bank wanted to move toward cloud-first solutions, using productised tools and integrations where possible. nCino's Bank Operating System is built on the Salesforce platform, which provides a scalable, flexible and secure solution. The use of nCino and its various integration partners has helped the bank to streamline processes and decrease lead cycle and credit decision times by more than half as a result of increased transparency in onboarding and lending workflows.</p><p/><p>BBVA'S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS ABOUT ENABLING PEOPLE TO BANK WHERE, WHEN AND HOW THEY LIKE, BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR FINANCES David Puente</p><p/><p>WE BELIEVE THAT BY LEVERAGING DIGITISATION, BY IMPROVING OUR TEAM'S EXPERIENCES, WE WILL HELP OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS REALISE THEIR POTENTIAL Hasan Khan</p><p/><p>WE WANT TO PUT MORE OF THE BANK IN OUR CUSTOMERS' POCKETS, BLENDED WITH THE POWER OF OUR PEOPLE Charles Allen</p><p/><p>SBERBANK HAS DEVELOPED A SEAMLESS NAVIGATION BETWEEN SERVICES IN ITS DIGITAL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM, SBERBANK ECOSYSTEM</p><p/><p>OUR GOAL IS TO PUT BRADESCO IN THE POSITION OF BEING THE FIRST BANK FOR OUR CLIENTS Walkiria Schirrmeister Marchetti</p><p/><p>THIS RECOGNITION IS EVIDENCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS AND EFFORTS WERE THE RIGHT ONES FOR OUR BANK, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND OUR EMPLOYEES Brian Porter</p><p/><p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW DIGITAL INNOVATIONS THAT MAKE BANKING EASY, CONVENIENT AND SECURE Joseph Abraham</p><p/><p>WE WANTED TO IMPLEMENT SMART AND SUSTAINABLE AUTOMATION TO GIVE US SCALE, ACCURACY AND SPEED Karen Newton</p><p/><p>THE BANK WAS ABLE TO CREATE TAILOR-MADE FRAUD RISK STRATEGIES FOR EACH CUSTOMER, WHICH HAS HELPED IT TO REDUCE TRANSACTION FRICTION</p><p/><p>CUSTOMERS BENEFIT FROM THE FUNCTIONALITY BY MANAGING THEIR MONEY ON THE GO Ali G\u00f6khan Cengiz</p><p/><p>WE DEVELOPED WITH A FOCUS ON CONVENIENCE, SIMPLICITY AND PERSONALISATION Tse Koon Shee</p><p/><p>WE HAVE IMPROVED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, STREAMLINED WORKFLOWS AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY Pullen Daniel</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Andr\u00e9 Rodrigues Cano, executive vice-president, Banco BradescoMichael Gorriz, group chief information officer, Standard CharteredKaterina Koutoulaki, associate director, client engagement at R3</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-161943264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-JP91-JCBW-N0FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001QLL</classCode><className>FORRESTER RESEARCH INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541910 MARKETING RESEARCH &amp;

This is what lies at the heart of the Texas investigation and imminent antitrust lawsuits against \u201cbig tech\u201d companies, and it is what should concern innovators and entrepreneurs alike.</p><p> A recent commentary by former federal prosecutor Theodore Greenberg called for scuttling e-commerce platforms, including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook, by citing the 1990 court-ordered breakup of Microsoft.</p><p> But the tech landscape has changed so dramatically over the 30 years since the Microsoft decision that suggesting it be used as a guide for taking action is misguided and anachronistic. Innovation has moved so quickly. Unfortunately, rather than craft smart legislation or regulations to ensure consumer choice and rights are protected, our leaders have decided to use their offices to bully technology companies. These are the very same technology platforms that have been vital to preserving small business activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and will be crucial to our economic recovery.</p><p> At a time when we should be empowering retailers, restaurants, service providers and small businesses by ensuring their access to digital tools, Attorney General Ken Paxton is preparing to kick the legs out from under the entire structure.</p><p> Our right-wing attorney general \u2014 who has been very busy during the pandemic protecting firearm sales, doing favors for his wealthy friends and arguing about the use of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election \u2014 believes that tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter have stacked the deck against the free expression of conservative positions to curry favor with left-wing ideologues. In a fundraising email last fall, Paxton said Texans \u201care put at risk\u201d by Google \u201cwhose executives clearly display anti-conservative and anti-Republican bias, subtly controlling what Americans see when they search for information about national political issues.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s accusation is simply untrue. As has been explained countless times, Google is not politically biased and works hard to ensure that all political viewpoints are represented.</p><p> And so, we have the very definition of political opportunism. Paxton can simply attribute his interest in breaking up big technology companies to \u201cprotecting the consumer,\u201d but the real reason is to fire up his political base. In the midst of a pandemic, he has found plenty of room for politics and scoring cheap headlines, instead of doing his job. The attorney general\u2019s approach is out of step with the realities of the 2020 technology landscape, as well as the true needs of the businesses and consumers we\u2019re counting on to help us restart the Texas economy.</p><p>     Gunst is CEO of the Austin Technology Council, the oldest and largest tech industry organization in Central Texas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-6113717</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6087-R071-DXVP-V42T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>1 July 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The panel brought together a global group of business leaders, advisers and researchers, including:</p><p>Professor Frederik Anseel, Associate Dean Research, UNSW Business School; David Gram, innovation thought leader and co-founder of Diplomatic Rebels based in Denmark; Rainbow Cheung, Sustainability Lead at SalesForce Asia Pacific, Singapore; and Gordon Renouf, CEO of Good On You.</p><p>Despite technology being the root of many environmental and social problems, it is also key to addressing environmental degradation, climate change, food scarcity, waste management, and other pressing global challenges, Dr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>For innovation to happen, Prof. Anseel encouraged bridging the gap between academics and the industry to exchange information and perspectives. He envisioned an open platform \u2013 a community environment enabling a fruitful exchange of ideas to tackle current issues.</p><p>David Gram saw \u201cthe biggest challenge with business model innovation as the existing business model itself\u201d.</p><p>\u201cInnovation is required to constantly adapt to change, whether it's caused by disruptions such as climate risk, consumer behaviour, new regulations or a pandemic,\u201d he said.What are the key requirements for digital innovation?</p><p>Mr Gram observed that coming up with ideas is the easy part of the process.</p><p>\u201cThe biggest challenge lies in commercialising the idea \u2013 how to launch and scale an idea that is entirely new without using your existing business model.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is where you need to think in a different way because to work in a different way, you need to structure your organisation in a different way.\u201d</p><p>Mr Gram advised businesses looking to innovate to switch to an ambidextrous organisation and leadership style.</p><p>That could mean working at different levels of innovation: from keeping with the existing model while innovating, to using technology to digitise business processes to adopting completely new models that will transform the business.</p><p>\u201cOnly the fewest companies are able to achieve [the latter] level.

Then, by chance, I walked into one of those ubiquitous Walmart optometry centers and realized I could have had the exam and the glasses for little more than the price of the copay. That speaks volumes about our current health system.</p><p>When a third party \u2014 insurance or government, for instance \u2014 pays for something, the prices escalate. What\u2019s the first thing an auto body shop asks when you take in your car to repair the fender? \u201cIs this an insurance job?\u201d If it is, the price will be higher than if you\u2019re paying for it yourself. I never asked the price of my appendix surgery last year, nor did I care. Blue Cross paid the tab.</p><p> It\u2019s far worse when government is the default payer, given there are no serious controls on costs. There only are two ways to divvy up resources: pricing or rationing. As economist Thomas Sowell explains, \u201cWhat everyone wants adds up to more than there is. Market economies deal with this problem by confronting individuals with the costs of producing what they want, and letting those individuals make their own trade-offs\u2026.\u201d</p><p> Healthcare is tough because everyone needs access to life-saving surgeries and drugs. Unfortunately, our policymakers look at the problem through the wrong lens. Many seek to upend an insurance-based system that works remarkably well (despite the high prices) and replace it with government-run systems that will spend the nation into penury and lead to long waits for common services (rationing).</p><p> Instead of starting from scratch, policymakers ought to fill in the gaps \u2014 meet the needs of those people who are falling through the cracks of the current system. One idea goes back to that example in the first paragraph. No one will ever head to Walmart for a kidney trans</p><p> plant, but retail companies and profit-based clinics certainly can offer high-quality, lower-level services \u2013 and impose market discipline in a sector that sorely needs it.</p><p>Walmart announced last year that it intends to provide clinics that offer low-cost X-rays, lab work, checkups and dentistry, according to a recent CNBC article. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a consumer revolution,\u201d former Apple CEO John Sculley told the news network. \u201cWhy? Because if the Walmart tests are successful, and I suspect they will be, people will be able to go in and get these kinds of health services at a lower cost than if they had health insurance.\u201d</p><p> One of the biggest flaws of Obama Care is that it imposed myriad healthcare mandates, requiring health policies to cover every manner of treatment and service that politicians deemed necessary. For instance, it\u2019s silly for an insurance company to be forced to provide my wife and I, who are in our late 50s, with birth-control coverage.</p><p> In other areas, we choose insurance based on our specific needs. I use insurance to protect against financially catastrophic events, not to cover minor services that I can pay for myself. Other people have different needs and priorities.</p><p> Scully explained that the big tech firms \u201crealize that this is the largest remaining industry that has not been revolutionized by modern technologies that has transformed every other big industry in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s because health care, and health insurance, is dominated by government regulation and subsidy. Private companies can\u2019t revolutionize industries that are encrusted with Byzantine rules \u2014 and where price signals can\u2019t work their magic.</p><p> In particular, occupational licensing rules, which are enforced by entrenched industries that want to keep out the competition, make it difficult to innovate. That\u2019s true especially in healthcare industries. One reason the gig economy has been so successful is these emergent companies have created newfangled ways to circumvent competition-stifling policies that lock inefficient systems into place. Thank goodness for clever work-arounds.</p><p> If you look at prices over time, you\u2019ll find that consumer buying power has improved dramatically in industries that have the fewest government regulations. I remember when my parents bought our first color television in 1973 for $470. I still recall the price because it was such a major purchase, the equivalent of around $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. I recently bought a fancy smart TV for 300 bucks \u2014 and chose among dozens of options.</p><p> When products or services largely are immune to market pressure (because government provides, subsidizes or heavily regulates them), inflation levels are daunting. California public schools never have enough money even though per-pupil spending has soared. That\u2019s true for every public service. College tuition has soared. A day doesn\u2019t go by without some politician complaining about skyrocketing healthcare prices. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a connection?</p><p> Sculley predicts Walmart-style health clinics can lead to a \u201cconsumer revolution.\u201d That\u2019s no doubt true \u2014 provided government gets out of the way and allows it to happen.</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California Newspaper Group editorial board.

Then, by chance, I walked into one of those ubiquitous Walmart optometry centers and realized I could have had the exam and the glasses for little more than the price of the copay. That speaks volumes about our current health system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When a third party \u2014 insurance or government, for instance \u2014 pays for something, the prices escalate. What\u2019s the first thing an auto body shop asks when you take in your car to repair the fender? \u201cIs this an insurance job?\u201d If it is, the price will be higher than if you\u2019re paying for it yourself. I never asked the price of my appendix surgery last year, nor did I care. Blue Cross paid the tab.</p><p> It\u2019s far worse when government is the default payer, given there are no serious controls on costs. There only are two ways to divvy up resources: pricing or rationing. As economist Thomas Sowell explains, \u201cWhat everyone wants adds up to more than there is. Market economies deal with this problem by confronting individuals with the costs of producing what they want, and letting those individuals make their own trade-offs\u2026.\u201d</p><p> Healthcare is tough because everyone needs access to life-saving surgeries and drugs. Unfortunately, our policymakers look at the problem through the wrong lens. Many seek to upend an insurance-based system that works remarkably well (despite the high prices) and replace it with government-run systems that will spend the nation into penury and lead to long waits for common services (rationing).</p><p> Instead of starting from scratch, policymakers ought to fill in the gaps \u2014 meet the needs of those people who are falling through the cracks of the current system. One idea goes back to that example in the first paragraph. No one will ever head to Walmart for a kidney trans</p><p> plant, but retail companies and profit-based clinics certainly can offer high-quality, lower-level services \u2013 and impose market discipline in a sector that sorely needs it.</p><p>Walmart announced last year that it intends to provide clinics that offer low-cost X-rays, lab work, checkups and dentistry, according to a recent CNBC article. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a consumer revolution,\u201d former Apple CEO John Sculley told the news network. \u201cWhy? Because if the Walmart tests are successful, and I suspect they will be, people will be able to go in and get these kinds of health services at a lower cost than if they had health insurance.\u201d</p><p> One of the biggest flaws of Obama Care is that it imposed myriad healthcare mandates, requiring health policies to cover every manner of treatment and service that politicians deemed necessary. For instance, it\u2019s silly for an insurance company to be forced to provide my wife and I, who are in our late 50s, with birth-control coverage.</p><p> In other areas, we choose insurance based on our specific needs. I use insurance to protect against financially catastrophic events, not to cover minor services that I can pay for myself. Other people have different needs and priorities.</p><p> Scully explained that the big tech firms \u201crealize that this is the largest remaining industry that has not been revolutionized by modern technologies that has transformed every other big industry in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s because health care, and health insurance, is dominated by government regulation and subsidy. Private companies can\u2019t revolutionize industries that are encrusted with Byzantine rules \u2014 and where price signals can\u2019t work their magic.</p><p> In particular, occupational licensing rules, which are enforced by entrenched industries that want to keep out the competition, make it difficult to innovate. That\u2019s true especially in healthcare industries. One reason the gig economy has been so successful is these emergent companies have created newfangled ways to circumvent competition-stifling policies that lock inefficient systems into place. Thank goodness for clever work-arounds.</p><p> If you look at prices over time, you\u2019ll find that consumer buying power has improved dramatically in industries that have the fewest government regulations. I remember when my parents bought our first color television in 1973 for $470. I still recall the price because it was such a major purchase, the equivalent of around $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. I recently bought a fancy smart TV for 300 bucks \u2014 and chose among dozens of options.</p><p> When products or services largely are immune to market pressure (because government provides, subsidizes or heavily regulates them), inflation levels are daunting. California public schools never have enough money even though per-pupil spending has soared. That\u2019s true for every public service. College tuition has soared. A day doesn\u2019t go by without some politician complaining about skyrocketing healthcare prices. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a connection?</p><p> Sculley predicts Walmart-style health clinics can lead to a \u201cconsumer revolution.\u201d That\u2019s no doubt true \u2014 provided government gets out of the way and allows it to happen.</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California Newspaper Group editorial board.

Then, by chance, I walked into one of those ubiquitous Walmart optometry centers and realized I could have had the exam and the glasses for little more than the price of the copay. That speaks volumes about our current health system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When a third party \u2014 insurance or government, for instance \u2014 pays for something, the prices escalate. What\u2019s the first thing an auto body shop asks when you take in your car to repair the fender? \u201cIs this an insurance job?\u201d If it is, the price will be higher than if you\u2019re paying for it yourself. I never asked the price of my appendix surgery last year, nor did I care. Blue Cross paid the tab.</p><p> It\u2019s far worse when government is the default payer, given there are no serious controls on costs. There only are two ways to divvy up resources: pricing or rationing. As economist Thomas Sowell explains, \u201cWhat everyone wants adds up to more than there is. Market economies deal with this problem by confronting individuals with the costs of producing what they want, and letting those individuals make their own trade-offs\u2026.\u201d</p><p> Healthcare is tough because everyone needs access to life-saving surgeries and drugs. Unfortunately, our policymakers look at the problem through the wrong lens. Many seek to upend an insurance-based system that works remarkably well (despite the high prices) and replace it with government-run systems that will spend the nation into penury and lead to long waits for common services (rationing).</p><p> Instead of starting from scratch, policymakers ought to fill in the gaps \u2014 meet the needs of those people who are falling through the cracks of the current system. One idea goes back to that example in the first paragraph. No one will ever head to Walmart for a kidney trans</p><p> plant, but retail companies and profit-based clinics certainly can offer high-quality, lower-level services \u2013 and impose market discipline in a sector that sorely needs it.</p><p>Walmart announced last year that it intends to provide clinics that offer low-cost X-rays, lab work, checkups and dentistry, according to a recent CNBC article. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a consumer revolution,\u201d former Apple CEO John Sculley told the news network. \u201cWhy? Because if the Walmart tests are successful, and I suspect they will be, people will be able to go in and get these kinds of health services at a lower cost than if they had health insurance.\u201d</p><p> One of the biggest flaws of Obama Care is that it imposed myriad healthcare mandates, requiring health policies to cover every manner of treatment and service that politicians deemed necessary. For instance, it\u2019s silly for an insurance company to be forced to provide my wife and I, who are in our late 50s, with birth-control coverage.</p><p> In other areas, we choose insurance based on our specific needs. I use insurance to protect against financially catastrophic events, not to cover minor services that I can pay for myself. Other people have different needs and priorities.</p><p> Scully explained that the big tech firms \u201crealize that this is the largest remaining industry that has not been revolutionized by modern technologies that has transformed every other big industry in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s because health care, and health insurance, is dominated by government regulation and subsidy. Private companies can\u2019t revolutionize industries that are encrusted with Byzantine rules \u2014 and where price signals can\u2019t work their magic.</p><p> In particular, occupational licensing rules, which are enforced by entrenched industries that want to keep out the competition, make it difficult to innovate. That\u2019s true especially in healthcare industries. One reason the gig economy has been so successful is these emergent companies have created newfangled ways to circumvent competition-stifling policies that lock inefficient systems into place. Thank goodness for clever work-arounds.</p><p> If you look at prices over time, you\u2019ll find that consumer buying power has improved dramatically in industries that have the fewest government regulations. I remember when my parents bought our first color television in 1973 for $470. I still recall the price because it was such a major purchase, the equivalent of around $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. I recently bought a fancy smart TV for 300 bucks \u2014 and chose among dozens of options.</p><p> When products or services largely are immune to market pressure (because government provides, subsidizes or heavily regulates them), inflation levels are daunting. California public schools never have enough money even though per-pupil spending has soared. That\u2019s true for every public service. College tuition has soared. A day doesn\u2019t go by without some politician complaining about skyrocketing healthcare prices. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a connection?</p><p> Sculley predicts Walmart-style health clinics can lead to a \u201cconsumer revolution.\u201d That\u2019s no doubt true \u2014 provided government gets out of the way and allows it to happen.</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California Newspaper Group editorial board.

Then, by chance, I walked into one of those ubiquitous Walmart optometry centers and realized I could have had the exam and the glasses for little more than the price of the copay. That speaks volumes about our current health system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When a third party \u2014 insurance or government, for instance \u2014 pays for something, the prices escalate. What\u2019s the first thing an auto body shop asks when you take in your car to repair the fender? \u201cIs this an insurance job?\u201d If it is, the price will be higher than if you\u2019re paying for it yourself. I never asked the price of my appendix surgery last year, nor did I care. Blue Cross paid the tab.</p><p> It\u2019s far worse when government is the default payer, given there are no serious controls on costs. There only are two ways to divvy up resources: pricing or rationing. As economist Thomas Sowell explains, \u201cWhat everyone wants adds up to more than there is. Market economies deal with this problem by confronting individuals with the costs of producing what they want, and letting those individuals make their own trade-offs\u2026.\u201d</p><p> Healthcare is tough because everyone needs access to life-saving surgeries and drugs. Unfortunately, our policymakers look at the problem through the wrong lens. Many seek to upend an insurance-based system that works remarkably well (despite the high prices) and replace it with government-run systems that will spend the nation into penury and lead to long waits for common services (rationing).</p><p> Instead of starting from scratch, policymakers ought to fill in the gaps \u2014 meet the needs of those people who are falling through the cracks of the current system. One idea goes back to that example in the first paragraph. No one will ever head to Walmart for a kidney trans</p><p> plant, but retail companies and profit-based clinics certainly can offer high-quality, lower-level services \u2013 and impose market discipline in a sector that sorely needs it.</p><p>Walmart announced last year that it intends to provide clinics that offer low-cost X-rays, lab work, checkups and dentistry, according to a recent CNBC article. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a consumer revolution,\u201d former Apple CEO John Sculley told the news network. \u201cWhy? Because if the Walmart tests are successful, and I suspect they will be, people will be able to go in and get these kinds of health services at a lower cost than if they had health insurance.\u201d</p><p> One of the biggest flaws of Obama Care is that it imposed myriad healthcare mandates, requiring health policies to cover every manner of treatment and service that politicians deemed necessary. For instance, it\u2019s silly for an insurance company to be forced to provide my wife and I, who are in our late 50s, with birth-control coverage.</p><p> In other areas, we choose insurance based on our specific needs. I use insurance to protect against financially catastrophic events, not to cover minor services that I can pay for myself. Other people have different needs and priorities.</p><p> Scully explained that the big tech firms \u201crealize that this is the largest remaining industry that has not been revolutionized by modern technologies that has transformed every other big industry in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s because health care, and health insurance, is dominated by government regulation and subsidy. Private companies can\u2019t revolutionize industries that are encrusted with Byzantine rules \u2014 and where price signals can\u2019t work their magic.</p><p> In particular, occupational licensing rules, which are enforced by entrenched industries that want to keep out the competition, make it difficult to innovate. That\u2019s true especially in healthcare industries. One reason the gig economy has been so successful is these emergent companies have created newfangled ways to circumvent competition-stifling policies that lock inefficient systems into place. Thank goodness for clever work-arounds.</p><p> If you look at prices over time, you\u2019ll find that consumer buying power has improved dramatically in industries that have the fewest government regulations. I remember when my parents bought our first color television in 1973 for $470. I still recall the price because it was such a major purchase, the equivalent of around $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. I recently bought a fancy smart TV for 300 bucks \u2014 and chose among dozens of options.</p><p> When products or services largely are immune to market pressure (because government provides, subsidizes or heavily regulates them), inflation levels are daunting. California public schools never have enough money even though per-pupil spending has soared. That\u2019s true for every public service. College tuition has soared. A day doesn\u2019t go by without some politician complaining about skyrocketing healthcare prices. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a connection?</p><p> Sculley predicts Walmart-style health clinics can lead to a \u201cconsumer revolution.\u201d That\u2019s no doubt true \u2014 provided government gets out of the way and allows it to happen.</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California Newspaper Group editorial board.

There's Vancouver-based Stemcell Technologies Inc. - a biotech firm that develops cell cultures and cell isolation systems for researchers - which ships its products to more than 70 countries and has been growing by at least 20 per cent annually since its launch in 1993.</p><p>Or Toronto-based Newtopia Inc., the fourth health-tech startup launched by chief executive Jeff Ruby. Multiple Fortune 100 companies in the U.S. now use the company's software to promote employee weight loss and substantially reduce employer-paid health plan costs.</p><p>With an abundance of clinical talent, hospital support and a current government keen to keep investing in innovation, it seems Canada is creating the perfect ecosystem for continued health-tech growth. The question plaguing many industry leaders, however, is whether the country has the infrastructure and skillset needed to sustain this branch of innovation.</p><p>The medical devices industry alone was valued at US$6.2 billion in 2015 and is projected to grow to $8.6 billion by 2020, according to Emergo, a regulatory consulting firm that specializes in global medical device compliance.</p><p>On the surface, Toronto, in particular, provides the ideal launching pad for health-tech innovation because it has a highly educated and skilled workforce collaborating within a network of world-class hospitals willing to test technologies in real-world practice, said Cameron Piron, chief executive of Toronto-based Synaptive Medical Inc.</p><p>\"The talent here is unique and highly diverse and when you're tackling problems (in health care) you need the best and the brightest,\" he said.</p><p>The city's talent base has enabled Synaptive's founders to launch several Canadian-based medical startups over the past 10 years, the latest of which develops robotics to provide better ergonomics and visibility for surgeons while operating.</p><p>Avrobio co-founder Christopher Paige, a senior scientist at UHN, said the research hospitals and their strong association with top universities across the country create ideal synergies for innovation.</p><p>\"The research hospitals put researchers and top clinicians together in an environment where unmet clinical needs of our patients are pretty obvious - a highly motivating environment to make a difference,\" he said.</p><p>But industry veterans say this isn't enough to sustain the growth of health-care technologies over the long term.</p><p>They point out that even though Toronto is among the top biotech hubs in North America (along with Boston and San Francisco), it has nowhere near the commercial recognition of those two U.S. cities.</p><p>\"Collectively as an industry we've started to do some of the biggest deals in the world here, but we don't publicize these wins as much as we could,\" Taylor said. \"Our science is top notch, but it's underrepresented from a commercialization perspective.\"</p><p>Organizations such as UHN are helping to change that, he said, but there's still a long way to go.</p><p>As well as the lack of local recognition, Taylor said there is a lack of local talent who have the necessary management skills to bring innovative startups into the big leagues.</p><p>\"We never saw the lack of C-suite as a potential problem, but now, generally speaking, people who are coming in to lead these companies are Americans or Canadians who left decades ago and are coming back,\" he said.</p><p>An even bigger issue may be the lack of overall understanding that the rules of typical tech innovation - that is, develop a product and rush it to market before the competition - don't necessarily apply to health tech.</p><p>\"As we see talent moving into this space from the tech market, they are shocked by the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes,\" Synaptive's Piron said.</p><p>Piron said the industry is more like aviation or automotive, where products are thoroughly tested before launch and governed by myriad regulations.</p><p>\"This is a very serious industry that leverages technology, but needs a solid infrastructure behind it,\" he said.</p><p>Case in point, Synaptive in November voluntarily recalled its neurosurgical guidance system due to a software defect that could raise the risk of brain damage during surgery. Fortunately, the recall happened before any patients were impacted.</p><p>Adding to the challenges that health-tech startups face are patient privacy issues that don't apply to other sectors to the same degree.</p><p>\"Starting a health-tech company comes with a firm appreciation of health first, including adhering to privacy laws and regulations and being radically transparent throughout the process,\" Newtopia's Ruby said. \"The 'move fast and break things' approach just doesn't work in health tech.\"</p><p>A lack of long-term capital investment is yet another key issue.</p><p>\"There's a lot of support for startups, but a lot less for those of us who have proven ourselves,\" said Stemcell's chief executive Allen Eaves, who adds that just four per cent of his company's sales are in Canada.</p><p>\"We need health care to be profitable, yet we keep focusing on cost containment in provincial (health-care) budgets - if everyone works hard to save money, then we need to get engaged in the application of new innovations.\"</p><p>The four-year-old Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI) wants to clear the often rocky path from startup to scale that currently plagues some of the most innovative tech firms.</p><p>Made up of more than 100 CEOs from the fastest-growing technology startups (18 of whom, including Eaves, come from health-tech companies), CCI is working with governments to ensure its members have a seat at the table when it comes to decisions around strategic standards, regulations and certifications.</p><p>\"There are a lot of regulatory pain points in how health-tech companies get their products to market here compared to other jurisdictions,\" said Dana O'Born, CCI's director of strategic initiatives. \"Our health-tech companies are keen to work with government to work out these kinks and all our members want to play a role in the development of policy.\"</p><p>But even with all the growing pains, industry leaders say they are optimistic that things are improving every year, especially given the desire for better technologies while cutting costs.</p><p>\"Long ago, the public sector thought they had to be the owner of innovation, but now they see the value in renting it from sectors like ours,\" said Patrice Gilbert, chief executive of PetalMD, a Quebec City-based company that digitizes hospital schedules for 48,000 users across 150 health-care facilities. \"The private and public sectors are getting better and better at finding common ground.\"</p><p>Inherent in moving the dial forward in health care has to be an overall change in mentality around what health care in Canada should be, Newtopia's Ruby said.</p><p>\"We want to keep people healthier longer rather than perpetuating the sick-care system we currently have,\" he said. \"That should be our ultimate goal.\"</p><p>Ruby, too, expects health-care costs to be increasingly offloaded to employers and insurers, because \"there is no way\" Canada's current system will be able to sustain itself for much longer.</p><p>Since 2014, health spending per capita has increased by an average of 1.7 per cent annually to an estimated total of $253.5 billion in 2018, with no signs of slowing.</p><p>\"As that happens, there will be more and more economic motivation to invest in companies like ours,\" he said, \"I absolutely see the tide changing in the years to come.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

As we look to evolve our health care system, however, putting this data into patients' own hands, rather than locking it away in government-run repositories, is essential to improving outcomes and efficiency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The power of such a patient-centric approach is already being demonstrated by early adopters. Kaiser Permanente, a managed care group in the United States, has found that patients who receive medical results prior to appointments with their doctors are more than three times more likely to feel calm and satisfied than confused or worried. In Nova Scotia, 98 per cent of the 6,000 patients who participated in a pilot for MyHealthNS, a secure online tool for accessing health records, said they wanted to continue getting results online; 85 per cent said it made a positive difference in their health management. Physicians also said patients using MyHealthNS were better informed and more frequently came to them with educated questions to make the most of their appointments.</p><p>The race to future-proof the economy: Navdeep Bains on the state of innovation in Canada( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/navdeep-bains-interview-innovation\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/navdeep-bains-interview-innovation</url> )</p><p>Innovation Nation: Big tech lifts all boats( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/innovation-nation-big-tech-lifts-all-boats\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/innovation-nation-big-tech-lifts-all-boats</url> )</p><p>A robot in every factory: The $230-million bid to help automate Ontario's manufacturing sector( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/a-robot-in-every-factory-the-230-million-bid-to-help-automate-ontarios-manufacturing-sector\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/a-robot-in-every-factory-the-230-million-bid-to-help-automate-ontarios-manufacturing-sector</url> )</p><p>As evidence mounts, many Canadian hospitals and health care providers are developing information portals to help patients access details like test results from the comfort of home. These portals are a good start, but they are often limited by implementation only at the hospital or clinic level. A patient who receives care at three facilities might require three separate logins and has to switch between different portals to get a full picture of their health. The strict regulations on who can access electronic medical records (EMRs) also means that not all of these portals are connected to a patient's central heath file. Notes from a physiotherapist may never be seen by a patient's primary care provider and vice versa, potentially leading to contradictory or counterproductive advice or wasteful, duplicate tests.</p><p>The solution is not to give every health care provider unhindered access to EMRs. Where this has been attempted, it has resulted in convoluted vetting processes, which have deterred most physicians from signing up at all. Instead, patients should be able to control who can access their health data using secure cloud-based tools.</p><p>This is where innovative technology startups excel. As impartial third parties, they can create software that functions across specialties, facilities and borders in a way that helps both patients and health providers. Historically, regulations have stood in the way of access to government-run health data repositories. Private EMR vendors have also created obstacles. But in recent years, progress has occurred at an accelerating pace. Dot Health( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dothealth.ca/free?gclid=Cj0KCQiA14TjBRD_ARIsAOCmO9a1f6TKrDHB58v_oHAUFZK4zRwwYcCU7XUI8Fc7xiskFtO2yCjY9zcaAlFVEALw_wcB\">https://www.dothealth.ca/free?gclid=Cj0KCQiA14TjBRD_ARIsAOCmO9a1f6TKrDHB58v_oHAUFZK4zRwwYcCU7XUI8Fc7xiskFtO2yCjY9zcaAlFVEALw_wcB</url> ), for example, a real-time platform for personal health records is opening up our complex web of government and hospital health repositories to retrieve, encrypt and store health information in a readily accessible and shareable format.</p><p>\"The future of health care is global, continuous, and longitudinal. The only way we make this sustainable is by letting individuals access and control their own health information,\" says Huda Idrees, founder and CEO of Dot Health.</p><p>Beyond the benefits for patients, tech innovators have the potential to also make Canada's EMR systems more effective for doctors and other health care providers by better organizing existing information. When services like eHealth Ontario began, their mandate was to consolidate existing medical records to ensure patient data was accessible to physicians across all medical facilities. While they have had limited success, cumbersome validation processes and poorly organized interfaces have made it cripplingly difficult for physicians to gain access to and find critical and relevant information amidst a sea of outdated records. As innovators like Dot Health interface with a growing number of existing EMRs, not only are they helping patients gain access to their own data, they are building solutions that enable health care providers to access the right information at the right time.</p><p>With so many potential benefits, it's not surprising that other countries have moved full steam ahead toward a model of open and shared medical records. Sweden and Finland already allow patients full access to their medical records, and several other countries have implemented systems to allow patients more comprehensive access to test results.

Apple Inc. is acting as if they're the same. It's no secret that Apple is working on self-driving vehicle technology; it is among dozens of companies that have California permits to test autonomous cars on public roads. </p><p>CEO Tim Cook, in his way, acknowledged the driverless transportation project in a 2017 Bloomberg Television interview, and the company last week confirmed earlier reports that it had acquired autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai. And yet Apple remains far more closed than its peers. Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo, Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Inc., General Motors Co.'s Cruise and other companies working on this technology talk fairly openly about their broad ambitions for autonomous transportation, milestones in progress and issues for the industry. Apple does none of this. It's always Apple's tendency to keep mum about a product in development until it's perfect and ready for a world debut. But driverless cars are not smartphones or augmented reality glasses. Emerging technologies, particularly those that have the potential to save human life and also to take lives, need an open debate and deserve a relatively transparent process - warts and all. Driverless cars have the potential to transform the nature of cities, upend a country's workforce, impact the environment and necessitate revisions to laws and ethics. The public is not well served by Apple's inclination against engaging on a subject of such importance. Apple may not be well served by its approach, either. The driverless car industry as a whole has not been an open book. Advocates, and some regulators, have pushed companies to disclose far more than they do about safety metrics and to collaborate with rivals to ensure better and safer progress on autonomous technology. But Apple is taking the industry's discretion to the absurd. Cook reiterated to stock analysts that Apple is interested in autonomous technology and has \"a large project going and (is) making a big investment in this.\" And that's about it. \"I don't want to go any further with that,\" Cook said. He's been similarly vague since then. By comparison, Waymo executives regularly talk about the implications of driverless car technology and its potential drawbacks. In Alphabet's most recent earnings call, executives talked about opening a Michigan facility with dedicated autonomous vehicle production, explained Waymo's focus on Uber-like ride services and mentioned making its in-house vehicle sensors available to outside companies. Last week, an Alphabet executive answered a shareholder's question about how autonomous vehicles might affect tax revenue. For Apple investors, driverless technology is a \"free optionality\" for long-term stock owners, CFRA Research said this week. The costs are already being absorbed. Apple's operating margin is at its lowest level in a decade as a share of revenue. Largely that's because spending on research and development - which presumably includes Apple's driverless car project - amounted to 6 percent of Apple's revenue in the last 12 months. It was 3 percent just five years ago. It's possible Apple is keeping mum about driverless technology because openness is not in the company's DNA. Or maybe Apple's laggard status in the technology explains its silence. California regulatory reports show that Apple's autonomous test cars require more intervention by human backup drivers than many other companies' prototypes. (There is debate about whether this data is the best measure of progress, but it's one of the few available publicly.) Apple has the power to shape public perception in a way that maybe no other company can. It uses that power to sell smartphones, of course, but also to win people over to the company's views of U.S. immigration policy, the importance of teaching software coding to children and the pernicious effects of social media. Driverless cars won't be ubiquitous on public roads for many years, but policies and public perception are being set now. People in the U.S. are skeptical about driverless cars, and if nothing else, a little more engagement from Apple might help change opinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68493854</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG7-C891-JC8S-D44S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Instead, she sent a short video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Andrews is the first industry minister not to attend in person the AFR Innovation Summit, which has been running for three years and become the critical event for assessing the state of play in innovation.</p><p>Her absence does not augur well for implementing policies essential for transforming an economy heavily reliant on commodities exports. Nor does it inspire confidence in the government's ability to lay out a vision for responding to disruptive global technology forces that threaten to change entire industries.</p><p>Chanticleer's assessment of day one of the Summit is split into four categories: digital platforms, innovation funding, government infrastructure and defining success.</p><p>Digital platforms</p><p>Just days after the competition regulator won government support to rein in the power and reach of Google and Facebook leading business figures urged entrepreneurs and established companies to emulate their success.</p><p>Andrew Stevens, the chairman of the government's key advisory body on innovation, research and science, says Australia needs more companies like Atlassian and CSL, which have built global platform businesses.</p><p>\"It seems to me that over the last 10 years the real growth in wealth, employment, revenue and margin have all been in platform businesses,\" Stevens said on the sidelines of the Summit.</p><p>\"Most of the panel discussions today have talked about how do we contain them. Have they got too much power?</p><p>\"Instead, we should be asking, how do we emulate them?\"</p><p>Stevens was speaking a few hours after representatives from Google and Facebook used the Summit to push back against the hard-hitting commentary about their possible abuse of power by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p><p>Melanie Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said big was not bad. In fact, she said there were benefits to consumers from having global platforms with a diversity of interests.</p><p>For example, Google's privacy settings for its search engine are the same for its video streaming channel, YouTube.</p><p>Silva repeated the worn-old argument that Google is not that powerful. She said a lot less than 10 per cent of search queries make money for Google through the serving of ads. But she did give guarded support to some form of regulation.</p><p>\"Smart regulation that's targeted to solve a specific problem that's been identified is always something that we're supportive of,\" she said.</p><p>Jason Juma-Ross, director of technology strategy, Facebook Australia and New Zealand, warned Australia to be careful about imposing regulations out of step with the rest of the world.</p><p>\"We feel that regulation is important and that smart, intelligent regulation that helps to protect users and helps to protect their privacy but also doesn't stifle innovation is going to be important,\" he said.</p><p>\"But the important thing with all of that is that we have consistent standards around the world, otherwise Australian companies would potentially find it harder to go to market in other contexts.\"</p><p>The Summit featured several staunch defenders of the platforms including WiseTech Global founder and chief executive Richard White, who said it would be a waste of time to try and break up Google and Facebook.</p><p>White, who has created a global software platform for logistics worth about $10 billion, said throwing regulation at the two companies \"won't solve the problem\".</p><p>AirTree Ventures founder and partner Daniel Petre was concerned the ACCC's recommendation to limit acquisition of small companies would \"effectively neuter\" certain segments of the start-up ecosystem.</p><p>But in a comment that surprised many at the Summit, Steven Worrall, managing director of Microsoft Australia, said the break-up of big tech companies should be a possible remedy. He said this was a general comment and not aimed specifically at Google and Facebook.</p><p>Innovation funding</p><p>Many panellists supported the recommendations made three years ago by the government's advisory board on innovation and science to direct more funding into companies that collaborate. It is staggering there has been industry consensus on this for many years but the government has done nothing about it.</p><p>Bill Ferris, who led Innovation and Science Australia when it published its 2030 blueprint for innovation funding, repeated his call for a quadrupling of the government investment into co-operative research centres. Several panellists identified the fatal flaw in Australia's innovation policy and that is the lack of a well thought through and co-ordinated policy.</p><p>Alex Zelinsky, vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle, said we don't have an industry policy. He said the government needed to step in and use its financial power to be a matchmaker and galvanise sectors and industries.</p><p>Vicki Thomson, chief executive of Go8, which represents the country's largest universities, said the funding model for basic research was broken because universities were now reliant on the inflows of foreign students.</p><p>Stevens, who is chairman of Innovation and Science Australia, said he is preparing a report on business expenditure on R&amp;D and innovation. Based on research by consulting economists, AlphBeta, Stevens has found that business expenditure on R&amp;D is at least matched by additional expenditure in other innovation type activities like business models and ICT investment.</p><p>The study, which will be published at the end of the year, has found that investment in business models and ICT are highly correlated with higher levels of growth.</p><p>Government infrastructure</p><p>Australia has always rated highly in international surveys of government involvement in innovation infrastructure. This was confirmed in the latest Global Innovation Index published last week.</p><p>It says two of Australia's greatest strengths are online government services and the community's participation in the use of these services.</p><p>At the Summit, Charles Walton, senior vice-president, digital identity products, Mastercard USA, revealed Australia's investment in digital identification was raised at a meeting at the White House with Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>Kushner, who is a senior adviser to President Trump, was \"really interested\" in what Australia was doing with digital identification, Walton said.</p><p>He said Mastercard's chief executive, Ajaypal Singh Banga, attended the meeting at the White House and the officials in the meeting wanted to know more.</p><p>Defining success</p><p>The Summit was fortunate to have the participation of two proven corporate success stories - WiseTech and CSL. They provide lessons in relation to targeted government intervention and letting capitalist market forces rip.</p><p>CSL is the world's largest platform for the collection and fractionation of plasma. But one of its most famous products, Gardisil, a vaccine that protects young women from cervical cancer, only exists because of federal government funding of basic research. WiseTech's White said the best companies don't need R&amp;D tax incentives. But he said WiseTech had received a modest amount of R&amp;D money and would not be returning it.</p><p>TONY BOYD</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76fh00ruoztklgu7bix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-0K61-F0J6-J4CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A national law, the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can target specific consumers. Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. </p><p>The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation. Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up. The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law. The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely. Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions. \"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\" Congressional pressure A House committee was to press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication. Facebook, used by 2 billion-plus people - including more than 200 million in the U.S. - has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law. Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability. \"The internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\" Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\" \"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Keith Enright, Google's chief privacy officer, said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\" Looking to Europe A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business - their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp. Britain has also unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse. The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast amounts of data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99 percent of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85 percent, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA. Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the \"other\" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its \"other\" revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017. Ad discrimination? The tech giants' relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties. The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists. Besides crafting a bipartisan data-privacy measure in Congress, lawmakers are considering restoring Obama-era rules that formerly barred internet providers - such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and Comcast - from discriminating against certain technologies and services. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has proposed fines and jail time for executives of companies guilty of data breaches. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, representing chief executives of major companies, have presented their own proposals to curb privacy abuses. Among the tech giants that are trying to shape any final restrictions is the chipmaker Intel, which has developed its own legislative proposal. \"I think it's likely we are going to pass a national privacy law by the end of 2020,\" David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer, said in an interview. By then, the privacy measure emerging in California will have taken effect. \"The California bill is responsible for 90 percent of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,\" said Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives. Four senators - Republicans Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii - are working on a national measure they say would protect consumers from the abuse of their data and provide legal certainty to ensure that tech companies continue to hire and innovate. \"It would be nice,\" said Wicker, who leads the key Senate Commerce Committee, \"to have it on the president's desk this year.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN66163577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWT-M6M1-DYRV-405P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1204\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

If you've ever tried to receive an email from me through Gmail, it probably went to spam. My company runs its own email server, and Google feels that our mail authentication is inadequate. And remember those Flash-based websites from the aughts?</p><p> They're longer supported by major browsers, and entirely blocked from Apple's mobile devices. Every now and then, we see attempts to re-open the internet. Last month, for example, Twitter announced Bluesky, a project to create an open protocol for social media. If adopted, Bluesky would allow anyone to spin up a Twitter clone and host a social network. Content could be shared across platforms - for example, a Twitter user could retweet a post from a Bluesky version of Facebook, allowing her followers to interact with the post without switching accounts. There are plenty of other examples. One of the older ones is XMPP, an open protocol developed for social networking and chatting. The project began in 1999, and was adopted and later abandoned by AOL Instant Messenger, Facebook Chat and Google Talk. (Once a platform gains significant market share, there are competitive advantages to using a proprietary protocol.) A more recent introduction comes from Mastodon, a decentralized social network as well as a software, in the form of ActivityPub. You know where I'd really like to see open protocols? On the entire rest of the internet. Take Wikipedia, regarded as a definitive source of truth by fact-checkers on Facebook and Youtube. After criticizing Wikipedia's oligarchic editing process, a former co-founder created the Knowledge Standards Foundation to promote an open protocol where anyone can host wiki-type encyclopedia pages. Custom reading interfaces can then fetch pages from sources preferred by the individual user. Then there's Google Search. Google's prowess doesn't come from hundreds of petabytes stored on index servers, although that does create a massive barrier to entry for competitors. The company's dominance comes from its proprietary ranking algorithm, designed to deliver the worthiest links to the top of a user's search results. Google has been accused of de-ranking certain sites, promoting political biases, or even spreading disinformation. An open protocol for Google Search could allow anyone to set up a web server to receive queries and forward them to the index servers, then rank results using competing algorithms. The approach could be extended to any content platform. The challenge, of course, is making a profit. It's hard for platforms to monetize an open protocol - it's like trying to make money off of email. Jack Dorsey explained how an open protocol might be good for Twitter: \"It will allow us to access and contribute to a much larger corpus of public conversation, focus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms which promote healthy conversation, and will force us to be far more innovative than in the past.\" No company truly wants to be forced to innovate - Jack was just going for a tricolon - but the first two points are valid. As a non-dominant social network, Twitter could benefit from accessing external content, just like Google gains access to new data each time a Gmail user corresponds with an external email address. Distributed platforms also give companies a way to avoid the messy problem of content moderation. Google contracts with more than 10,000 search quality raters who spend their days evaluating controversial search results, while Facebook has hired 15,000 moderators to manage problematic content. With a federated internet, these companies would not have to employ so many moderators, or worry about creating a catch-all policy that attempts to please everybody - anyone who didn't like one server's content policies could simply start their own social network. No one complains to Mastodon about unsatisfactory moderation rules, because the host of a Mastodon server can implement whatever filters or amplification algorithms they want without losing access to external content. This doesn't necessarily mean that nasty content will take over the internet. When a controversial social network called Gab created a Mastodon instance, many other servers simply preemptively blocked it. Rather than adhering to content rules imposed in a top-down manner, individual communities make their own rules and create an actual marketplace of ideas. Requiring open protocols could even be part of an antitrust approach to increasing competition among big tech companies. Back in March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that regulators should guarantee the principle of data portability between services. If regulators go a step further and promote interoperability as well, it could be the modern-day equivalent of forcing Bell Labs to liberate their patents. Compulsory sharing of technology may not have been advantageous to the Bell System, but it certainly increased U.S. innovation in the long run. Elaine Ou is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Also, as Brexit remains a pressing concern for British businesses, we're pleased to introduce those who have made the most of the opportunities available and are our contenders for Brexporter of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TECH COMPANY OF THE YEAR \u00a6ARM Holdings: Cambridge-based ARM hit the headlines in the days after the Brexit referendum, when the UK's largest technology business agreed a \u00a324 billion takeover by Japanese conglomerate, Softbank. Until this point ARM was probably the most successful UK tech firm you had never heard of, shipping more than 15 billion microchips last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ARM's core processors are found in all iPhones and most smartphones and tablets. With the backing of its Japanese parent ARM is expected to begin making the components for an array of connected devices, as the internet of things becomes a reality.</p><p>ARM represents the best of British tech and until now has managed to fly under the radar. Under Japanese ownership the company finally has the opportunity to show the world what it is made of.</p><p>Micro Focus: Barely was the ink dry on ARM Holdings' sale to Softbank, then Micro Focus revealed its own audacious deal to <person><nameText>snap </nameText></person>up the software business of Hewlett PackardEnterprise, a US tech giant. The global software company has bought up lots of legacy software businesses and works with some of the world's largest companies, like Tesco and Bentley, to get the most out of the software and operating systems they use. Micro Focus helps old technology \"talk\" to new in sectors such as banking, so that companies can hold onto their old systems for longer. The Newbury company's acquisition of HPE will treble the size of the business and mark Micro Focus out as the world's consolidator of legacy systems.</p><p>Purplebricks: This online estate agency, with its cheeky advertising campaigns, aims to shake up the world of buying and selling property. House sellers pay a flat-rate fee which is about a quarter of the going rate for a conventional agent. Founded in 2014 by two brothers, who sold their Midlands High-Street agency, Purplebricks has flourished by building a brand that, unlike other online agencies, offers local expertise. With the backing of Neil Woodford's fund, the online/offline hybrid company has been able to leapfrog the usual rounds of fundraising through venture capital and go straight to a listing on AIM. It has already entered the Australian market and has set its sights on the US.</p><p><person><nameText>Snap</nameText></person>: Snap Incis the company that runs the Snapchat social media network your children are using obsessively. Co-founded by chief executive Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy in 2011, <person><nameText>Snap </nameText></person>has three products: Snapchat, Spectacles and Bitmoji. Its unique selling point is that posts disappear within minutes of having sent them. <person><nameText>Snap </nameText></person>was the biggest tech listing in several years when it floated on Nasdaq in March, valued at $28 billion (\u00a322 billion), but its shares have taken a pounding since then, because of slowing growth in the latest quarter. Like many of the big tech companies, profit is elusive at <person><nameText>Snap, </nameText></person>which made a $2.2 billion loss last year. Growth may no longer be stratospheric, but <person><nameText>Snap </nameText></person>says that three billion posts a day are made on its network.</p><p>With respected analysts at Goldman Sachs suggesting revenue could grow five-fold, <person><nameText>Snap </nameText></person>is still being touted in many corners as the stand-out tech company of the year.</p><p>BREXPORTER OF THE YEAR \u00a6Asos: Where some businesses were stopped in their tracks by last June's referendum result, the UK's largest independent online fashion retailer took it as a cue to expand overseas even more aggressively. Asos invested hard in overseas pricing and the capacity of its international business. The signs are that the strategy is working with a 54% increase in revenues from its overseas division in the six months to the end of February.</p><p>In the UK, a potential concern for analysts, sales have also climbed 18%, despite the tougher environment. Asos, which has 4000 staff in the UK, still sits on AIM but with a valuation of nearly \u00a35 billion, it would comfortably lodge in the FTSE 100. This is one unicorn that really is fulfilling its potential and Brexit is proving a powerful wind beneath its wings.</p><p>Dairy Crest: Britain's largest dairy company processes more than half a billion litres of milk a year to make more than 50,000 tonnes of branded cheese, including the Davidstow premium brand.</p><p>The company has seen its input prices soar since the Brexit referendum, with milk prices up by more than 8p per litre and a doubling of cream prices because of the weaker pound. However, Dairy Crest is battling back and has reported higher sales of its iconic cheddar Cathedral City, the UK's favourite cheese.</p><p>Having sold its dairies business last year to M\u00fcller, the company says it is now a leaner, more focused organisation. In the face of Brexit uncertainty, it is stepping up research and innovation. Investments in whey processing in Cornwall could prove a gear-changer for the company.</p><p>BBA Aviation: BBA Aviation provides services to the private, commercial and military aircraft world in five continents. Two years ago it bought Landmark, a US rival in a $2 billion deal. The acquisition, which completed just over a year ago, was transformational in that it brought together BBA's subsidiary, Signature - the number one private jet firm in the US - and Landmark (America's third largest), cementing BBA Aviation's position as the world's biggest operator of private jets.</p><p>With Britain's exit from the EU now in negotiation, the company's move to increase its exposure to the US and to enhance the quality of earnings it receives from that region, now looks like a very smart move.</p><p>Prudential: Parts of the insurance industry are positively salivating at the prospect of Brexit, which will set them free from the EU's Solvency II regulations. Prudential, although a Remain supporter, is one of those which has a strong and growing international business, but believes that EU rules have inhibited its ability to compete globally.</p><p>Asia is the new engine of Prudential's growth, thanks to its fast-growing middle class and recent results have underlined this. The insurer, which celebrates its 170th birthday next year, saw profits rise by 7% to \u00a34.3 billion last year, although profits in the UK fell by a third.</p><p>Prudential is also flying the flag in Africa, where it recently opened in four new markets.</p><p>International growth translates into tangible domestic benefits, with \u00a3319 million paid in UK corporation tax during 2016.</p><p>The Evening Standard Business Awards, in association with HSBC and supported by Ballymore, will be held at Banqueting House, Whitehall, on June 29.

Elizabeth Warren could get elected president next year, a Barclays analyst has put together a chart showing what she could accomplish in the White House without having to work with Congress. </p><p>The Massachusetts Democrat could use executive orders, presidential memorandums, proclamations and appointments to regulatory agencies in order achieve her policy goals, said Shawn Golhar, the bank's head of public policy research, in a note Monday.  His handy chart, shown below, suggests Warren could go it alone in 21 policy areas. The areas include more actively managing the dollar  DXY, -0.24%[1] , breaking up Big Tech  XLK, 1.20%[2] and banning fracking on federal lands.'Given her consistent political ideology and policies of 'big structural' change, her polling in national and early states, and the stream of questions from investors and corporates, we feel it is prudent to consider her policies and their effects on the markets  SPX, 0.97%[3] ,' Golhar wrote.

She is the front-runner, however, in averages of polls for Iowa[7] and New Hampshire[8], the two states that get to pick first in the Democratic primary.

In recent days, German antitrust authorities struck a modest blow in consumers' favour. The ruling of the Federal Cartel Office will prohibit Facebook from aggregating personal information it collects from consumers with that collected by its subsidiaries including WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook will appeal. The stakes are high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October last year, Tim Cook, the CEO of technology behemoth Apple, blew the whistle on the destruction of our privacy at the hands of major technology companies. In a speech to the European Parliament, he condemned the \"data industrial complex\" - in which we unwittingly hand over our personal information to companies in exchange for access to the internet. In calling for greater regulation, Cook argued: \"Our own information - from the every day to the deeply personal - is being weaponised against us ...\"</p><p>The business of watching our every move on the web, recording it and selling it was perfected by big tech monopolies Facebook, Google, Amazon and their Silicon Valley followers. By selling it to companies seeking to target advertisements at us, they have become some of the richest and arguably most powerful corporations in the history of capitalism.</p><p>US digital technology expert Shoshana Zuboff coined the term \"surveillance capitalism\" to describe this business model. Pioneered by Facebook, it became the default model for Silicon Valley. It now resembles a data free-for-all. Your digital devices generate enormous information about you. The GPS system in your car records when, where and how fast you drive. Car companies obtain that data every day, enabling them to track your every movement in your car, aggregate the data you produce and sell it to other businesses.</p><p>The age of surveillance capitalism has also spawned an industry of data brokers who construct elaborate profiles of our lives and sell them to banks, insurers, telcos, retailers, big technology companies and others. Our profiles include information about our political leanings and affiliations, personality traits, dating and sexual preferences, our taste in clothes. According to the Financial Times, computer software company Oracle obtains extensive personal data from more than 80 data brokers to accumulate up to 30,000 data attributes for each individual.</p><p>The data we generate can also be sold to governments, political parties and purveyors of the dark arts such as Cambridge Analytica. Data about medical devices we use can be sold to insurers.</p><p>According to Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the US-based Centre for Digital Democracy, we are all now \"invisibly attached to a living, breathing database\".</p><p>And yet we are fiercely opposed to intrusions on our privacy. Health Minister Greg Hunt recently suggested that up to 10 per cent of eligible people may opt out of the digital My Health system. The Australian Community Attitudes to Privacy is a regular survey of our views. In 2017, 16 per cent of people surveyed indicated they would avoid dealing with a government agency to manage concerns about privacy while 58 per cent would avoid dealing with a private company.</p><p>In December, federal Parliament rushed through laws to let police and other security forces obtain encrypted information of criminal suspects. The legislation requires technology companies to co-operate with law-enforcement agencies in the investigation of online terrorism, child sexual offences and a range of other crimes. It was roundly condemned by tech firms, digital rights groups, the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Law Council of Australia.</p><p>Still, each day we log on to Google, Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and mutely shed our privacy. For most of us, the internet is now a necessity of life - a utility like electricity or water. The price of online life is signing up to non-negotiable, incomprehensible contracts that let technology companies plunder our data.</p><p>Our existing privacy laws are woefully inadequate. A significant and influential part of the online community remains wedded to the \"Californian ideology\" spouted by early Silicon Valley entrepreneurs: an odd mix of individualism, libertarianism and neo-liberalism - and leftists who continue to prophesy that the information technology revolution will supplant capitalism with a system of collaborative production.</p><p>If there is a way out of this dangerous mess, Europe is leading the charge. In May 2018, new data protection laws, aimed at empowering consumers to give informed consent about the use of their data, were introduced. In recent weeks, the French data protection regulator fined Google a record (EURO)50 million ($80 million) for failing to provide comprehensible information to consumers about its use of their data.</p><p>In Australia, the ACCC has commenced an investigation and has already indicated it favours stronger consumer protections. It is due to report in June. It is difficult to be optimistic. Meaningful reform will necessarily involve disrupting the disrupters - that is, dismantling the immensely lucrative business model of the most powerful corporations on Earth.</p><p>Josh Bornstein is an employment lawyer and writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc73zkugzybhl18joasi5q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCJ-TY61-JD34-V36Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Among them are a failure to adequately safeguard the privacy of citizens, a reluctance to hold big business accountable, and a lack of understanding of the issue among senators.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>It also illuminated the need for Congress and state legislatures to protect consumers and establish standards for social media companies.<br/>The odds of that happening appear slim in the wake of Zuckerberg's testimony, which included tiresome apologies for failing to keep private data private. Facebook - and similar companies - cull mountains of information regarding the personal lives and personal preferences of citizens for the purpose of selling that information to advertisers. It is a smart business model, one that has made Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over, but it is one that belies the idea of privacy. For example, Facebook collects data even about people who are not members of the site.<br/>All of this has drawn new attention in the wake of the 2016 election. Facebook exposed the data of up to 87 million users to a Russian-American researcher at Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign.<br/>Regardless of the influence of Cambridge Analytica and its targeted advertisements (and targeted fake news) during the campaign, the fact is that those who voted for Donald Trump had myriad reasons for doing so. It would be inaccurate to suggest that the meddling swayed the election, but it also would be misguided to ignore the impact outside forces are having on our democratic system.<br/>The failure of the United States to take data privacy seriously stands in contrast to what is being done in Europe. On May 25, the European Union will enact the General Data Protection Regulation, a new privacy law designed to ensure that consumers understand what information is being collected. Among the provisions, companies that collect data must request consent from users; firms must notify users of a data breach within 72 hours of discovering it; and companies must allow users to request a copy of the information that has been collected about them.<br/>Judging from last week's hearings, such detailed protections appear to be beyond the scope of Congress, as several senators revealed they have little understanding of how Facebook and social media work. In questioning Zuckerberg about possible oversight, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, \"OK, would you submit to us some proposed regulations?\"<br/>Allowing the fox to guard the henhouse has become all too common for Congress, which frequently allows stakeholders to devise solutions for the problems they have created. Consulting experts who can view an issue from all angles would be a far more effective approach. As Lee Drutman wrote for Vox.com: \"This is how corporate power works in Washington these days. Time and time again, it's the industry lobbyists who write the bills. That's just what Graham is used to seeing. Why should this time be different?\"<br/>The loser in that process is the public. Four years ago, big tech companies fought against a proposed online bill of rights; that opposition has had predictable results. Citizens should let lawmakers around the country know that we expect our online activity to remain private instead of allowing it to be viewed as a vein of gold ready for mining.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-7194253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4W-NT71-DY7P-P4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Columbian Publishing Co.

I'm sure I have one here who has experienced them. They don't [have] them very much. But it is my pleasure to introduce next Dr. Keith Dunleavy and Jonathan Boldt, the CEO and the CFO of Inovalon. We also have Kim Collins over there on the other side running IR. So let's get right into it, just [because] we are running a little bit late. For those that are new in the room to the story, could you just walk us through Inovalon, what you do, what did you do, where are you going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEITH R. DUNLEAVY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, INOVALON HOLDINGS, INC.: Great. Thanks, Stephanie, and thanks to Citi for having us, and good morning, everybody. And sorry for running a few minutes late. We had gamified the elevators. So Inovalon is a company that provides cloud-based platforms empowering data-driven health care.</p><p>We provide the capabilities and solutions necessary for health plans, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies and provider organizations to deliver on the increasingly digitally driven health care environment. The primary focus of the digital capabilities are to improve clinical quality outcomes and the economic performance of the organizations.</p><p>We do this across the entire United States and provide our solutions to several tens of thousands of clients at this point, the top 24 of the top 25 health plans, 21 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies and tens of thousands of provider organizations.</p><p>We're unique in the marketplace in that our platform provides 4 critical requirements to enable data-driven health care. Those requirements are connectivity, data, analytics, intervention capabilities and then comprehensive reporting. If you divide them actually, you can actually come up with 5. Those capabilities make Inovalon stand out in our ability to give end-to-end enablement of data-driven health care in the marketplace. Let me walk through that for you for a moment.</p><p>Before I walk through it, it's important for you to understand the scale of our platform. Inovalon, in providing its capabilities in the way that I describe, has within it the nation's largest primary source data set. You're going to hear a lot of companies talk about the size of their data set. So we should talk a little bit today about how uniquely different our data set is.</p><p>But our data set is on approximately 278 million patients, about 46 billion medical events, data pertaining to approximately 980,000 providers across the U.S. And that data allows for us to do a real-time comparative analytics that improve not only outcomes and economics for organizations but care for individual patients.</p><p>What Stephanie referred to is what's happening now, why are we sitting here now, why should you be potentially interested in Inovalon shares today versus yesterday. Inovalon has gone through a very significant transformation and stands today as the leader in its space. There's no other organization in the U.S. that has achieved this cloud-based platform and such a large affirmation by the marketplace. But we came to that through a number of stepwise processes that we've undertaken over the last several years.</p><p>We transitioned our entire platform from an enterprise software platform to a modular cloud-based platform. We transformed our entire sales force expanding it significantly from approximately 15 persons to now well over 200 persons and transitioned the way we sell from a subject matter expertise to a technology sale.</p><p>We transitioned our business model from a legacy contract structure -- license contract structure to a subscription-based contract structure. And we've also dramatically expanded our breadth of capabilities through both organic and inorganic combinations so that we're now not only supplying services into the payer space but the payer space, the provider space, the pharmacy space and the life sciences space.</p><p>So Inovalon today is a cloud-based provider to the vast majority of the United States, growing this year between 20...</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT, CFO, INOVALON HOLDINGS, INC.: It's 23%.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: 23% at our midpoint for this year as reported organically. That's between 13% and 15%, I believe, with gross margins at 74%, EBITDA margins at 33-or-so percent, and we've raised our earnings guidance twice already this year. We have extremely strong growth in sales that have been accelerating quite nicely with trailing 12-month numbers that are up 60%, 70%, 80% in many areas.</p><p>So incredibly strong adoption by the Street. We see it just getting better and better. We're really excited about how it's going and we see a really bright future.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Thank you, Keith. And you mentioned the data and I was [thinking that's] a very important part of your story, the identified versus deidentified data of all of your peers. How did you get that identified data and why can't someone do that now?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Yes. So let's talk about what the data is and then talk about how it would be very hard for anybody else to put something like this in place. So our data is primary source, identified, longitudinally matched data across the spectrum of everything that a patient would have. So that's called your closed portfolio data or there's a number of different names in the marketplace.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: And for someone who's less familiar with health care, what is that?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Sure. So let's talk about -- so let's take like an EHR provider. So somebody provides an electronic health care records system to their whole hospital system or something like this. That would contain generally about 15% of the information about that patient. The average Medicare patient in the United States sees roughly 6.2 different doctors per year. The average doctor sees patients at more than one location. Therefore, a patient's data is spread amongst somewhere between 10 and 15 different systems, if you will.</p><p>So no one of those systems, no one of those EHRs, no one of those hospital systems or administrative systems knows the complete picture of that patient and therefore, really can't make care recommendations or concerns or changes in how care should be handled.</p><p>We, on the other hand, have what's called closed system data, meaning everywhere that patient has gone, we can longitudinally match them and align that information. So if they go to vacation down in Orlando and break their arm, our system is aware of that. If they had a lab done out of network or go see a dermatologist that's out of network, that information is in our system.</p><p>So in addition to being able to do what most organizations are familiar with data-driven analytics, like if I want to price a drug, I need cohort data of large scale, but I can't direct individual care with that cohort data. We on the other hand can do both, right? We can obviously, deidentify our data and do cohort analyses. But more powerfully and more valuably, by virtue of the fact that our data is longitudinally matched and identified, we can provide tools to our clients that allow for decision support on the individual level to increase outcomes, quality of outcomes and improve the economics of the organization.</p><p>So how did we get that data? So first of all, we've been at this for a long time. We started -- we're now roughly 20 years in. And when we started doing data aggregation in the early 2000s, it was prior to HIPAA becoming a primary focus of the marketplace. And we started to aggregate data from our client base to inform a better ability to deliver solutions to our client base.</p><p>And as we roll the clock forward, we're able to go to a client and say we have constructed our data architecture in a way that adheres to all the HIPAA requirements and the regulatory agency requirements because of the isolation of how the individual data sets are maintained and how the aggregation of data is maintained. But you, a potential client, are going to receive a multiple factor of value by your contribution of data into the system.</p><p>So we are able to go to a new client and say, \"Yes, you're a large client. You have 1 million additional patients, but we have 278 million patients in our system. Therefore, the value of analytical improvement that you will gain from becoming part of this platform vastly exceeds the unquantifiable benefit that you have by not doing it.\"</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: And is there less of a regulatory issue because you are then just a drop in a large base?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Well, there's a lot of benefits to -- at this point in the way we do it. First of all, a 20-year track record of very strong governance and shepherding, if you will, of the data. The federal government themselves has provided data into our system. We have all the Medicare data of the United States in our system by virtue of an uncommon set of what's called QE, Qualified Entity arrangements with the federal government. We help the government model future quality outcomes studies. So the way that we have architected things has been very broadly accepted and adopted by our client base and even regulators in the marketplace.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: So now that you have all of this data, other folks can have it. Talk to me about what you can do with them, what's differentiated as opposed to your peers?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So the -- all of health care today in the United States health care system and increasingly around the world is a -- what's called a relative performance marketplace. So payment models, incentivization models and regulatory models are now being derived not based upon how you did as a doctor or as a hospital or as a health plan but how you did compared to how everybody else is doing and in the marketplace that typically doesn't get found out or publicly disclosed until quite a while after a data service period. So typically, the quality performance for the United States is published by the federal government in October of the subsequent year.</p><p>So if you are a hospital or a health plan, an ACO, a provider group, any one of the organizations that are under these regulations and it is September 5, 2019, how are you supposed to improve upon your performance so that you know how you're going to do financially for 2019, let alone try to do better?</p><p>You need to be able to have all of your patient and activities analyzed in real time compared to what you're ultimately going to be measured against. And you have to have a massive amount of data to know not just how your organization is doing but how the rest of the country or the relevant cohorts are doing in order to run those analytics. So you need massive compute capability and access to the data and connectivity so that it's timely data.</p><p>So we have the ability to do analytics that change individual care, intervention and quality outcome during a data service period by virtue of our platforms. What's more is as the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning has arrived and you have to search pretty long and hard to find those terms in our company's materials because we don't tout them in the second or third sentence as a lot of companies might do, to us, that's a way of life.</p><p>And to be able to drive strong AI or machine learning capabilities, as everybody knows, you need massive, diverse and up-to-date data sets. And so our ability to train our infrastructure on complex scenarios very rapidly is a material advantage in our business that has been leading to material advantage to our customers.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: I also think it's pretty interesting to talk about how you diversified in your client base. So when I think of legacy Inovalon, you were a data analytics provider purely to one end market payer facing. That's a very different case now. Who are your clients, how to they diversify, where is it going?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So when you look back 5 years ago, as Stephanie pointed out, the company was substantially all focused on the payer space, large health plans. And we increasingly were finding that the analytics we were performing for a health plan was applicable to a provider system as provider systems increasingly started to look like or tried to launch health plans.</p><p>The regulation started to make it so that providers were also more able to act like a health plan through things like ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly were interested in the data and how to improve patient uptake for a drug or formulary inclusion of a drug or how to get a drug to market more quickly and so on and so forth. So we started organically expanding into those other verticals, the verticals of the provider systems, the verticals of the pharmaceutical and life sciences space and the verticals of the pharmacy space.</p><p>To accelerate that, we added an inorganic acquisition in each one of those spaces between 2015 and 2018. So in each one of those, we methodically went out and found who we thought was the best in that space that was cloud-based in its capabilities or could further accelerate our cloud-based ambitions. And so we went out and added to our life sciences capability, our pharmacy capability and our provider capability.</p><p>So today or in 2018 at least, we finished the year at roughly 50% payer, 30% provider and 20% pharmacy life sciences. And diversification of client base is dramatically positive as well. When -- in 2015, we had approximately 105 or so clients with client concentration that are top 10 clients representing 76% of revenue. Today, it's a very different story. We have tens of thousands of clients today. We have no client of such size, nobody that comes close to 10% anymore. And in fact, our top 10 is around 40-ish or so percent.</p><p>So significant diversification in -- that helps us grow a lot faster. Significant diversification that helps us in the stability of the company. And I'll point out, we've gone through many renewal cycles with that client base and expanded it quite a bit.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: You've shifted right now on these end markets kind of via acquisitions, but do you see any pockets of growth or opportunity that could change this mix shift?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Well, an area that we still have our eye on and we haven't done yet is the consumer space. So we are now quite nicely positioned in payer, provider, pharmacy and life sciences. And we're very pleased with -- we're seeing double-digit growth in all of those spaces. We're very pleased with how that's going. And we strongly believe that health care, like every other major industry sector, whether it be retail, whether it be financial services, whether it be entertainment, whether it be travel, have all ultimately moved to the consumer space.</p><p>In our view, the catalysts that do that are the aspect of transparency and actionability. So in each one of those segments, I would argue, if you look at what led to the travel agency transitioning, what led to entertainment, what led to retail was the ability of an end consumer to have transparency, what's available, how much does it cost, is it better than something else, and actionability, how do I get it now. The key to that is data accessibility.</p><p>So we believe very strongly that Inovalon will be a core at the transformation of consumerism in health care, and you'll see us increasingly focus on that, but we're going very, very strongly in all areas.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: How would you see a consumer-facing solution because I -- the issue I always have with consumer analytics is you can provide me the data, but I also know my data by unfortunately having lived through all the different things in my health care. And so how would you add value with consumer?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Well, we don't want to give away too much. But first of all, you probably don't know which hospital could treat you better. You, like you, specifically you, you with condition X, Y and Z, medications A, B and C, history P, Q and R. You could possibly look up who does more hip transplants, but that's a somewhat irrelevant fact. Mind you, that frequency of a particular surgical intervention does correlate with better outcomes.</p><p>But what's more important is what's your cardiac function, what's your renal function, what medications are you on, which physician would you actually see, what is the timing that you're expecting. That's a very complex compute that we have billions of cases that train the ability of the platform to determine.</p><p>Where do you send your parents to post-acute care? How do you select the nursing home they go to? How do you select their care? How do you select whether they should go on to a particular medication? What cost is appropriate? What outcome should be expected?</p><p>If you look at the literature from the late '80s when the financial services industry was transforming into a consumer-led space, one of the interesting comments one repeatedly sees is the comment that the consumer would not be able to interpret the financial information to make an investment decision. It's commonly said in the literature in that period of time. You see that a lot about people making their own health care decisions today.</p><p>KIM E. COLLINS, SVP OF CORPORATE MARKETING &amp; COMMUNICATIONS, INOVALON HOLDINGS, INC.: [It's their] decision support [in the long run].</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Decision support. So data will drive all aspects of health care, how your doctor evaluates you, how you make choices and whoever controls and can translate into value that data will be a very, very key player in that space.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Now that you are moving more into data analytics, are you encountering the other players that are shifting into that, too? I mean you mentioned the EHR is -- but I think EHR is the big tech players and some of the ones today. They also talk about health care data and what they can do.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: There's a lot of people talking about analytics for sure. Inovalon really focuses on being the Inovalon Inside, the Intel Inside. We're less intent on being the flashy front cover. So when you click a button on an EHR, seeking the determination of what cancer screening should be done or what diabetes management would be most appropriate, there's a increasing likelihood that, that analysis was not done inside that EHR. That EHR does not have access to adequate information to do that calculation and no different than does -- a website that tells you what the weather's going to be -- actually have satellite systems and so forth.</p><p>So there's the front end and the marketplace has those front ends, but then there are the brains and the value add behind the scenes, which will increasingly be Inovalon. So other -- there are some recent high-value IPOs that have been out there. We applaud their valuation. I think Inovalon would be priced to like $200 a share if we do a comparable. But those are point solutions, and Inovalon has a very broad menu of capabilities. The holistic access to data is -- the identified data is key. And any organization claims to have a lot of data. What's very important is to understand is it identified as a primary source. People typically say...</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: And some of the EHRs are the data creators, right? Doesn't that -- that means they have identified data.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So that's correct. Whether they have rights to use that in identified format is typically unlikely. The -- they -- so they may have it. I assure you, we have vastly larger amounts of data than the data we make public. But the data that we make public is the data that we have the rights to do the work that we do on. So an EHR would say they have, in a very flashy way, an enormous amount of data. But as we've talked about, that data is a very narrow slice of that patient's life. It's saying, if you know -- an example, I think, that you provided me...</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: The lunch example.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: If you know what Stephanie had for lunch yesterday, that doesn't mean you know what Stephanie eats. It means you know what she ate yesterday at lunch. So -- and the EHR has very little data on a patient. That isn't to say they can't do anything with it, but one needs to be very mindful of what the limitations of it can be. They certainly can't recommend the right chemotherapeutic intervention for them, which is the super high-value stuff.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Could they be a partner because they are looking to monetize their data?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Absolutely. And we work with a significant number of the EHRs. We interconnect with a vast majority of them, NextGen, NeoDeck, Epic, Allscripts, athena, Cerner, Epic, if I haven't already said it.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Say it twice.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So we -- they play a very important role in the marketplace and we don't seek to do what they do. We seek to be the intelligence behind the scenes.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Understood. Understood. We've talked a lot about data analytics, but I think it's interesting because you read all your [old initiations]. There's a lot more on the services component. It's more of your legacy solutions lead. So how should we think about your transition away from that? And are you ever really going to be able to shift fully away from services?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So the way to think about Inovalon is it's a software platform. Many of our clients, the majority of our clients license or buy a subscription to that platform and pay us monthly based upon the number of patients they have. An amount -- that amount is dictated by how many modules or how sophisticated the processes they have purchased the subscription for. And then they -- their own people would use it. So let's take a couple of examples.</p><p>So we announced a large deal last year with Walgreens. So all of Walgreens' specialty pharmacy platforms, especially pharmacy has grown to be roughly 50% of the drug spend in the United States, that entire logistical process that goes from understating whether or not a patient can be started on a drug because of their kidney function, yes or no, to are they cleared for that drug payment-wise to do we have the right sign-offs on the tumor type and the stage of the cancer. There are many, many questions that go into these complex drugs that are called specialty pharmacy drugs and then dispensing and then revenue cycle management and all aspects of that.</p><p>That whole platform that Walgreens uses is our cloud platform. But Walgreens has a few thousand people that then operate that software. None of them are our employees. So that is a pure SaaS subscription-based platform offering with Walgreens.</p><p>Another client might come to us and say, \"That's great. I have a very similar situation. But I need 10 people to do this one component of what your software does. I don't have the time to go out and hire them. Do you have people that can do that?\" So for that, we do augment and help them with that.</p><p>And then we have a legacy piece that you talked about that has more labor component into it. We've materially eliminated that from our process through connectivity and automation and things like natural language processing, automation of data aggregation and normalization. So some of that will remain. I don't anticipate it going down to 0%. We have 7% legacy in our platform today. There -- until the day that health care is 100% digitized, there will be some aspect to that, but that day is not tomorrow.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: What services do you provide then? So of the legacy services that you used to have, has it shifted to more high-value services?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: It really has. So the benefit of transitioning our platform to a cloud-based modular platform has allowed for us to provide to the client world exactly what they wanted as opposed to a monolithic approach that we originally did. So if you go back 5 years, a client would have to buy a total solution and throw out whatever they had done. And maybe they have made some investments in that area. Maybe they had an IT department that had some capabilities. Maybe they had done an acquisition that had some capabilities. And so they had to decide to either walk away from that to use our platform or say no to us.</p><p>And by going to a cloud-based modular platform, we've been able to have them say, \"These are the parts and pieces that I need,\" which then also allowed us to learn what are the highest value pieces for our clients. So when I had to sell them the whole box, it was hard to really know which things they'd actually pay more for because there were some pieces in that box that they didn't want at all. So they thought that those were a waste, so it became a homogenized total price.</p><p>Now watching the behaviors and watching what they gain greatest value from has allowed us to sell more and more the high-value elements. So these are aspects of caring for the highest complexity patients, predictive analytics around specific disease identification and disease progression. These are things that improve the outcomes, the quality outcomes and predicting how the rest of the nation is moving.</p><p>Imagine your health organization that's spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to attract patients, improve the quality of care for those patients so you got better ratings in the marketplace and then deliver the patients a higher quality care at a lower cost. You're spending, in some cases, billions of dollars doing all that.</p><p>When we're able to point out the areas that they actually don't need to be doing it versus the areas they need to be doing more of it or the patients they really need to be interacting with versus the patients they don't really need to be interacting with or sadly, in some cases, the patients, through their behavioral analytics, no matter what they do, are not going to change what they're doing. That drives a tremendously high-value ROI for our clients. Our products nearly across the board make our clients a better economic situation. Typically, the ROI of our solutions are 7 or 8:1, sometimes higher.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: I often hear, when you're selling to health plans or selling to hospitals, they don't want just the data solution because it's hard to get the talent that can interpret all these data solutions and really utilize it in a proper way. Is that a services component that you still need to provide or have you found a way around it?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: So you bring up a really good point and that is...</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: [Is that] expensive?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: That there are a lot of parts of this ecosystem, the technology for health care ecosystem that are very expensive. There's a lot more to cloud-based health care solutions than the cloud. A question -- related question or akin question at least is do we compete with AWS or Azure? And we don't, right? We use them as infrastructure environments. We have our own private cloud environments and we also use the commercial cloud environments of Azure and AWS. We have a very positive relationship with them. We use their infrastructure, but they don't have health care data architects that do the things that we do. They don't have persons to interpret the subject matter content and so forth, and we can run a cloud environment with them less expensively than we can with ourselves.</p><p>So in a similar way, what types of head count, of personnel is it best for our clients to have, and we do advise on that sort of element. We can support that for when they need it. What we would ultimately like is to have that piece be them, be the employee of our client and us provide the solution platform.</p><p>And what we're seeing is, we've been doing this a long enough time, that those persons, when they move around and they go to the new employer, they ask for our solution. So we're seeing -- now that the cloud system has been out for about 3 years, we're now seeing the cloud solution being reseeded in other locations because employees that used it and had a good experience with it, moved somewhere else. It's a small ecosystem and they want to use our platform.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Good. Very good. We have a few minutes left. I'll open up the questions to the audience or I could keep just kind of rambling on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I just have a couple of questions. So in terms of business mix, can you talk about [devices] versus subscription revenue stream? Also you mentioned that you charge based on the number of locations for each client. Could you tell me what's the range of the price there? And what's the kind of recurring revenue stream now? Lastly, deleveraging plan...</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Great. Let me see if I can hit them all. If I don't hit them all, you let me know. Sure. So the breakdown last week, we publicly conveyed it, is we're 10% services revenue, 7% legacy, 83% subscription-based. And that 7% client base is rather content, very strongly content. We've tried to move them. We're now seeing good headway in moving them, but more to come on that.</p><p>And I will tell you that our renewals, so relatedly to that, we're seeing very strong client retention rates, which was part of the recurring revenue question that we came into this year at 103% client retention rates. So we're doing very well in the recurring nature of our base.</p><p>The -- we do get paid typically per patient or per some other patient-related event. Like in the pharmacy world, we get paid often in a combination equation between number of patients and the number of scripts, but there -- it's subscription nevertheless, just has a few other variables in the determination.</p><p>We don't disclose how much it is per -- because it can range quite a bit. We could do a outcomes analysis for a very large population at a low PMPM or per member per month fee rate. And then you could get into a pharmaceutical launch of a high-cost drug that would be a -- could go quite high per member per month. And so it is a range and sorry that I can't give too much more clarity on that.</p><p>And then on your last piece deleveraging. So we have very strong cash flow. Our net debt position last we reported was 800 and...</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: 50.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: $850 million. This year, the midpoint of our EBITDA projection is about 200 and...</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: 9.5.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: $209.5 million. And our cash flow has just been growing extremely well. So I think you can expect us to start paying down our debt. We obviously have been paying down our debt. There's a certain amount that we're required to. The whole thing is not due until 2023, but it's kind of a balloon at the end. But actually, our cash flow is so strong that you'll be seeing us pay that down early.</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: 2025.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: 2025. You mean the balloon is at 2025. But you'll be seeing us be paying it down. You can imagine the impact on our EPS as we pay that down. How much -- we already have an enormously strong operating leverage. Last quarter, we generated quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately $11 million -- $10 million. And our increase in EBITDA during the same period was...</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: 8.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: $8 million. So a pretty impressive amount of operational leverage. As we grow revenue, you can appreciate what that's going to do to our cash position. And then if you go down our guidance for this year, while we're growing our top line at roughly 21% to 23%, we're growing our bottom lines more than double that, meaning twice -- more than twice that rate. And as we start to pay down debt, you'll see that does a further acceleration of our EPS expansion.</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: And as we look to exit 2020, we're targeting a net debt leverage ratio of 3:1.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Or better.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Okay. (inaudible) Any other questions?</p><p>JONATHAN R. BOLDT: Good point.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: So moving on to the financial side of things. I do think it's interesting that you guys went from more of a single digit organic grower now to double digit. How should we think about the build there? And then how does your visibility compare where it used to be? Where -- if you want to talk about those years.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Yes. The -- there's a lot of visibility for us today by virtue of a number of different things. So let's talk about the things that -- let's talk about the numbers and then let's talk about the visibility. So how you build to this year's growth, first of all, we started with 103% client retention rate. So literally, without signing a new contract, we were already at 3% organic growth. Then as of November of last year, so almost a year ago, we had already signed enough new business for this year to add on top of that another 3% growth. So we were -- as of last November, we were already at 6% organic growth for this year.</p><p>Then if you look at our ACVs our annualized contract values that we've been reporting, this is the results of our expanded and more sophisticated sales force. They have been, by my opinion, extremely impressive. We've had year-over-year -- or trailing 12-month year-over-year growth rates of 50%, 60%, 70%, so really, really strong growth.</p><p>Now that growth takes us some time to -- you have to sign the business, you have to then implement it. There's a delay in that process and then you have this layering of that growth into the company. But now you've seen that for many quarters, 4 or 4-plus quarters. So that's starting to really mount up.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: So how do you think about that contribution?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Well, if you look at Q3 and Q4, we're -- Q3 guidance is somewhere around 13% organic and Q4 is somewhere around 23% organic. So you're starting to see those layers come in.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: So the gap to that 6% and 13% is just always [even]?</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: It's just all ACVs. And of course, you have a fundamental growth tailwind, things like Medicare patient population are growing at 10.5%, 11% because we have a subscription-based model. As patient count goes up, our revenue goes up. So if we can keep the client, that client typically buys more because we've been providing them a solution that makes them money and their patient count goes up.</p><p>We typically see that our client grows faster than the market average. We would love to take credit for it and say it's because we're making our client superpowered and they're able to then take those dollars and apply it into better marketing, better this, better that. But we certainly are -- I'd rather give the credit to the clients and we don't -- I don't know causality there, of course. But we have seen -- is that our client base compared to our nonclient base, our client base is growing faster than the market.</p><p>So you have organic tailwinds, you have client retention rates, you have organic sales and then you have acceleration of additionally CV sales.</p><p>STEPHANIE JULY DEMKO: Very helpful. Well, that's all the time we have today, but thank you so much, Keith and Jonathan, for coming here. Appreciate you being at our conference, and thank you, everyone, for coming and joining.</p><p>KEITH R. DUNLEAVY: Thanks, Stephanie.</p><p>JONATHAN R.

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brick-and-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them?\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared toward \"run-thebank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change-the-bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted.

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brick-and-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps.</p><p>McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon. com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them?\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared toward \"run-thebank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change-the-bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted.

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brick-and-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's thirdquarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them,\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared toward \"run-thebank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change the bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going toward the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gzochodne@nationalpost.com\">gzochodne@nationalpost.com</email> twitter.com/GeoffZochodne !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Germany's antitrust regulator used its competition authority to enforce principles of data privacy and processing. On February 7, 2019, the Bundeskartellamt issued a decision against Facebook, ruling that the practice of combining user personal data from different sources by a dominant market participant violated EU data protection law. This was a noteworthy decision from a competition authority being influenced by and seeking to enforce the General Data Protection Regulation, which would otherwise be enforced by data protection authorities. The decision is not yet final, but if upheld it could have the notable impact of limiting the data footprint used to inform advertising, and may influence regulators' willingness to use competition law to buttress limitations placed on the flexibility of data collectors and processors. Please see our previous client alert[2] on the Facebook ruling. If this approach informs the FTC's position on competition and privacy enforcement, it could extend a trend of regulators outside the data protection sphere using broader authority as a bridge to enforce privacy issues against companies they view to have a dominant market position.Looking ahead in the United States. The FTC made no direct mention of consumer privacy in its release[3] announcing the Technology Task Force and instead highlighted the need to \"closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition\" as an extension of is ongoing Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century[4]. However, the task force will be composed of staff attorney experts in areas including online advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platform businesses, all of which define a sizable portion of their respective markets through consumer data. Additionally, \"The FTC's Approach to Consumer Privacy[5]\" is scheduled as part of those hearings on April 9-10, 2019, and it will be interesting to see what role, if any, the newly created task force might have in that approach. Whether this new development will signal increased use of and reliance upon economic and cost-benefit analysis and an expansion of consumer welfare thinking at the FTC remains to be seen. However, recent calls from Congress[6] make clear that U.S. legislators have an increasing appetite[7] to use the tools of the FTC and competition policy in novel ways to address concerns about \"big tech.\"1Footnote1       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/gigantism-facebook-google-amazon-antitrust\">https://www.rollcall.com/news/gigantism-facebook-google-amazon-antitrust</url>[8](Rep.

Today, privacy and consumer data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protection of data has become a top concern for consumers, companies and authorities since March 2018, when it was revealed that the data of up to 50 million Facebook users was misused by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Several companies have been strengthening their privacy policies in the wake of the scandal, but the changes are damaging publishers' data businesses. For example, the International News Media Association (INMA) says in 2019 Google updated its Chrome browser and Apple changed its Safari protocols so that publishers can no longer detect incognito browsing, making metered pay gateways much more porous. The changes also made it more difficult to attribute a consumer's purchase to advertisements they saw on a website, diminishing a publisher's opportunity to make money.</p><p>Apple appears to like the secrecy such measures foster so much that INMA says in late 2019 it will roll out a \"Sign-in with Apple\" feature, offering anonymity as a default for consumers logging in, registering for or purchasing news online. The sign-in tool, INMA claims, will be mandatory for any developer that currently uses social sign-in widgets and will only give publisher's anonymized consumer data unless users request otherwise.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Adopt uniform law on privacy and data usage.</p><p>INMA is a fan of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which ushered in a wave of stronger privacy policies and added regulation of tech companies, when they came into effect in May 2018.</p><p>INMA would like to see tech giants use GDPR as the standard for its operations in every country and would like governments around the world to adopt complementary regulations, which would deter companies from getting around safeguards by operating in other countries with looser policies.</p><p>Share agreed data.</p><p>There is a lack of standardization around the collection of data, soliciting consumer permissions to hold such data and deciding when and how it should be shared. INMA says Google shares news subscription data with publishers whose content it aggregates, as does Facebook through its recent beta trial with publishers. Apple, however, does not and should allow customers to opt-in to sharing information with publishers like its competitors do, says INMA. \"It needs to update its long-held view that someone who purchases news from a publisher via an Apple platform is not actually also the publisher's customer,\" the organization argues.</p><p>Fix data stranglehold by loosening the platform trap.</p><p>INMA feels tech giants should allow publishers to conduct monetary transactions through their own software without forcing them to use the platform's offerings. Those platforms, INMA argues, should also stop the \"platform trap\" by sending readers directly to publications' websites when they click articles from such publications on social media. \"Apple News at present holds the reader in an Apple bubble with the publisher oblivious to content usage behaviours within that cone of silence,&amp;#8221; INMA argues. \"But those behaviours would be vital input for publishers to help optimize their digital experience for users.\"</p><p>News in the era of big tech</p><p>A Star series is examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.

Today, privacy and consumer data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protection of data has become a top concern for consumers, companies and authorities since March 2018, when it was revealed that the data of up to 50 million Facebook users was misused by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Several companies have been strengthening their privacy policies in the wake of the scandal, but the changes are damaging publishers' data businesses. For example, the International News Media Association (INMA) says in 2019 Google updated its Chrome browser and Apple changed its Safari protocols so that publishers can no longer detect incognito browsing, making metered pay gateways much more porous. The changes also made it more difficult to attribute a consumer's purchase to advertisements they saw on a website, diminishing a publisher's opportunity to make money.</p><p>Apple appears to like the secrecy such measures foster so much that INMA says in late 2019 it will roll out a \"Sign-in with Apple\" feature, offering anonymity as a default for consumers logging in, registering for or purchasing news online. The sign-in tool, INMA claims, will be mandatory for any developer that currently uses social sign-in widgets and will only give publisher's anonymized consumer data unless users request otherwise.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Adopt uniform law on privacy and data usage.</p><p>INMA is a fan of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which ushered in a wave of stronger privacy policies and added regulation of tech companies, when they came into effect in May 2018.</p><p>INMA would like to see tech giants use GDPR as the standard for its operations in every country and would like governments around the world to adopt complementary regulations, which would deter companies from getting around safeguards by operating in other countries with looser policies.</p><p>Share agreed data.</p><p>There is a lack of standardization around the collection of data, soliciting consumer permissions to hold such data and deciding when and how it should be shared. INMA says Google shares news subscription data with publishers whose content it aggregates, as does Facebook through its recent beta trial with publishers. Apple, however, does not and should allow customers to opt-in to sharing information with publishers like its competitors do, says INMA. \"It needs to update its long-held view that someone who purchases news from a publisher via an Apple platform is not actually also the publisher's customer,\" the organization argues.</p><p>Fix data stranglehold by loosening the platform trap.</p><p>INMA feels tech giants should allow publishers to conduct monetary transactions through their own software without forcing them to use the platform's offerings. Those platforms, INMA argues, should also stop the \"platform trap\" by sending readers directly to publications' websites when they click articles from such publications on social media. \"Apple News at present holds the reader in an Apple bubble with the publisher oblivious to content usage behaviours within that cone of silence,\" INMA argues. \"But those behaviours would be vital input for publishers to help optimize their digital experience for users.\"</p><p>News in the era of big tech</p><p>A Star series is examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.
