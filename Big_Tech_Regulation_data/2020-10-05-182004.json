Sensors everywhere would capture data on everything from park bench usage to air quality, aimed at making the neighborhood more livable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was handshakes and smiles all around when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered here 18 months ago to announce the data-driven city of tomorrow. But internal discord and public criticism now are threatening the project.</p><p>\"I don't think they look so happy now,\" said Paula Fletcher, a Toronto city councilor. \"This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.\"</p><p>As in New York, where fierce opposition to Amazon led the online retail giant to cancel plans to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, a local movement here is growing to send Sidewalk Labs packing. Their concerns: Money, privacy, and whether Toronto is handing too much power over civic life to a for-profit American tech giant.</p><p>The #BlockSidewalk campaign formed in February after the Toronto Star reported on leaked documents indicating that Sidewalk Labs was considering paying for transit and infrastructure on a larger portion of the waterfront. In return, it would seek a cut of the property taxes, development fees and the increased value of the land resulting from the development - an estimated $6 billion over 30 years.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, said it hadn't shared the proposal because it was still being debated. But it was a tough look for a company that has come under fire for a lack of transparency around its business model, and the question of who would own and govern the data and intellectual property at the heart of its proposal.</p><p>\"It's our job to remind everybody that 'no' is an option and that consent is important,\" said Bianca Wylie, one of the leaders of #BlockSidewalk. \"The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.\"</p><p>Separately, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing the city, provincial and federal governments to shut down the project over privacy concerns. The head of the group said Trudeau had been \"seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.\"</p><p>Sidewalk Labs committed $50 million to conducting year-long public consultations and creating a master plan to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, a corporation that represents the three levels of government in developing the area. The plan would require the approval of the corporation and several government bodies to advance.</p><p>The plan is expected by the end of June - more than six months behind schedule.</p><p>The company has acknowledged missteps.</p><p>Micah Lasher, the head of policy and communications for Sidewalk Labs, said providing more details about the business model for Quayside and plans for data governance earlier on would have helped allay many concerns. But he also said the business model remains uncertain.</p><p>Lasher said the company has struggled to figure out when to unveil ideas to the public.</p><p>\"If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,\" he said. \"If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.\"</p><p>Long before the #BlockSidewalk movement and the civil liberties lawsuit, a series of controversies had already provoked public skepticism.</p><p>Some disillusionment stemmed from the flurry of coverage about how tech firms, Google included, handle their customers' personal data.</p><p>Sidewalk has downplayed its links to its corporate sibling, saying it won't monetize the data it collects and proposing that it be governed by a data trust that would set the rules around its use.</p><p>Andrew Clement, a professor emeritus in the University of Toronto's faculty of information studies and member of a Waterfront Toronto advisory panel, said questions remain about the trust. Instead of answering them, he added, Sidewalk has been distracting people with new prototypes, such as raincoats for buildings.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk were both rocked by several high-profile resignations and dismissals last year. Ontario's former privacy commissioner resigned from a paid consulting role with Sidewalk because she said its plans for the data trust fell short of her standards.</p><p>Then, in December, Ontario's auditor general found that Waterfront Toronto gave Sidewalk preferential treatment in selecting it as its partner for Quayside, and called for greater government oversight.</p><p>Wylie, the #BlockSidewalk leader, says cities are relinquishing too much power to big tech companies at a time when regulators are trying to rein them in.</p><p>But some worry that showing Alphabet the door would stain the tech-friendly image that Trudeau has tried to cultivate for Canada.</p><p>\"We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,\" Brian Kelcey, the vice president of public affairs for the Toronto Region Board of Trade, told a parliamentary committee last month.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:foreign@washpost.com\">foreign@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-e07855006d1211e9bbe71c798fb80536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W24-1WW1-DXKP-J07Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 5, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This was followed by Saskatchewan. They are now the only two provinces to force online digital platforms to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"Why would you not impose a tax on Netflix, but you would impose a tax on Bell and Rogers?\" asks Leitao. \"The biggest thing about this, and I don't want to sound too dramatic, was that at the end of the day, there was nothing to fear but fear itself. All we had to do was ask.\"</p><p>The implementation was spectacularly successful: Quebec estimated it would receive $28 million annually after the tax came into effect Jan. 1. By the end of August, they had already raised $38 million. That money will go into the province's general revenue fund where it could be used for any number of things, including education, or infrastructure or security.</p><p>\"We were surprised at the number and at the speed at which suppliers complied with regulations,\" said Leitao. \"It really all worked out rather well.\"</p><p>So if it worked for Quebec, why hasn't the federal government followed suit?</p><p>Under current tax laws created before the digital era, companies that don't have a \"substantial physical presence\" in Canada aren't required to collect sales taxes. Domestic companies have to, creating an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"You already have an unfair advantage between a foreign company and a local one of 15 per cent in Quebec (5 per cent GST and 10 per cent QST) which is huge,\" said Leitao. \"So it's no surprise that Canadian companies aren't happy with that situation.\"</p><p>According to Canada's auditor general, the federal government lost $169 million in sales taxes (GST) alone in 2017 based on foreign digital products and services sold. That amount would likely be higher today given the increasing trend to digital services.</p><p>The issue will only get bigger. Apple TV+ recently launched in Canada and Disney+ launches next week, joining a crowded field of streaming platforms.</p><p>\"Godzilla has landed on our shores and the government still hasn't done anything about it,\" said Howard Law, director of the media sector for Unifor, the division of the union representing workers in the newspaper and broadcasting industries, including Toronto Star workers. \"You've essentially got Netflix 2 and Netflix 3 testing the waters, so now is the time.\"</p><p>After a hands-off approach to big tech, the Liberal government has become much tougher on taxing and regulating the industry over the last year. Public sentiment also shifted dramatically as opinion polls show more Canadians favour regulation and are distrustful of big tech.</p><p>Trudeau promised to follow France's lead by implementing a 3 per cent tax on the revenues of big technology firms ensuring \"multinational tech giants pay tax on the revenue they generate in Canada.\"</p><p>And in an exclusive interview, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told the Star he intends to make sure there are \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms contributing to Canadian culture.</p><p>Unifor's Law says if the government were serious, it could act on this quickly with an order-in-council to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications (CRTC) board overseeing the Broadcasting Act. They could require foreign platforms to spend money on Canadian content, similar to domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"I think the Liberal government has gotten over the fear of being slagged politically for putting on a Netflix tax. Now they've got to follow through,\" says Law.</p><p>What makes it all the more baffling to some critics is why the government doesn't simply tackle the low-hanging fruit of ensuring that everyone, including foreign companies, collect sales tax as Canadian companies are already forced to do. It's a policy that would be far easier to implement since it is simply enforcing the law equally for all businesses.</p><p>\"Taxes are a tough sell. I think across Canada there is this almost visceral reaction to taxes. Take the GST, after all these years people still don't like it,\" said Leitao. \"But really, this is about equity between local and foreign suppliers.\"</p><p>The Liberals, however, did say they would work to \"ensure digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada, collect and remit the same level of sales taxes as Canadian digital corporations,\" but this wasn't included in their fiscal plan or costed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office, according to lobby group Canadians for Tax Fairness.</p><p>Whether the Liberals will move in this direction is another issue, given their minority mandate. But their natural allies, including the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens have already said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and foreign multinationals must pay their fair share.</p><p>Still, the leadership on the Netflix tax means Quebec has given Canadians a model to work with, say economists.</p><p>\"What Quebec did was exactly the right thing,\" said tax expert Jack Mintz, president's fellow in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. \"They took the bull by the horns and went with it. Now that we know the Quebec experience, the federal government should go ahead. It was totally appropriate, an additional source of revenue for the government and exactly the right thing to do from a tax policy perspective.\"</p><p>Netflix has already said it would comply with collecting taxes if required to by the Canadian government. It just hasn't been asked.</p><p>But the question is so sensitive that platforms are reluctant to give details of their operations.</p><p>Netflix, for example, will not reveal if it currently has an office in Canada. Instead, \"confirming we have no comment\" when asked basic questions such as if it had an office, where it might be, or how many employees it may have.</p><p>Still, it remains invested. This week (Nov. 5) they announced a partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival, a three-year investment to invest in emerging talent.</p><p>Netflix also said it had surpassed $500 million in production in Canada, only two years after it established its first presence here. The company had promised to invest at least that amount over five years.</p><p>\"These significant investments made by Netflix in Canada demonstrate that Netflix is in Canada for the long-haul and committed to working with Canadian producers, creators, talent and crews to create more great content,\" said the company in a statement.</p><p>Canada is the fifth most important market for Netflix with an estimated 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenue annually, according to U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. Just the GST alone would be $47 million based on those figures, not including provincial sales taxes.</p><p>\"It is a lot of money when you consider that it is not just Netflix, but other major platforms that are coming to Canada, and this is becoming a bigger issue,\" says Leitao.</p><p>When Leitao's Liberal government set out to implement the tax in late 2016, it was sparked by lobbying from vested interests such as Quebec's Vid&amp;#233;otron cable company and other broadcasters who said they were at a tax disadvantage. Consumers have to pay GST and PST on cable services and for online Canadian platforms such as Bell Media's Crave, but not for foreign digital platforms.</p><p>There was also fear by politicians that the big digital companies wouldn't play ball if they were asked. And there was the perception that there would be pushback from consumers. But none of this happened, as the government framed the tax collection as one of national importance.</p><p>\"It was not just a problem of more taxes, when you think of it, it is a cultural issue and a nationalistic one,\" says Leitao. \"It is the fundamental question of why we are treating our local companies, not equally, but worse than the foreign companies. And that is what we told the people of Quebec.\"</p><p>The biggest hurdle it turned out, was not the voters, or Neflix or Amazon or other suppliers. But convincing Quebec's bureaucracy in the Revenue Ministry (which reports to the Finance Minister) that this would actually work.</p><p>\"There was certainly a great deal of uneasiness. There was talk that this was going to be too difficult. That the companies will find all kinds of ways not to comply,\" says Leitao. \"So I think, in the beginning, there was a real reluctance to explore the possibility of doing so.\"</p><p>A turning point for Leitao was in 2017, when he visited Paris to talk to the OECD on how they were tackling the issue of taxing digital platforms. The European Union has been at the forefront in updating legislation to deal with the digital era.</p><p>\"We realized that we had to put in a more simplified system for companies that didn't have a physical presence in Canada,\" says Leitao. \"Although it was all a lot easier said than done.\"</p><p>But Leitao knew he had a win when later that year Quebec encountered little pushback from digital platforms after unveiling their plan.</p><p>\"They knew they weren't being levied a new tax, they were simply collecting the tax, so they were very wiling to co-operate,\" says Leitao. And the public seemed to be on side, despite the perception initially that this may have been an additional tax.</p><p>The Quebec tax has been such a success, the government is looking at a pilot project to expand the tax to collect QST for online purchases of tangible goods from suppliers located outside Canada.</p><p>\"This is a more complicated project because there are thousands of suppliers,\" says Fanny Beaudry-Campeau, press secretary to Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard. \"If you buy a book from Amazon, if it comes through customs, we should have the QST collected on that.\"</p><p>With the project, the Quebec government has seconded four Revenue Quebec employees on the 12-month experiment with Canada Border Services.</p><p>\"This is certainly something we can see snowballing to other parts of Canada,\" says Beaudry-Campeau. \"We have been taking a hard look at what other countries have been doing. If they can do it, the question is, why can't we?\"</p><p>Leitao, meanwhile, says the second stage of the tax could potentially provide a bigger windfall to Quebec than the Netflix tax.</p><p>\"It's also something that could be a model for the rest of Canada to follow,\" says Leitao.</p><p>As for the Netflix tax, which is now part of his legacy, Leitao says during the early days, he resisted any calls to make the tax one that would go toward any specific group or industry.</p><p>\"The sales tax is a general sales tax and it goes into the general revenue fund. That's the way it should be. And that way it helps all residents. And it will benefit Quebec for years to come.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

This was followed by Saskatchewan. They are now the only two provinces to force online digital platforms to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"Why would you not impose a tax on Netflix, but you would impose a tax on Bell and Rogers?\" asks Leitao. \"The biggest thing about this, and I don't want to sound too dramatic, was that at the end of the day, there was nothing to fear but fear itself. All we had to do was ask.\"</p><p>The implementation was spectacularly successful: Quebec estimated it would receive $28 million annually after the tax came into effect Jan. 1. By the end of August, they had already raised $38 million. That money will go into the province's general revenue fund where it could be used for any number of things, including education, or infrastructure or security.</p><p>\"We were surprised at the number and at the speed at which suppliers complied with regulations,\" said Leitao. \"It really all worked out rather well.\"</p><p>So if it worked for Quebec, why hasn't the federal government followed suit?</p><p>Under current tax laws created before the digital era, companies that don't have a \"substantial physical presence\" in Canada aren't required to collect sales taxes. Domestic companies have to, creating an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"You already have an unfair advantage between a foreign company and a local one of 15 per cent in Quebec (5 per cent GST and 10 per cent QST) which is huge,\" said Leitao. \"So it's no surprise that Canadian companies aren't happy with that situation.\"</p><p>According to Canada's auditor general, the federal government lost $169 million in sales taxes (GST) alone in 2017 based on foreign digital products and services sold. That amount would likely be higher today given the increasing trend to digital services.</p><p>The issue will only get bigger. Apple TV+ recently launched in Canada and Disney+ launches next week, joining a crowded field of streaming platforms.</p><p>\"Godzilla has landed on our shores and the government still hasn't done anything about it,\" said Howard Law, director of the media sector for Unifor, the division of the union representing workers in the newspaper and broadcasting industries, including Toronto Star workers. \"You've essentially got Netflix 2 and Netflix 3 testing the waters, so now is the time.\"</p><p>After a hands-off approach to big tech, the Liberal government has become much tougher on taxing and regulating the industry over the last year. Public sentiment also shifted dramatically as opinion polls show more Canadians favour regulation and are distrustful of big tech.</p><p>Trudeau promised to follow France's lead by implementing a 3 per cent tax on the revenues of big technology firms ensuring \"multinational tech giants pay tax on the revenue they generate in Canada.\"</p><p>And in an exclusive interview, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told the Star he intends to make sure there are \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms contributing to Canadian culture.</p><p>Unifor's Law says if the government were serious, it could act on this quickly with an order-in-council to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications (CRTC) board overseeing the Broadcasting Act. They could require foreign platforms to spend money on Canadian content, similar to domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"I think the Liberal government has gotten over the fear of being slagged politically for putting on a Netflix tax. Now they've got to follow through,\" says Law.</p><p>What makes it all the more baffling to some critics is why the government doesn't simply tackle the low-hanging fruit of ensuring that everyone, including foreign companies, collect sales tax as Canadian companies are already forced to do. It's a policy that would be far easier to implement since it is simply enforcing the law equally for all businesses.</p><p>\"Taxes are a tough sell. I think across Canada there is this almost visceral reaction to taxes. Take the GST, after all these years people still don't like it,\" said Leitao. \"But really, this is about equity between local and foreign suppliers.\"</p><p>The Liberals, however, did say they would work to \"ensure digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada, collect and remit the same level of sales taxes as Canadian digital corporations,\" but this wasn't included in their fiscal plan or costed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office, according to lobby group Canadians for Tax Fairness.</p><p>Whether the Liberals will move in this direction is another issue, given their minority mandate. But their natural allies, including the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens have already said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and foreign multinationals must pay their fair share.</p><p>Still, the leadership on the Netflix tax means Quebec has given Canadians a model to work with, say economists.</p><p>\"What Quebec did was exactly the right thing,\" said tax expert Jack Mintz, president's fellow in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. \"They took the bull by the horns and went with it. Now that we know the Quebec experience, the federal government should go ahead. It was totally appropriate, an additional source of revenue for the government and exactly the right thing to do from a tax policy perspective.\"</p><p>Netflix has already said it would comply with collecting taxes if required to by the Canadian government. It just hasn't been asked.</p><p>But the question is so sensitive that platforms are reluctant to give details of their operations.</p><p>Canada is the fifth most important market for Netflix with an estimated 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenue annually, according to U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. Just the GST alone would be $47 million based on those figures, not including provincial sales taxes.</p><p>\"It is a lot of money when you consider that it is not just Netflix, but other major platforms that are coming to Canada, and this is becoming a bigger issue,\" says Leitao.</p><p>When Leitao's Liberal government set out to implement the tax in late 2016, it was sparked by lobbying from vested interests such as Quebec's Vid&amp;#233;otron cable company and other broadcasters who said they were at a tax disadvantage. Consumers have to pay GST and PST on cable services and for online Canadian platforms such as Bell Media's Crave, but not for foreign digital platforms.</p><p>There was also fear by politicians that the big digital companies wouldn't play ball if they were asked. And there was the perception that there would be pushback from consumers. But none of this happened, as the government framed the tax collection as one of national importance.</p><p>\"It was not just a problem of more taxes, when you think of it, it is a cultural issue and a nationalistic one,\" says Leitao. \"It is the fundamental question of why we are treating our local companies, not equally, but worse than the foreign companies.

This was followed by Saskatchewan. They are now the only two provinces to force online digital platforms to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"Why would you not impose a tax on Netflix, but you would impose a tax on Bell and Rogers?\" asks Leitao. \"The biggest thing about this, and I don't want to sound too dramatic, was that at the end of the day, there was nothing to fear but fear itself. All we had to do was ask.\"</p><p>The implementation was spectacularly successful: Quebec estimated it would receive $28 million annually after the tax came into effect Jan. 1. By the end of August, they had already raised $38 million. That money will go into the province's general revenue fund where it could be used for any number of things, including education, or infrastructure or security.</p><p>\"We were surprised at the number and at the speed at which suppliers complied with regulations,\" said Leitao. \"It really all worked out rather well.\"</p><p>So if it worked for Quebec, why hasn't the federal government followed suit?</p><p>Under current tax laws created before the digital era, companies that don't have a \"substantial physical presence\" in Canada aren't required to collect sales taxes. Domestic companies have to, creating an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"You already have an unfair advantage between a foreign company and a local one of 15 per cent in Quebec (5 per cent GST and 10 per cent QST) which is huge,\" said Leitao. \"So it's no surprise that Canadian companies aren't happy with that situation.\"</p><p>According to the Canada's auditor general, the federal government lost $169 million in sales taxes (GST) alone in 2017 based on foreign digital products and services sold. That amount would likely be higher today given the increasing trend to digital services.</p><p>The issue will only get bigger. Apple TV+ recently launched in Canada and Disney+ launches next week, joining a crowded field of streaming platforms.</p><p>\"Godzilla has landed on our shores and the government still hasn't done anything about it,\" said Howard Law, director of the media sector for Unifor, the division of the union representing workers in the newspaper and broadcasting industries, including Toronto Star workers. \"You've essentially got Netflix 2 and Netflix 3 testing the waters, so now is the time.\"</p><p>After a hands-off approach to big tech, the Liberal government has become much tougher on taxing and regulating the industry over the last year. Public sentiment also shifted dramatically as opinion polls show more Canadians favour regulation and are distrustful of big tech.</p><p>Trudeau promised to follow France's lead by implementing a 3 per cent tax on the revenues of big technology firms ensuring \"multinational tech giants pay tax on the revenue they generate in Canada.\"</p><p>And in an exclusive interview , Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told the Star he intends to make sure there are \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms contributing to Canadian culture.</p><p>Unifor's Law says if the government were serious, it could act on this quickly with an order-in-council to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications (CRTC) board overseeing the Broadcasting Act. They could require foreign platforms to spend money on Canadian content, similar to domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"I think the Liberal government has gotten over the fear of being slagged politically for putting on a Netflix tax. Now they've got to follow through,\" says Law.</p><p>What makes it all the more baffling to some critics is why the government doesn't simply tackle the low-hanging fruit of ensuring that everyone, including foreign companies, collect sales tax as Canadian companies are already forced to do. It's a policy that would be far easier to implement since it is simply enforcing the law equally for all businesses.</p><p>\"Taxes are a tough sell. I think across Canada there is this almost visceral reaction to taxes. Take the GST, after all these years people still don't like it,\" said Leitao. \"But really, this is about equity between local and foreign suppliers.\"</p><p>The Liberals, however, did say they would work to \"ensure digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada, collect and remit the same level of sales taxes as Canadian digital corporations,\" but this wasn't included in their fiscal plan or costed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office, according to lobby group Canadians for Tax Fairness.</p><p>Whether the Liberals will move in this direction is another issue, given their minority mandate. But their natural allies, including the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens have already said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and foreign multinationals must pay their fair share.</p><p>Still, the leadership on the Netflix tax means Quebec has given Canadians a model to work with, say economists.</p><p>\"What Quebec did was exactly the right thing,\" said tax expert Jack Mintz, president's fellow in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. \"They took the bull by the horns and went with it. Now that we know the Quebec experience, the federal government should go ahead. It was totally appropriate, an additional source of revenue for the government and exactly the right thing to do from a tax policy perspective.\"</p><p>Netflix has already said it would comply with collecting taxes if required to by the Canadian government. It just hasn't been asked.</p><p>But the question is so sensitive that platforms are reluctant to give details of their operations.</p><p>Canada is the fifth most important market for Netflix with an estimated 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenue annually, according to U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. Just the GST alone would be $47 million based on those figures, not including provincial sales taxes.</p><p>\"It is a lot of money when you consider that it is not just Netflix, but other major platforms that are coming to Canada, and this is becoming a bigger issue,\" says Leitao.</p><p>When Leitao's Liberal government set out to implement the tax in late 2016, it was sparked by lobbying from vested interests such as Quebec's Vid&amp;#233;otron cable company and other broadcasters who said they were at a tax disadvantage. Consumers have to pay GST and PST on cable services and for online Canadian platforms such as Bell Media's Crave, but not for foreign digital platforms.</p><p>There was also fear by politicians that the big digital companies wouldn't play ball if they were asked. And there was the perception that there would be pushback from consumers. But none of this happened, as the government framed the tax collection as one of national importance.</p><p>\"It was not just a problem of more taxes, when you think of it, it is a cultural issue and a nationalistic one,\" says Leitao. \"It is the fundamental question of why we are treating our local companies, not equally, but worse than the foreign companies. And that is what we told the people of Quebec.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

This was followed by Saskatchewan. They are now the only two provinces to force online digital platforms to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"Why would you not impose a tax on Netflix, but you would impose a tax on Bell and Rogers?\" asks Leitao. \"The biggest thing about this, and I don't want to sound too dramatic, was that at the end of the day, there was nothing to fear but fear itself. All we had to do was ask.\"</p><p>The implementation was spectacularly successful: Quebec estimated it would receive $28 million annually after the tax came into effect Jan. 1. By the end of August, they had already raised $38 million. That money will go into the province's general revenue fund where it could be used for any number of things, including education, or infrastructure or security.</p><p>\"We were surprised at the number and at the speed at which suppliers complied with regulations,\" said Leitao. \"It really all worked out rather well.\"</p><p>So if it worked for Quebec, why hasn't the federal government followed suit?</p><p>Under current tax laws created before the digital era, companies that don't have a \"substantial physical presence\" in Canada aren't required to collect sales taxes. Domestic companies have to, creating an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"You already have an unfair advantage between a foreign company and a local one of 15 per cent in Quebec (5 per cent GST and 10 per cent QST) which is huge,\" said Leitao. \"So it's no surprise that Canadian companies aren't happy with that situation.\"</p><p>According to the Canada's auditor general, the federal government lost $169 million in sales taxes (GST) alone in 2017 based on foreign digital products and services sold. That amount would likely be higher today given the increasing trend to digital services.</p><p>The issue will only get bigger. Apple TV+ recently launched in Canada and Disney+ launches next week, joining a crowded field of streaming platforms.</p><p>\"Godzilla has landed on our shores and the government still hasn't done anything about it,\" said Howard Law, director of the media sector for Unifor, the division of the union representing workers in the newspaper and broadcasting industries, including Toronto Star workers. \"You've essentially got Netflix 2 and Netflix 3 testing the waters, so now is the time.\"</p><p>After a hands-off approach to big tech, the Liberal government has become much tougher on taxing and regulating the industry over the last year. Public sentiment also shifted dramatically as opinion polls show more Canadians favour regulation and are distrustful of big tech.</p><p>Trudeau promised to follow France's lead by implementing a 3 per cent tax on the revenues of big technology firms ensuring \"multinational tech giants pay tax on the revenue they generate in Canada.\"</p><p>And in an exclusive interview , Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told the Star he intends to make sure there are \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms contributing to Canadian culture.</p><p>Unifor's Law says if the government were serious, it could act on this quickly with an order-in-council to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications (CRTC) board overseeing the Broadcasting Act. They could require foreign platforms to spend money on Canadian content, similar to domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"I think the Liberal government has gotten over the fear of being slagged politically for putting on a Netflix tax. Now they've got to follow through,\" says Law.</p><p>What makes it all the more baffling to some critics is why the government doesn't simply tackle the low-hanging fruit of ensuring that everyone, including foreign companies, collect sales tax as Canadian companies are already forced to do. It's a policy that would be far easier to implement since it is simply enforcing the law equally for all businesses.</p><p>\"Taxes are a tough sell. I think across Canada there is this almost visceral reaction to taxes. Take the GST, after all these years people still don't like it,\" said Leitao. \"But really, this is about equity between local and foreign suppliers.\"</p><p>The Liberals, however, did say they would work to \"ensure digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada, collect and remit the same level of sales taxes as Canadian digital corporations,\" but this wasn't included in their fiscal plan or costed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office, according to lobby group Canadians for Tax Fairness.</p><p>Whether the Liberals will move in this direction is another issue, given their minority mandate. But their natural allies, including the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens have already said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and foreign multinationals must pay their fair share.</p><p>Still, the leadership on the Netflix tax means Quebec has given Canadians a model to work with, say economists.</p><p>\"What Quebec did was exactly the right thing,\" said tax expert Jack Mintz, president's fellow in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. \"They took the bull by the horns and went with it. Now that we know the Quebec experience, the federal government should go ahead. It was totally appropriate, an additional source of revenue for the government and exactly the right thing to do from a tax policy perspective.\"</p><p>Netflix has already said it would comply with collecting taxes if required to by the Canadian government. It just hasn't been asked.</p><p>But the question is so sensitive that platforms are reluctant to give details of their operations.</p><p>Canada is the fifth most important market for Netflix with an estimated 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenue annually, according to U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. Just the GST alone would be $47 million based on those figures, not including provincial sales taxes.</p><p>\"It is a lot of money when you consider that it is not just Netflix, but other major platforms that are coming to Canada, and this is becoming a bigger issue,\" says Leitao.</p><p>When Leitao's Liberal government set out to implement the tax in late 2016, it was sparked by lobbying from vested interests such as Quebec's Vid&amp;#233;otron cable company and other broadcasters who said they were at a tax disadvantage. Consumers have to pay GST and PST on cable services and for online Canadian platforms such as Bell Media's Crave, but not for foreign digital platforms.</p><p>There was also fear by politicians that the big digital companies wouldn't play ball if they were asked. And there was the perception that there would be pushback from consumers. But none of this happened, as the government framed the tax collection as one of national importance.</p><p>\"It was not just a problem of more taxes, when you think of it, it is a cultural issue and a nationalistic one,\" says Leitao. \"It is the fundamental question of why we are treating our local companies, not equally, but worse than the foreign companies. And that is what we told the people of Quebec.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm Richard Quest. Julia is off today and here's what you need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crucial week as the Queen delivers the U.K. government's speech. Britain wants to see and waits to see if a Brexit deal can be delivered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On trade, a done deal. Futures are falling amid fears a China trade deal is far from sewn up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Libra, it remains in the lurch. Cracks in the digital currency coalition.</p><p>Put it all together. It's Monday and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p>A very good day to you. Welcome. This is FIRST MOVE as we start a new week. Glad to have you with us. The markets, we need to take attention to. Futures are pointing to a lower Wall Street open with reports saying China wants a fresh round of talks before signing the first phase of the U.S.-China Trade Deal. That would be a major difference of opinion.</p><p>The Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says today work still needs to be done on the deal. Exactly how far it is holding together is not very clear.</p><p>Mnuchin is stressing the two sides have a fundamental agreement in place. But what is that agreement and will it holds water? The President calls the deal very substantial on Friday.</p><p>Morgan Stanley calls it an uncertain arrangement. It says new tariff hikes cannot be ruled out. Whilst China has released a weak import and export numbers that is evidence the trade conflict is hitting the Chinese particularly hard.</p><p>However, optimism on trade helped propel stocks higher last week. All the major averages rose above one percent on Friday. The Dow and the S&amp;P finished the week higher and that's the first weekly rise so far this month.</p><p>Now, to the earnings season. Third quarter earnings begin to take center stage on Wall Street as wind our way through Monday with the major banks beginning to report their earnings on Tuesday.</p><p>Brexit negotiations also drive sentiment. The pounds is lower, just a tad or so after its best week of gains in some three years, looking at 1.2563 and there is of course the Brussels Summit, the European Council in Brussels, that is going to be where all attention is paid.</p><p>So to Brexit and what actually happened in the U.K. today. Today's drivers.</p><p>In London the Queen has opened Parliament. It was a speech that outlined U.K. government's policy agenda and at its heart is this promise from her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN: My government's priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union on the 31st of October. My government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union based on free trade and friendly cooperation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Two weeks to go before the October 31st deadline. Nic Robertson is with me at Westminster. Nic, together, we heard what the Queen has had to say. It's a domestic agenda. But it really doesn't mask the fact that Brexit, this week's Summit is going to be the key event.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, I mean, there's a lot of pomp and circumstance and an important message, of course for the government. But the reality is that the real political football is now being played out in Brussels in those very secret negotiations -- technical negotiators there have been with British negotiators and the European Union negotiators headed by Michelle Barnier.</p><p>Barnier -- when he briefed the E.U. ambassadors over the weekend clearly indicated that it is still a tough negotiation process; that it is still not within sight that there's a deal. Both sides have said that there's an aspiration that they will get a deal.</p><p>But the stumbling block over Northern Ireland being in the European Customs Union or in the United Kingdom Customs Union or some variant between still seems to be the tough issue that's open for negotiation.</p><p>So not clear come Wednesday, whether the British Prime Minister will have the bones of a semblance of a structure of a deal to have the E.U. leaders at their Summit at the end of the week signed off on and then for him to bring back here -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: But no deal, is it off the table bearing in mind -- I know I've been banging on about this for hours just today -- is it off the table bearing in mind the Benn Act will require an extension from the Prime Minister if no deal has been arranged?</p><p>[09:05:10]</p><p>ROBERTSON: There is an understanding among some MPs in the Conservative Party that there are a number of ways and we heard one MP -- a Conservative MP -- outlining that there were three ways when he was speaking with you earlier, but that he wouldn't articulate those three avenues open to frustrate the Benn Act and even dodge around it.</p><p>He said, because obviously the Conservatives' political opponents would then seize upon those details, they'll find a way to shut it down.</p><p>So there does seem to be an understanding that there is a way to avoid going back -- for Boris Johnson to avoid going back to the European Union and asking for a three-month extension whether or not those avenues will be frustrated isn't clear, and they certainly would appear from our understanding at the moment to be against the law, but he has said this he will abide by the law.</p><p>We just don't know how Boris Johnson and his party, if they so choose, will decide to frustrate it.</p><p>QUEST: And the U.K. election when?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Sorry, Richard, I didn't hear you. Say that again, please?</p><p>QUEST: I do beg your pardon. A U.K. election - when is that likely?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Before Christmas, that seems to be the best expectation at the moment. Quite simply, if the Benn Act is acted upon and the extension -- the Prime Minister gets the extension, that's really believed to be the threshold, the trigger for the Labour Party to follow through a call for a vote of no confidence in the government which would trigger an election.</p><p>The Prime Minister has been asking for it. The Labour Party has been shirking it, saying it wants to make sure that that extension is enshrined.</p><p>So before Christmas is the expectation and to that point, much of what we heard in the Queen's speech today, the social agenda, the security agenda that was laid out by the Queen for the Prime Minister. That's really what the Prime Minister will be campaigning on.</p><p>QUEST: Nic Robertson. Nic Robertson in Westminster. Thank you.</p><p>The words candid, effective and constructive. Those are the ones being used by China to describe the latest trade talks with the United States. Asian markets were higher, there are however reports that suggests China wants more clarity before signing on.</p><p>After President Trump touted phase one, here is what the U.S. Treasury Steve Mnuchin said earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I wouldn't pay too much attention to all the daily headlines that speculate things one way or another. What I will tell you is we made substantial progress last week in the negotiations.</p><p>We have a fundamental agreement that is subject to documentation and there's a lot of work to be done on that front, but it includes intellectual property rights, and it includes financial services. It includes currency and foreign exchange, and it also includes very significant structural issues in agriculture.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: David Culver joins me from Shenzhen in China. What is the -- what are the Chinese waiting for? This idea that somehow they will delay signing this until there is progress on the next phase? What's actually being said?</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think as of now, Richard, the sense of uncertainty that surrounds anything that as of this point has to do with the Trump administration. From China's perspective, it's not that they don't see this as a positive impact. They characterize this likewise as substantial progress.</p><p>Interesting to note, they don't say what President Trump says, as a very substantial phase one deal. They don't use that word - deal. They call it progress.</p><p>And they know from past dealings that things can change very quickly with this administration. So it's a cautious optimism that they're going into this one with.</p><p>But they also need this deal to come through. So this is not just the U.S. that would be benefiting from this. The economy here has been taken a hit.</p><p>We've been talking to folks who are reluctant to make big consumer purchases. When you look at the pork crisis, that's been huge and really decimated a third of China's pork, the main staple meat here.</p><p>And so they're going to benefit from this surge of imports of $40 billion to $50 billion as President Trump has characterized it as much perhaps as the U.S. would.</p><p>QUEST: And if you look at what the commentators are saying, does this deal at least start to pry open the Chinese economy in the way the U.S. has said, or is it really just a buy some more, you know, fiddle around with the currency a bit, buy some more agriculture, keep the Americans happy?</p><p>CULVER: I think as of now, they're looking at this from the China perspective, as certainly a positive. They do see this as leading to potential progress, but they don't characterize it nearly as positively as President Trump has come out to say it.</p><p>In fact, we took the claim that President Trump put out on Twitter saying that the agricultural purchases have started already, are currently underway.</p><p>[09:10:07]</p><p>CULVER: And we brought that to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We wanted to get official comment on that. They wouldn't even go there. They deferred it to the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department not even addressing it.</p><p>So they want to keep this for now, still back channeled, still out of the headlines. They've seen things fall apart in the past. And so what makes this deal different? That was a question that was posed to President Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, and if you listen to the roll of that conversation, I sat through that 30-minute conversation listening to the back and forth, and it was U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, along with Secretary Mnuchin, who weighed in saying that this one is different because of the structure and the framework that is in place.</p><p>They have in their mind dispute settlements that will allow some of the smaller details that cannot be agreed upon going into this to then be discussed at lower levels to be figured out, solved before having to rise all the way up to the Ministerial level and further delay this progress.</p><p>So that's what they characterize as being different from past deals and negotiations, and hence being a positive going into this. But the timeline here still remains uncertain, Richard. We're talking three, four or five weeks. Those are the President's words.</p><p>He says maybe it will happen in Chile when he meets with President Xi Jinping for the APEC summit. That's possible given that's kind of neutral ground. It's neither of their countries and it perhaps would be the best backdrop for this.</p><p>QUEST: David Culver in Shenzhen in China. Thank you, sir. Now, Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra is in the balance as the tech giant meets with backers on Monday. The Head of the Global Financial Stability Board is warning of a host of challenges posed by the digital coin.</p><p>Major payment companies like MasterCard and Visa have withdrawn their support. Clare Sebastian is with me. It was always going to be difficult, but why are they all jumping ship?</p><p>As far as I can see, there's no new problems. It's only the same problems that have become crystal clear.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The same problems, but those same problem, Richard are mounting and that is the regulatory scrutiny that this project is facing.</p><p>It's, you know, been -- there was a joint team back in September from France and Germany saying they wanted to block it. The House Financial Services Committee wants to hold hearings. The Federal Reserve is looking into it.</p><p>And then we get this letter from Randal Quarles, he is head of the Financial Stability Board - that international body that monitors the financial system, talking about a host of challenges and then they're looking into the need to fill regulatory gaps.</p><p>So Visa, MasterCard, eBay, Stripe, pretty much all the big payment companies that had partnered or has expressed an interest in partnering with Facebook on this are out. Visa said that they are -- they're still evaluating this, but they're looking at a number of factors, including the association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.</p><p>So clearly, the regulator issues are playing a role in this, but Libra -- Calibra remains, Richard defiant and they're pushing ahead with this.</p><p>QUEST: Clare, but surely, these issues -- regulatory issues -- they will always going to be there. I mean, it does strike me that these other companies -- I mean, what did they think was going to happen when they signed on?</p><p>Their experts told them what the regulatory issues were going to be, and they've -- and those issues have arrived and need to be solved? Doesn't it seem a bit weird just to be jumping ship because the goings got tough?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I mean, I think, certainly, Richard, you could have seen this coming, and Facebook said when they launched the white paper for this project back in June that you know, we're not ready for launch yet. There's still a lot of things to be worked out. We're doing this early because we want to start the conversation and have it publicly.</p><p>I think, to an extent that has backfired because we are also in this moment, Richard, whether this backlash against these big tech companies, but this is -- these companies pulling out, Richard, is a big setback for Facebook because of the uphill climb they face when building trust towards this project.</p><p>The answer that they've constantly given, as they've been questioned on why people should trust their financial information to a company that has such a patchy track record when it comes to handling user data is that they're not just trusting Facebook. They are trusting this coalition of all of these other partners that are going into this meeting today, Richard, where they're supposed to be finalizing some of the early members of the Libra Association, really kind of on the back foot, at least in how this project is being perceived.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian, keep watching. And as that meeting progresses, come back and report more for us -- to us about it.</p><p>Now to the stories that are making headlines around the world.</p><p>The U.S. President's top former Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, is set to testify on Capitol Hill. She is arriving for her testimony. She did just a few moments ago and the first of a number of witnesses to appear this week, including Gordon Sondland, the Ambassador to the E.U.</p><p>It's his text messages about Ukraine that are central to the Democrats' Impeachment Inquiry. Suzanne Malveaux is in Washington. Are they just going around the same areas about who said what, where, when, why over these texts and the President's Ukraine conversation or is this now starting to widen out to other areas that will be crucial?</p><p>[09:15:03]</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's one window that is going to be crucial here and that is the window of time between the text message in which one of the U.S. diplomat said, I think this is crazy that you've got this exchange, if you will, for the aid going to Ukraine and this delay and linking that to a political favor, and then you had Sondland jump in, but five hours later saying, no, no, no, no, no quid pro quo here.</p><p>What happened in that time period? Who actually had conversations about how that was actually framed? And so that's one of the new areas. But you bring up a very good point, Richard, which is they're also just going through some of the same material that they already have to kind of flesh this out and give it larger context.</p><p>So when you look at somebody like Fiona Hill, who was the Russian adviser at the National Security Council, she actually left her post a week before President Trump's critical phone call with the Ukrainian President, and then she left the administration altogether in August.</p><p>So she is very able to speak freely and has no constraints whatsoever when she goes before the Committees here, and they're very excited about that possibility.</p><p>But what Democrats want to know, is, during that period during that process, what would have been the impact, say, of withholding military aid to Ukraine given that Ukraine is in a proxy war with Russia. Who was part of that decision making process to come to that conclusion or to try to do that? Was it President Trump or was it some of these backdoor shadowy figures if you will, like Rudy Giuliani, for instance? Yes, go ahead.</p><p>QUEST: Suzanne Malveaux on Capitol Hill. Suzanne, thank you.</p><p>The Spanish Supreme Court has just handed prison sentences to nine Catalan independence leaders, including the former Vice President for Catalonia. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for sedition and embezzlement of public funds.</p><p>The former head of the Catalan regional government, Carles Puigdemont has called a sentence as an outrage.</p><p>A U.N. representative says the Ecuadorian government and indigenous groups who led anti-austerity protests have reached an agreement last night -- on Sunday night.</p><p>The government is repealing a decree that ended fuel subsidies, a measure the sparked more than 10 days of protests.</p><p>And as we continue on FIRST MOVE, the Queen opens a new session of Parliament and the British Prime Minister starts a new week of fresh hope for a Brexit deal.</p><p>And there's another deal in the works, the U.S. and China trade talks. The phase one has been done. We need to understand what's at stake. In a moment.</p><p>[09:20:46]</p><p>QUEST: FIRST MOVE today comes to you from London. I'm Richard Quest, in for Julia.</p><p>The U.S. futures are lower and European stocks are falling, and there are a whole host of reasons why. But if you do take a look, you've got the FTSE and the DAX and the CAC all lower by roughly the same amount, half a percent.</p><p>And similarly if you look at the U.S. futures, both the narrow market through the Dow, the broader market through the S&amp;P and the tech through the NASDAQ, again, they are down and they're down by a similar amount to each other as well.</p><p>So there's a lot of commonality on losses, which suggests the same reasons are affecting all, and it's all about trade uncertainty. The reports say China wants new talks before signing any trade deal.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said today he is confident that a deal will be finalized. But the three-session winning streak is on the line. The Dow and the S&amp;P are still down slightly for October. The worst start to an October in a decade.</p><p>And the U.S. bond market is closed today, of course. It's Columbus Day, a holiday. So there's not much trading going on generally.</p><p>Scott Wren is with me, the Senior Global Equity Strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p><p>Before we get into -- before we get hands dirty with the nitty-gritty of what's going on, where do you stand on this October run for the hills? It's always horrible in October.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Well, I think Richard, really, if you look back in time, October on average, if you look from 1950s, about the middle of the pack of about a point nine percent gains, so we're not as fearful of October as a lot of the media is and a lot of our investors are. We always get tons of questions.</p><p>But in the end, and this October, you know, we think the market, the S&amp;P 500 is going to finish the year a couple of percent higher than where it is now. So we're not we're not sweating October right now.</p><p>QUEST: Will we make a trade deal? I mean, is it just a rag bag of things, just to keep everybody happy? Or do you see some real opportunities within phase one?</p><p>WREN: Well, for us, anyway, you know, we don't think that the market needs you know, much of a trade deal at all. I mean, something that would promise not to put more tariffs on, hopefully take some tariffs off, and I think the market would be fine with that and I think that's what the S&amp;P 500, what the market is anticipating right now. And we think that's the correct thing.</p><p>Although, for us, you know, we think that the solid deal, the on-paper signed deal, probably out into 2020. So I think that the talk that we had on Friday, you know, you could see where the market sold off, going into the close from the highs.</p><p>And I think part of that was because we didn't know what was going to come out over the weekend. The press conference wasn't really finished.</p><p>And so I think there is more work to do that makes sense, as the President said, we're trying to get some things on paper here. So I think we're going to see a little bit of up and down here. It's probably going to cause some more volatility day-to-day in the stock market.</p><p>But clearly, you know, the futures aren't down very much here before the open and I think the market is convinced we're going to get some kind of deal at some point.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but what if some kind of deal at some point so much of the next direction of interest rates from the Fed depends on answering that previous question, doesn't it? Because if you remember, what the Minutes said, and what Jay Paul said in his testimony, never have I seen a Fed so concerned about a trade deal.</p><p>So where do you see the next -- I mean, what do you see as the Feds move next?</p><p>WREN: Well, I think you know, as far as the Fed goes, our call, we expect one more cut this year. We expect another cut next year. So we do think there is going to be another cut. And I think the Fed is paying attention to that because of this international economy.</p><p>And let's face it, the S&amp;P 500 gets 40 percent of the revenues almost from outside the country. So you know, we need these outside countries. We need to know what's going on there and have a good feel for that.</p><p>And so, these trade frictions have caused a lot of headwinds. I mean, you look at earnings from -- China had decent earnings but big exporters into China like South Korea and Taiwan, their earnings have been terrible in the last two or three quarters, and it's mainly due to the uncertainty over this trade situation.</p><p>[09:25:08]</p><p>QUEST: Now, let's talk about that because you talk about the earnings and the spillover effect. If we start looking at Japan, Hong Kong -- well, not so much Hong Kong -- but Japan, Singapore, all the other ASEAN countries that are feeling the effects of a slowing China economy. Are they about to get clobbered or helped?</p><p>WREN: Well, if, you know, they are definitely going to be negatively affected. And as I said, you know, I mentioned South Korea and Taiwan got their -- you know, their earnings were down 30, 40, 50 percent.</p><p>And so I think any of these economies that export into China and in general export around the world because let's face it, world trade growth is down. The volume is down a little this year, they're going to be hurt. And so that's something that we need to think of. That's something that Federal Reserve is thinking of. And I think that's going to play into their decision.</p><p>QUEST: Great to have you Scott, as always. Thank you so much for giving us a sense of what's happening in the markets. It's much appreciated. I appreciate it. Particularly of course, as we talk about Asia and of course -- where of course, now it is coming up too late in the evening at 9:30 at night, if you're watching us in Asia.</p><p>We will have the opening bell for you in a moment. Interesting day, interesting week ahead. It is going to be about trade. That's going to be the sort of driving factor.</p><p>With the markets down, they will be looking for an element of optimism. The fresh week starts. The trading begins with the opening bell on Wall Street, in just -- I don't know? Three minutes from now.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>QUEST: And we are off to the races. The opening bell has rung and trading begins on the New York Stock Exchange and all the major markets in New York. Europe is open. The U.S. is open and we are looking at a lower open on Wall Street that will kick off the trading week.</p><p>It is trade uncertainties. It's the usual things. But there are some new elements even after Friday's agreement between China and the U.S. There's reports about whether China wants more talk before signing.</p><p>But let's -- the new element that's going to come onto the table this week are earnings and we start off tomorrow with U.S. financial giants. We're always going to get numbers from Netflix, IBM, some big names and that's crucial because that gives us direction.</p><p>Then we start to find out how much of this market is predicated on strong earnings versus trade, and the bond market is closed today, so trading is likely to be subdued. You'll often see that subdued in that, and in foreign exchange, certainly in terms of with the bond market close.</p><p>At Westminster, the British Parliament has resumed business. Within the hour, the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will begin the debate on the Queen's speech that reopened Parliament a short while ago.</p><p>And in it, the Prime Minister unveiled his policy. Carole Walker is with us who is our eye of course on U.K. politics. It was a very domestic speech, but what did we learn? What was new about what Boris Johnson through the Queen told us?</p><p>CAROLE WALKER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, essentially this was the Prime Minister setting out his priorities through the guilt-crusted ceremony of the state opening of Parliament.</p><p>So the opening statement of the speech which was read out by Her Majesty was that the government's priority was to take the U.K. out of the European Union on March 31st and to develop a new partnership based on free trade and friendly cooperation. An awful lot of what we saw in a total of 26 bills did relate to the Brexit process.</p><p>So we're going to have a withdrawal agreement bill, of course, we haven't gotten a withdrawal agreement yet. There's going to be new bills to govern our fisheries, our agriculture, and a new immigration system post-Brexit, but of course, so much hinging on those talks still going on inside the E.U.</p><p>The other thing that Boris Johnson was really trying to do here was to reach out to voters in an election which is going to be with us within weeks saying, look, if we can just get Brexit done, we're going to put lots more money into your schools, into your hospitals. We are getting much tougher on violent criminals, a very strong law and order slanted speech.</p><p>QUEST: Carole, is it likely that you'll get it through Parliament? It might be meaningless in terms of the great -- the greater picture -- but the inability to get a Queen's speech passed by Parliament is usually equivalent to a vote of no confidence.</p><p>WALKER: Well, Richard, it is certainly very doubtful that he will get this Queen's speech through Parliament. We have five days of debate going on, at the same time as those crucial negotiations over Brexit continuing in Brussels.</p><p>And at the end of that, there does have to be a vote in the comments on the Queen's speech, which sets out the government's program, what it wants to achieve in power.</p><p>Normally, as you say, if that was to be voted down, that would be a case for the Prime Minister to resign and we'd have a general election, but we know that bizarrely at the moment, we have a government that actually wants to have a general election and an opposition is not prepared to allow him to do that, until he has requested a delay to that Brexit deadline due on October 31st.</p><p>And I should say, after all the pomp and ceremony and dignity this morning now that Her Majesty has moved on, the demonstrators are back with us down here -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I know. It was quite peaceful. All we had this morning outside there was the Welsh Guards. Now, you've got the protesters back -- not as melodic as the band of the Welsh Guards.</p><p>Carole, finally, briefly, does the -- is there a feeling that this is all just going in circles? That what's actually happening in the chamber doesn't really matter because until there is fresh meat from Brussels for everybody to chew on, it's just trying -- to mix the metaphors -- treading water.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>WALKER: There is a somewhat unreal air to the proceedings today, Richard. Normally we have a Queen's speech after a new government has been elected. We are now having one within what is likely to be weeks, if not perhaps a few months until we get to a general election.</p><p>And there's almost no one here at Westminster who thinks that much of this law that was announced today is actually going to become legally binding; actually, be taken through Parliament before that general election.</p><p>So we'll see the real politics resume when the Prime Minister gets on his feet in the next half an hour or so. But he's going to use this opportunity to make political points you can be sure at the same time as he knows that so much now depends on whether he can get a deal in Brussels.</p><p>QUEST: Carole, good to see you. Thank you. As always. Investors are watching U.S.-China trade talks. Beijing, according some reports, wants more clarity before signing a deal. It follows President Trump touting a substantial phase one agreement.</p><p>The Chinese Vice Premier has described negotiations as candid, effective, and constructive. Ambassador Carla Hills is with me, former U.S. Trade Representative and certainly knows around these waters.</p><p>Ambassador, what do you make of this deal? Is it just a cobble together or are there real structural improvements within it that are worth it?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: There are no structural improvements. It's the first step in continued negotiations, and we were all upset when in May the discussions fell apart. So we should smile that they're back together again.</p><p>But really all we've talked about and that's on the table is China's going to buy more agriculture, $50 billion may be and it's going to open its market to the financial sectors, but it already had started doing that, and that it won't play around with its currency. And it hasn't done that for a period of time.</p><p>But the fact that they're willing to talk and to continue to talk, I think is positive.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But then, even if the new tariffs are not imposed or the higher rates of tariffs, we are a long way it would seem from the removal of any of the existing tariffs.</p><p>HILLS: Absolutely. The fact that the hike in the October 15th tariffs will not occur, has not eliminated the pain that we are feeling across our economy, in consumers, workers and businesses with respect to the tariffs and is affecting our economy.</p><p>We have slowed. China has slowed and the global economy has slowed. This is a problem.</p><p>QUEST: And in the bigger picture, who is -- who has got the upper hand here? Because when I read on Friday what the Chinese had agreed to, and now we hear that they may not go ahead with it until there's a phase two. One wonders whether the U.S. is just -- is just being offered things to keep them quiet.</p><p>HILLS: I think that, as I said at the beginning, this is just a first step to come back to the table and work. I'm a little bit concerned because they first step has not been applauded hugely in China. They've been relatively quiet.</p><p>And the question is, when they start putting pen to paper and put an outline together, is it going to fall apart as it did this past spring?</p><p>QUEST: One other area, of course, of great importance is Europe and the question of whether the President is going to move forward with auto tariffs against Europe or whether going to turn up the pressure on European companies and governments. What's your feeling?</p><p>HILLS: Well, I certainly hope not. It's very hard to make the argument that the import of autos hurts our national security. And the real pain would be aimed at our closest allies.</p><p>Surely, we can sit down and talk about these issues. Negotiations and diplomacy have a very, very important part to play in our prosperity and security.</p><p>And I think we should try to come up with strategies and implement them through diplomatic efforts.</p><p>QUEST: Always good to see you. Thank you, Madam Ambassador. Carla Hills joining me from Washington. We appreciate your time.</p><p>HILLS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: The global market movers for you. Boeing shares are trading flat.

So this is the way they choose to express it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): But when violent protests paralyze the city, most Hong Kongers take heed of the police alerts sent to their mobile phones and avoid going out entirely and that means no dining, no shopping, no local consumption.</p><p>LU STOUT (on camera): The Hong Kong government has announced that August retail sales have plunged some 23 percent from a year earlier. That's the worst year-on-year decline for a single month on record.</p><p>The government cited subdued economic conditions, as well as severe disruptions to tourism and consumption related activities.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Lo Cheong Hei does not want to talk about politics.

Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: There are growing concerns over the fate of ISIS prisoners in Northern Syria, the Turkish Defense Minister says his military saw one ISIS jail, he claims was being emptied by the Kurds, who had controlled the area.</p><p>CNN has not been able to verify Turkey's account. That as the Syrian government troops are joining the Kurdish-led forces in their fight against Syria.</p><p>CNN's International Correspondent Arwa Damon is at the Turkish-Syrian border. This is exactly what everybody said was going to happen that the ISIS alleged terrorists would somehow be released that the Kurds would merge or at least would work with that former enemies, the Syrians against the Turkish.</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Richard. A couple of things are playing out simultaneously inside Syria at the moment. There's been a lot of claims and counterclaims as to who was released from what prison and exactly how, as well as what has happened specifically in one of the camps that is housing a few hundred of the ISIS wives and widows as they are called and whether or not they have managed to escape from that camp.</p><p>And then of course, you have the dynamics that are unfolding inside the Kurds, with no one left to turn to literally having to crawl on their knees back to the Syrian regime.</p><p>Worth noting, though, Richard, they did not exactly fight against Damascus when the revolution against the regime of Bashar al-Assad began and they always maintained loose ties with the regime. The regime always had its airport that was open in Qamishli, as well as a small military presence.</p><p>But both sides also were constantly talking to Russia. The Kurds were talking to Russia. The regime, obviously, backed by Russia and Russia has a relationship with the Turks.</p><p>What Russia is going to have to manage right now is what sort of deal can it negotiate to prevent a direct confrontation between the forces of Bashar al-Assad and those that are being backed by Turkey on the ground? That is going to be Russia's next challenge.</p><p>But at the moment, Richard, Russia is emerging as something as the clear winner at least when it comes to the geopolitical spectrum here because without firing a single shot with Turkey's incursion into Syria, Russia has managed to get rid of the Americans.</p><p>QUEST: Arwa Damon on the Turkish-Syrian border. Arwa, thank you.</p><p>At this very moment, the British Prime Minister is set to defend the Queen's Speech in the House of Commons. A crucial week in British politics.</p><p>[09:52:03]</p><p>QUEST: This critical week for Brexit began a short time ago with the pomp and ceremony. Her Majesty the Queen open Parliament. It was a speech that outlined the plans of the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The real focus, of course is on Brussels, where Brexit talks are difficult, and the E.U.'s negotiations are not quite certain.</p><p>Quentin Peel is with me, Associate Fellow at Chatham House. This morning had a little bit of an unreal air about it. Queen's Speech for a session that probably won't last that long. What's your understanding of where we stand with Brexit?</p><p>QUENTIN PEEL IS, ASSOCIATE FELLOW, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, I think we are very close to the line, obviously, in time terms, and it looks to me as if it's a pretty hopeless task of really getting a deal across the line in the time available.</p><p>Over the weekend, we heard that the Brussels negotiators were baffled by the British proposals as to how they want to get around the problem of having no border on the Island of Ireland.</p><p>And so I think they are grinding through detail and a long way from the result, which has really got to be delivered by -- well, at the end of Wednesday at the latest.</p><p>QUEST: So if they go into this Summit without any real concrete proposals or even if they're going with a scintilla of an agreement that needs fleshing out. At the end of the day, Boris Johnson still has to sign that letter if there's no deal by 11 o'clock on Saturday night.</p><p>PEEL: Yes, absolutely. That's what the law that the British Parliament has passed requires him to do that every day comes and he repeats that we're going to be out of the European Union with or without a deal by October 31st.</p><p>So the truth is that all the opposition parties in the British Parliament don't trust him, and Boris Johnson has no majority in the British Parliament. So he certainly seems to be in a very tight place.</p><p>But one way or another, he is trying to blag his way, if you like, to no deal.</p><p>QUEST: And on that issue, the DUP will stand for what? Labour will give what? I mean, what is it -- what is the key that unlocks a parliamentary majority for Boris Johnson?</p><p>PEEL: I think the only possible parliamentary majority for Brexit is for a soft Brexit. That's to say, pretty much like the sort of membership we have in the European Union.</p><p>But that sort of Brexit is absolutely not acceptable to the very hardest of the pro-Brexiteers in Johnson's own party and it's probably not acceptable either to the very hardest of the pro-Brexiteers in Johnson's own party. And it's probably not acceptable either to the Democratic Unionists from Northern Ireland, so he has a real problem.</p><p>[09:55:15]</p><p>PEEL: Every time he moves towards a compromise, that might be acceptable in Brussels and might be acceptable to a majority in Parliament, he loses the hardliners on his own side.</p><p>So he is really stuck and it's exactly where Theresa May was. So he is desperate to have an election.</p><p>QUEST: Which of course raises a whole host of other problems that you and I will talk about on another occasion. Quentin, it is very good to have you, as always, to make sense of it all. I do appreciate it. We do sometimes feel we are back to where we were and that's because we are back to where we were. But where we were is where we are and that's where we've got to move from.</p><p>You get the idea. That's it for FIRST MOVE. I'm Richard Quest.</p><p>Our coverage of the Queen's Speech continues. \"Connect the World\" is next with Becky Anderson. That's after a very short break.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019101401cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8N-FN41-JB20-G50B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

The toast by the queen caps a day of pageantry, including a review of the honor guard and a tour of Westminster Abbey.</p><p>But it's not all polite ceremony that's going on.

They have a host of issues to discuss, including trade.</p><p>It's also clear, Wolf, that President Trump has had other things on his mind while here in London as well. He has tweeted about Mexico and even complained about his cable TV options here, calling on a ban on a major American company, AT&amp;T, because he doesn't like what he sees on CNN -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: AT&amp;T, the parent company of CNN. Thank you very much, Pamela Brown, reporting from London.</p><p>Let's go live to Buckingham Palace right now. CNN Royal Correspondent, Max Foster is joining us.</p><p>Max, we saw the president and the queen. They toasted each other.</p><p>What was your takeaway from the queen's message to the president?</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: It was interesting. Both speeches hinged on D-Day and really celebrating those military and security ties between these two key allies.</p><p>But the queen went into it in this way, which is quite pointed I think for her. She talked about after the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. Whilst the world has changed, we're forever mindful of the original purposes of these structures.</p><p>I think there she's referring to NATO, the United Nations, probably the E.U. as well, all institutions which, on this side of the Atlantic, Donald Trump has seen as degrading and trying to break down. So I think that was quite pointed of her and actually verging on saying something political.</p><p>BLITZER: Max, on the one hand, we see President Trump following royal protocol, now that he's in London. On the other hand, he threw insults and diplomatic norms out the window before he arrived.</p><p>FOSTER: Well, state visits are meant to be above politics, generally, because they're hosted by the queen. It's extraordinary, the way he's thrown himself into politics here. It's not as controversial as you might think, because, in this country, the general feeling is that politics is pretty broken already and a lot of people will share his view about the way Brexit is being handled.</p><p>For example, no one necessarily feels it's going particularly well. Those were all political protocols, normally respected. You talk about how strong the politics is in the country, traditionally, when you come on these state visits.</p><p>What's interesting is he's throwing those political protocols out of the window but he's absolutely revering to royal protocols. The cameras didn't quite catch it but there was a slight nod as he met the queen, a bow, arguably.</p><p>But he's on the same level as the queen. He's not a British subject, he doesn't need to do that. And actually a member of the British media was speaking to me a bit earlier, saying his speech at times almost felt like a love letter to the queen, talking about her being this great, great woman. Utter reverence, which you don't often see from him, of course.</p><p>BLITZER: She is an amazing woman, 93 years old, very, very impressive. Max Foster, in London for us, thank you.</p><p>Also breaking tonight, Congress is back in session here in Washington and the House Judiciary Committee has wasted no time in announcing new hearings on the Mueller report. Let's go to our Congressional Correspondent, Sunlen Serfaty. Sunlen, what is the strategy with these new hearings?</p><p>SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The House Judiciary Committee, Wolf, announcing today a series of hearings that will kick off on Monday, specifically focused on the substance and the content of the Robert Mueller report.</p><p>It kicks off Monday with a huge figure, of course, from the Watergate scandal, former White House Counsel John Dean, as well as other prosecutors, legal experts will be testifying up here on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And this is part of a shift, a refocusing by House Democrats to try to get the attention and the conversation refocused on the actual substance of the Mueller report. There, of course, has been so much conversation in recent days about contempt votes, subpoenas, all the back and forth and nuts and bolts.</p><p>The feeling here on Capitol Hill, they need to reset, refocus on the actual substance. It also comes at a time as there has been growing calls among House Democrats to push for at least the opening up of an impeachment inquiry; by CNN's latest count, 56 members of the Democratic caucus now support that.</p><p>Of course, that puts a lot of attention this week on Nancy Pelosi. The House gets back from a week-long recess --</p><p>[17:10:00]</p><p>SERFATY: -- tonight. And they'll, of course, convene for their weekly meeting tomorrow, where, most definitely, this will be a topic of conversation.</p><p>BLITZER: Certainly will be. Sunlen, you're also learning that the House Oversight Committee is now working to hold both William Barr and the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt in relation to the 2020 U.S. Census.</p><p>What's behind this latest move?</p><p>SERFATY: That's right. This is another example of House Democrats trying to intensify the pressure in all avenues on the Trump administration. Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, he says he's threatening to hold the attorney general, Barr and Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress if they do not hand over the documents, as you said, related to a 2020 citizenship question on a 2020 census.</p><p>They are right now in defiance of a congressional subpoena. So Elijah Cummings giving them until Thursday to hand over these documents and really trying to paint this as a picture of overall stonewalling of the Trump administration.</p><p>Cummings in a statement tonight, again, threatening to hold them in contempt, saying that their actions are part of a pattern in the Trump administration and he said he will consider postponing a contempt vote if they hand over what they've been requested by Thursday -- Wolf. BLITZER: We'll see what happens, Sunlen, thank you very much. Sunlen Serfaty up on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Joining us now, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He's a member of both the Intelligence and the Oversight Committees.</p><p>Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, at least 56 House Democrats are now calling for impeachment or beginning at least impeachment proceedings against the president.</p><p>Where do you stand?</p><p>REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D), ILLINOIS: I think that the Mueller report laid out impeachable conduct, especially the obstruction of justice parts of the report, Volume II.</p><p>I think that the concern that I have is we want to begin the impeachment proceedings at a time when we've collected enough evidence to get to a conviction.</p><p>I think that the concern of folks like myself and others is that you don't want to have impeachment be an empty exercise, where the result could be the president being absolved and then being able to legitimately claim total exoneration, which would be a horrible result.</p><p>So I think that, right now, we have to do our homework, complete the investigations, gather as much evidence as possible, which is what we're trying to do, and move the American people to where we are right now.</p><p>BLITZER: So when you say conviction, are you referring to a conviction in the Senate, 67 votes would be needed in the Senate, 20 Republicans would have to vote for conviction, even if the president were impeached in the House?</p><p>Is that the requirement you're seeking?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Yes, I think that we have to get to a place where we meet with the approval of the American people, where a large majority of the American people are where we are, which is that this obstruction of justice conduct is really unacceptable for a president to engage in.</p><p>BLITZER: According to a new CNN poll, as of right now, only 41 percent of Americans want to see the president impeached and removed from office while 54 percent disagree.</p><p>Are you taking that political calculus into account?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, I think what we know is that we could possibly impeach the president in the House. But unfortunately, in the Senate, it appears a conviction is unlikely because of in party what you just cited with those statistics.</p><p>I think part of the reason why the American public is not there is because they're not necessarily familiar with all the details of the Mueller report, which is what the Judiciary Committee is trying to address by having these hearings.</p><p>And part of it is we have to gather more evidence, which is, I think, what Mr. Mueller was pointing to in his Volume II when he said we needed to resolve certain issues before getting to a judgment of prosecution.</p><p>So that's what we have to do right now and what we're trying to do in the Intelligence Committee, the Oversight Committee, the Judiciary Committee and others.</p><p>BLITZER: Let's get to some other sensitive issues unfolding as we speak.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: What other sensitive issues.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BLITZER: There are plenty of them, including an interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios. In that interview, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, said he wasn't sure whether he would call the FBI if he received another phone call, another offer from a Russian offering dirt on a political opponent. I want you to listen to this exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS: Does it not set off at least some alarm bell when you see an email saying that the Russian government wants to help --</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: Like I said, the email that I got on my iPhone at the time basically said, show up at 4:00.</p><p>I didn't scroll down; I never would have thought about that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SWAN: It had Russia in the subject line.</p><p>KUSHNER: Again, I would get about 250 --</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>KUSHNER: -- emails a day. And so literally saw \"show up at 4:00.\" I showed up at 4:00 --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SWAN: But would you call the FBI if it happened again?</p><p>KUSHNER: I don't know. It's hard to do hypotheticals. But the reality is, we were not given anything that was salacious. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: What's your reaction?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's completely unbelievable that, A, he did not know that the Russians were coming to potentially offer dirt on Hillary Clinton. That's the reason why Don Jr. suggested the meeting.</p><p>And, two, the fact that he would say that he wouldn't refer this particular -- the subject of this meeting to the FBI for further investigation and that he would take the meeting is very, very problematic.</p><p>One of the reasons why Mueller did not charge them with a campaign finance violation is because they did not know the law with regard to campaign finance violations and receiving foreign contributions.</p><p>To say that now, after what Bob Mueller did in the report and knowing that accepting something of value from a foreign entity would be a campaign finance violation and then saying you wouldn't still go to the FBI if someone approached you, is very, very problematic.</p><p>BLITZER: You heard our correspondent, our congressional correspondent, Sunlen Serfaty, report that your committee, the Oversight Committee, is setting up votes, potentially to hold the attorney general William Barr, the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to turn over documents related to a controversial citizenship question in the 2020 census.</p><p>What information specifically is your committee missing?</p><p>And do you believe this vote will force these officials to comply?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, recently, we learned from documents obtained from a computer of a Republican strategist, someone who is familiar and involved with this citizenship question being placed on the survey, that this was done for purposes of giving the Republicans an advantage in the polls in the next election.</p><p>And so we are trying to get more information about what they knew, specifically Wilbur Ross and Mr. Barr, with regard to that information we just learned.</p><p>I was at the hearing where Wilbur Ross came before us. He was very evasive. He claimed the reason why the citizenship question has been placed on the census is so the Justice Department can better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p><p>That's a laughable proposition. I think it was a pretext for what they're really trying to do, which is trying to advantage the Republican Party through placing the citizenship question in and depressing the number of Latinos and other immigrants who would otherwise answer the questions on the survey.</p><p>So that's what we're trying to get at and I think that if they don't comply with the request by the deadline that's set by Chairman Cummings, I think a contempt vote would be very appropriate.</p><p>BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: Up next, there's more breaking news. A key witness in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation has just been arrested on child pornography allegations.</p><p>And authorities release emails sent by the Virginia Beach gunman just hours before he attacked his coworkers.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[17:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BLITZER: We have breaking news coming into THE SITUATION ROOM. A man who was a key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation has been arrested for child pornography allegations. Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell. She's working the story for us.</p><p>Kara, what are you learning?</p><p>KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Earlier this morning, George Nader, who was one of the key witnesses in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, was arrested when he arrived in New York at JFK Airport on allegations and charges he was transporting images of children involved in graphic videos.</p><p>Now these charges were unsealed today but they were initially made in April of 2018. That was after Nader had already been cooperating with Robert Mueller's team. He was a key witness in that investigation, cited in over 4 dozen footnotes in the report and also providing information and testimony relating to the Seychelles meeting, where Erik prince met with a Russian money manager as well as meeting with the crowned prince of the UAE and members of Trump's transition team.</p><p>These charges today are not the first time that Nader has been charged with transporting child pornography. He was also charged in 1991 and pleaded guilty then. He's being arraigned and presented in court in Brooklyn this afternoon. And he will then be transported back to Virginia, where he'll face these charges.</p><p>BLITZER: He potentially could spend years and years in jail.</p><p>SCANNELL: This charge carries a minimum 15-year sentence if he's found guilty and that could go up from there. So he's looking at significant jail time.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Kara Scannell, we'll stay on top of that story as well. Thank you. And there's other breaking news up on Capitol Hill. The House Judiciary Committee has just announced what's being described as a top-to-bottom investigation of some of the nation's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Let's go to CNN's Brian Fung.</p><p>Brian, this is a really significant investigation of the tech industry here in the United States.</p><p>So what impact --</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>BLITZER: -- will it have?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is an enormous new challenge to the tech industry, which is, let's remember, already faces a lot of potential scrutiny from anti-trust agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and regulators at the Justice Department.</p><p>I'm told that this investigation could cover things such as Google's dominance in search and advertising. It could cover things like Amazon's power in ecommerce and potentially Facebook's dominance in online communications.</p><p>So overall, this is going to be a very wide-ranging investigation, could cover a lot of companies, not just the big tech companies but a wide array of others as well.</p><p>BLITZER: A truly significant development, indeed. Brian Fung, thank you very much.</p><p>There's other breaking news in London, where President Trump and the first lady will soon be wrapping up their state banquet with Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>[17:30:32] BLITZER: We're following breaking news on CNN. The House Judiciary Committee, this afternoon, announced a series of hearings focusing in on what the committee is calling the alleged crimes and other misconduct laid out in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. Let's bring in our political and legal experts.</p><p>And, Laura Jarrett, is this a really significant set of hearings, or is it designed to set the motion for possible impeachment proceedings?</p><p>LAURA JARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think if Democrats want to go down the impeachment road, they're going to have to sell it to the American people. And right now, the American people are not buying this sell. The CNN poll that's out today, I think, bears that out.</p><p>And so what do the hearings do? It provides an opportunity, I think, for Democrats, as Sunlen was reporting, to reset. Because for so long, we've been talking about subpoenas, we've been talks about documents, but they're not talking about the substance of the report. And so I think what the Democrats want to do is actually dig into what Mueller found while, at the same time, making for very good T.V. with John Dean, which also rings back to Watergate.</p><p>CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Yes. I would argue that, strategically, they'd be better off -- just to echo Laura, Democrats would be better off to not use the word \"impeach\" all that often and simply say there were a number of allegations of potential obstruction in the Mueller report. We are running those down, as is consistent with our oversight capability.</p><p>Because as soon as you say the word \"impeachment,\" you immediately put it in this Republicans versus Democrats, right versus left, Trump haters versus Trump lovers. And there just aren't enough people in that first camp, the people who say, yes, we need to impeach him today.</p><p>Yes, there are plenty of Democrats but not enough people who aren't Democrats to make up a majority, so I think they have to change the language they talk about it. Because Laura is right, they have to change the dynamic in the country of -- as it relates to impeaching Donald Trump because, right now, there's not a majority.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they're kind of treading water, though.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: Because they need somebody like a Don McGahn. They need somebody like a Hope Hicks. They need somebody to tell the story -- I think Don McGahn in particular -- and that's kind of at a standoff right now.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: And so what they're trying to do is kind of tell the story without having the main protagonist there.</p><p>JARRETT: The senior characters.</p><p>BORGER: Yes. And that's --</p><p>CILLIZZA: The biography that the candidate didn't approve of like you said.</p><p>BORGER: And that's a real problem for them. And so it's -- I know what they're trying to do, but it's going to be tough.</p><p>SUSAN HENNESSEY, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY AND LEGAL ANALYST: No, but it is a smart strategy, sort of picking up on what Robert Mueller said last week. Mueller was clearly frustrated that people hadn't read the report, the members of Congress hadn't read the report.</p><p>And I think Gloria is absolutely right. In the absence of those key witnesses that they know they're going to have to litigate to get, they're trying to bring in people to tell the story. Now, it's not just John Dean that they're planning to have in hearings. It's also former prosecutors.</p><p>That's going to be a strategy to -- you know, right, Robert Mueller declined to render that traditional prosecutorial judgment about whether or not Donald Trump committed a crime of obstruction of justice. The Attorney General, Bill Barr, weighed in with his opinion.</p><p>Getting lawyers on the stand to actually talk about the strength of that case -- whether or not they would have brought charges, whether or not they think the Attorney General's case was especially weak -- that's all going to be key in sort of making the case to the American public.</p><p>Now, the one problem with somebody like John Dean is he's been a public critic of the President.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>HENNESSEY: So this is certainly going to fuel perceptions that this is all about partisanship and politics, and that's a very careful line. They need people who are going to make compelling T.V. without feeding that narrative.</p><p>BLITZER: Fifty-six House Democrats so far have publicly called for impeachment proceedings to begin.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Fifty-six out of, what, 230?</p><p>CILLIZZA: Two hundred thirty, yes.</p><p>BORGER: Yes, but you can't have a trial without witnesses. And it's difficult. It's really difficult.</p><p>CILLIZZA: And without high profile --</p><p>BORGER: And John Dean may be persuasive, but he is not a witness.</p><p>CILLIZZA: And with high profile --</p><p>BLITZER: He's a CNN contributor.</p><p>BORGER: Yes.</p><p>CILLIZZA: And with high profile witness. Gloria's point, I think, is -- without McGahn or Hope Hicks or Mueller, it's going to be hard, I think, to -- yes, prosecutors saying, well, if this was me, I would have done it, it would make headlines.</p><p>BORGER: Sure.</p><p>CILLIZZA: I just don't know that that changes -- without new information from one of these insider players, I don't know that it changes, broadly speaking, how people see this. BLITZER: All right, let me move on to this interview that Jared Kushner granted to Jonathan Swan of Axios. And he struggled with the questions about why the then-candidate, the then-private citizen, Donald Trump railed against President Obama and the birtherism issue. Listen to this exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Was birtherism racist?</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, I wasn't really involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: I know you weren't.</p><p>KUSHNER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>SWAN: Was it racist?</p><p>KUSHNER: Like I said, I wasn't really involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: I know you weren't.</p><p>KUSHNER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>[17:35:00] SWAN: Was it racist?</p><p>KUSHNER: Look, I know who the President is, and I have not seen anything in him that is racist. So, again, I was not involved in that.</p><p>SWAN: Did you wish he didn't do that?</p><p>KUSHNER: Like I said, I was not involved in that. That was a long time ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: What do you think, Gloria?</p><p>BORGER: O.K., there were four \"I was not involved in that.\" And, look, it was completely evasive. It was disgraceful to me.</p><p>All you needed to do -- even if you weren't involved in that, all you need to do is say that, you know, I think that was the wrong thing to do. It was not a good thing to do. I wish he hadn't done it.</p><p>But, of course, he's the President's son-in-law. He doesn't want to get the President angry. He is trying to stay in his good graces. And one way to get in his bad graces is to criticize him, so he didn't want to do it. But he looked so kind of pathetic back there.</p><p>HENNESSEY: And the reason why --</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. HENNESSEY: The reason why is because the answer to that question is obviously yes.</p><p>BORGER: Yes. Yes, yes.</p><p>HENNESSEY: It is obviously racist to accuse the first African- American president of the United States without evidence of not having been born in this country! And so part of the reason why Kushner was sort of flummoxed there was he couldn't actually give the answer that everybody plainly understands --</p><p>CILLIZZA: And it's --</p><p>HENNESSEY: You know, understands to be true.</p><p>BORGER: And the President, even as a candidate, finally come out at one point, if I recall --</p><p>CILLIZZA: He did, sort of.</p><p>BORGER: -- and sort of say, well, I was wrong, kind of.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Well, and that's the other --</p><p>BORGER: And he said Hillary started it, yes.</p><p>CILLIZZA: That's the other thing, is that -- Gloria's exactly right about the, well, I wasn't involved in it. Look -- involved in what?</p><p>BORGER: That's not the question.</p><p>CILLIZZA: But also, the, \"it was a long time ago.\" You mean like 2016? I mean, like three years ago. Like, a long time ago is like 1950, not 2016.</p><p>I mean, he isn't out in the public eye all that much for what I think to be, from the White House's perspective, pretty good reasons. He is not a terribly -- whatever you think of him behind the scenes, he is not a terribly gifted front of the camera messenger.</p><p>He's just not. He's evasive, not just on this but on a number of issues. He wouldn't -- when he's talking about Middle East peace process, very evasive. Basically said, I talk to a lot of people. I don't really talk about who I talk to ever, but it's a lot of people. You'd know them.</p><p>You know, he is just -- he is not the front and center guy. The granting of this interview, I think, is interesting, the decision to have done this, given that he really had nothing to say and only really created negative headlines.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right. Look, this interview really was sort of a testament to the reason why we have an anti-nepotism law in the federal government.</p><p>I don't know anybody who had watched that interview last night and thought that Jared Kushner has the intellect and capacity and grasp of the issues to effectively serve in the position that he is serving. Nor anyone who'd make the argument that he wouldn't be in that room if he wasn't the President's son-in-law.</p><p>JARRETT: His answers, actually, I think, on the FBI and Russia --</p><p>BORGER: Oh.</p><p>JARRETT: I mean, the birtherism gets attention because, obviously, it's just so hard to watch. But on the FBI and Russia, the fact that he can't unequivocally say that was a bad idea, obviously, you should contact the FBI if you're contacted by the Russians --</p><p>BORGER: Yes.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Well, the MBS stuff, just --</p><p>JARRETT: Like, that's -- there's no lesson learned.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Just the stuff about Mohammad bin Salman and essentially saying, like, well, we thought it was best to handle it in private and that's the -- there's an ongoing investigation.</p><p>And Jon Swan of Axios says, well, the entire -- the Senate voted unanimously to say he's behind it. Well, we're going to let the investigation play out. I mean, there's a lot in there.</p><p>BORGER: Well --</p><p>CILLIZZA: The birtherism thing, right, draws the attention, but he, on a number of fronts, was really bad.</p><p>BORGER: On -- I just have to add that on Russia, he couldn't even say, on second thought, I would have maybe picked up the phone --</p><p>CILLIZZA: Right.</p><p>BORGER: -- and called the general counsel of the campaign. You shouldn't do that.</p><p>BLITZER: And he should have said, if it happens again, I'll call the FBI.</p><p>BORGER: Of course.</p><p>BLITZER: But that's another matter. Everybody, stick around. There's more breaking news in the investigation of the Virginia Beach massacre. Investigators just released an e-mail exchange the attacker had with his employers only hours before the shooting started.</p><p>[17:38:50] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: There's breaking news in the investigation of the mass shooting that left 12 people dead in Virginia Beach. Authorities just released copies of e-mails the gunman sent only hours before Friday's attack started. Our national correspondent Miguel Marquez is joining us from Virginia Beach right now. Miguel, tell us more.</p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf, that exchange of e-mails was as short and as pleasant as can be. And even though the names were redacted on some of them, it is likely that the person he exchanged those e-mails with was one of the people he killed several hours later.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): The investigation turns to why. Why a 40-year- old 15-year city worker turned a gun on his colleagues.</p><p>OFFICER JAMES CERVERA, CHIEF OF POLICE, VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT: He was not terminated and he was not in the process of being terminated.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): The motive, still a mystery. The shooter's resignation e-mail, short and concise, writing, it has been a pleasure to serve the city, but due to personal reasons, I must relieve my position.</p><p>The City Manager saying the shooter's job was not under threat, his work satisfactory, with no issues of discipline ongoing. Victims, their families, and those who witnessed America's latest mass shooting trying to make sense of it all.</p><p>CHRISTI DEWAR, WITNESS OF THE VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING: Then we heard pop, pop, pop. This is not a drill. This is for all real. Get out of the building, get off your calls, run.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): Witnesses say the shooter was firing in quick and controlled three-round bursts. The shooter appeared to begin his rampage in the office of the immediate boss.</p><p>DEWAR: We all started running towards the south exit, towards the south stairwell. And somebody screamed in front of us, it's too late, run the other way.</p><p>[17:45:00] MARQUEZ (voice-over): Christi DeWar says she wasn't able to get out in time, and she and colleagues hid, just feet away from the shooter.</p><p>DEWAR: We pushed a metal filing cabinet against the door, and he fired four times. Two of the bullets almost came through the back of the cabinet and left bulges.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): A horrific scene complicated by confusion.</p><p>NED CARLSTROM, WITNESS OF THE VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING: I thought he was playing the part of an active shooter for our drill.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): Ned Carlstrom said he walked right by the shooter and thought he wasn't serious as the city had active shooter training planned the next day. CARLSTROM: It looked so theatrical because of the extended magazine and the suppressor that was at the end of it.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): The suppressor, say witnesses, made the gunfire sound more like this. A nail gun used in construction.</p><p>For victims and those trying to stop the shooter, it was difficult to immediately discern what was happening. Two veteran detectives rushed into the building to confront the shooter. Its interior offices described as maze-like.</p><p>CERVERA: Five to eight minutes after these officers began to enter the building, they made contact and engaged the suspect on the second floor of the building.</p><p>MARQUEZ (voice-over): The shooter had extended magazines on at least two .45 caliber handguns. He fired on police.</p><p>CERVERA: They were returning fire. And at one point, the suspect was firing through the door and through the wall at the officers. And then the firing stopped.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARQUEZ: Now, I want to give you a sense, Wolf, of the growing memorial here at Virginia Beach to these 12 individuals who have been killed. People come here just to lay some flowers, to say a prayer, and hope that their community can get beyond this.</p><p>The only person killed in this that was not a government employee was Bert Snelling. He was found in his car deceased. Still unclear to investigators whether he was shot inside and got to his car or whether he was shot their first and then the shooter went in. Still more questions -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Heartbreaking. So heartbreaking. Miguel Marquez on the scene for us. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, one of North Korea's top diplomats resurfaces after reports he'd been purged and sent to a labor camp.</p><p>[17:51:53] BLITZER: A top North Korean official reportedly sent to a labor camp after the failed summit with President Trump has now resurfaced. At least that's how Kim Jong-un's regime is portraying it.</p><p>Let's go live to CNN's Will Ripley. He's joining us from Hong Kong with the very latest. What are you learning, Will?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We know, Wolf, that Kim Yong-chol disappeared from state media for nearly two months, which is very unusual for a high-ranking official. We don't know what happened to him, and we still don't know what happened to the rest of his negotiating team. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): This is the picture North Korea wants you to see, Kim Yong-chol, the high-ranking official reportedly banished for the failed Hanoi summit, sitting just a few seats away from Kim Jong- un at an art performance over the weekend.</p><p>His hands cover his face, but if this state media photo is authentic, it directly, perhaps intentionally, challenges a South Korean newspaper report that Kim Yong-chol has been dismissed and is doing forced labor, exiled by a North Korean leader furious over the stunning collapse of talks in Vietnam and President Trump's surprising walk out.</p><p>The report, based on a single anonymous source, would have signaled a dramatic fall for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's negotiating partner. The man who was in the Oval Office earlier this year, delivering a letter from Chairman Kim to President Trump.</p><p>CNN checked with numerous sources and was not able to verify \"Chosun Ilbo's\" reporting. We've reached out to the paper for comment.</p><p>This photo is North Korean media's first mention of Kim Yong-chol in nearly two months. Analysts say that's unusual for such a high- ranking official. Adding to the mystery, there's still no sign of special envoy to the U.S., Kim Hyok-chol.</p><p>The same South Korean paper reported he was executed in March on charges of being recruited by U.S. imperialists and betraying the Supreme Leader. A senior diplomatic source told CNN last week the North Korean envoy has certainly disappeared, but there's no independent information or intelligence at this point on what's happened.</p><p>Kim Jong-un has been known to execute officials accused of crimes like corruption or treason, including his own uncle in 2013. But South Korean media has a spotty track record of reporting North Korean purges.</p><p>In 2013, the same papers said singer Hyon Song-wol was executed by firing squad, but she was very much alive in 2018, leading a performing arts delegation to the Winter Olympics.</p><p>This photo may prove Kim Yong-chol is alive and well, but as for the rest of his negotiating team? Unknown.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIPLEY: And because his hands are covered in that photo, Wolf, we actually don't know for sure if it's Kim Yong-chol in the picture.</p><p>We're also monitoring reports right now that Kim's younger sister has reappeared at his side in a recent event, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. We'll watch it all of these very closely. Will Ripley in Hong Kong. Thank you. Coming up, breaking news. Queen Elizabeth caps a day of pageantry and ceremony by hosting President Trump and the first lady at a state banquet.</p><p>[17:55:02] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[17:59:56] BLITZER: Happening now, breaking news. Trump and circumstance. The President revels in the trappings of royalty as Queen Elizabeth pulls out the stops for his state, including dinner and toast at the palace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060301CNV16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-V511-JB20-G2W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meghan Markle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mueller Report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>London</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Queen Elizabeth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prince Harry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brexit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Theresa May</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>D-Day</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House Judiciary Committee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>William Barr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wilbur Ross</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House Oversight Committee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice Department</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kim Jong-un</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjY5MjRCQzAyQjY0NDJFMThDNkJCNjdGQzMxNkY4RjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1MEVBQUFGMjc2NDk4Qjg0QkY0OUM4N0QyNkNCNjU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODAxMkJDODE1OEM0NERCNzhFOUU1OTdGRTA1OUI1NTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

A spokesperson for the department said the tender was part of ongoing reform across the media sector.    \u201cIn December 2019, the Government announced it would be undertaking a staged process of regulatory reform towards platform-neutral regulation of the Australian media as part of its response to the ACCC\u2019s Digital Platforms Inquiry report,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications said.   \u201cThe Department seeks expert advice on the range of media business models that have been adopted in overseas markets, and what measures have been put in place, or are being considered, to support media providers to transition to a more sustainable footing.

QUT is home to the Digital Media Research Centre which will produce the Assessment of Media Business Models and Supports by the beginning of October.   The review follows the 18-month Digital Platforms Inquiry and is thought to be part of an ongoing series of budget changes across the media industry. It\u2019s likely that content requirements will also be part of the review.

Les d\u00e9bats, comit\u00e9s et plans europ\u00e9ens font foison. Chaque pays se fait le chantre d'initiatives pour stimuler ses p\u00e9pini\u00e8res - la France a la Banque Publique d'Investissement; nos voisins transalpins soutiennent le Fondo Strategico Italiano; outre-Manche, l'\u00c9tat sponsorise la British Business Bank, le British Growth Fund et a exprim\u00e9 l'intention de lancer un fonds souverain malgr\u00e9 un endettement record. Chaque capitale y va de son projet d'incubation - Paris a Station F, Berlin sa Silicon Allee, Londres son Silicon Roundabout. </p><p>Toutes ces mesures individuelles, bien que louables, contribuent \u00e0 un certain \u00e9miettement et font p\u00e2le figure face aux mastodontes de la C\u00f4te Ouest. Les seuls secteurs o\u00f9 l'Europe a su forger son expertise technique sont ceux consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme strat\u00e9giques (l'espace, la d\u00e9fense, le nucl\u00e9aire) ou d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par les \u00c9tats-Unis du fait d'une demande domestique limit\u00e9e (les trains \u00e0 grande vitesse). Pourtant, ce qui s'est, jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, av\u00e9r\u00e9 impossible aux gouvernements et startuppeurs europ\u00e9ens a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par un pays qui passa une bonne partie du 20e si\u00e8cle en autarcie quasi totale et ininterrompue. \u00c0 vrai dire, l\u00e0 est peut \u00eatre le secret de son succ\u00e8s. Le challenge La Chine, avec ses BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) ainsi que ses p\u00e9pites monotech Didi Chuxing, ByteDance et Meituan, est en passe d'instituer une alternative. Comment a-t-elle r\u00e9ussi l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l'Europe a \u00e9chou\u00e9? L'epire du Milieu a vite appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 leur d\u00e9votion sans partage pour la d\u00e9r\u00e9glementation et la libre entreprise, les start-up\u00a0am\u00e9ricaines attendent des autorit\u00e9s locales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qu'elles mettent la main \u00e0 la poche. Amazon, par exemple, a re\u00e7u au fil des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e8s de 3 milliards de dollars de cr\u00e9dits d'imp\u00f4ts de la ville de Seattle au profit de ses d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et centres de donn\u00e9es. En 2018, le pionnier du commerce en ligne avait lanc\u00e9 une comp\u00e9tition nationale d\u00e9sormais c\u00e9l\u00e8bre pour d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 implanter son deuxi\u00e8me si\u00e8ge social, mettant les maires et gouverneurs en concurrence pour savoir lesquels offriraient le plus de carottes fiscales \u00e0 une entreprise valoris\u00e9e \u00e0 1 trillion de dollars et enregistrant 12,4 milliards de dollars de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices op\u00e9rationnels cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Pareillement, sur la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, l'\u00e9tat de Californie a contribu\u00e9 plusieurs milliards de dollars d'aides aux ambitions d'Elon Musk pour Tesla, SolarCity et SpaceX. C'est Deng Xiaoping qui mit en place les r\u00e9formes n\u00e9cessaires dans les ann\u00e9es 1980 en permettant l'essor de Zones \u00c9conomiques Sp\u00e9ciales partiellement d\u00e9fiscalis\u00e9es. Depuis lors, la Chine d\u00e9veloppe son \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me en contr\u00f4lant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses march\u00e9s tout comme, au 19e si\u00e8cle, les \u00c9tats-Unis prot\u00e9geaient les leurs des produits europ\u00e9ens. Les tarifs McKinley, fix\u00e9s \u00e0 49.5% et introduits en 1890, avaient eu un tel impact qu'ils furent m\u00eame baptis\u00e9s le \"Napol\u00e9on de la protection.\" Restrictions douani\u00e8res - anath\u00e8me des partisans de la globalisation - et g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses subventions ont donc permis aux jeunes pousses chinoises d'asseoir leur pr\u00e9dominance dans plusieurs activit\u00e9s. Alibaba, \u00e0 l'origine un simple ersatz d'Amazon, poss\u00e8de par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'Ant Financial l'un des principaux modes de paiement \u00e9lectronique dans le monde: Alipay. Le laiss\u00e9-pour-compte En somme, la Chine a su imposer son capitalisme d'\u00c9tat comme alternative \u00e0 la version plus sauvage, mais consid\u00e9rablement assist\u00e9e, d'outre-Atlantique. Aujourd'hui, parmi les dix plus grosses capitalisations mondiales du secteur technologique, six sont am\u00e9ricaines et quatre asiatiques, dont deux chinoises. Cela signifie que le destin industriel de l'Europe ne lui appartient plus. L'erreur commise, c'est de n'avoir pas remarqu\u00e9 combien la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique n\u00e9cessiterait des besoins en financement colossaux. Les dix principales firmes Tech de l'Union europ\u00e9enne justifient d'une valeur boursi\u00e8re \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 8% de leurs homologues am\u00e9ricains, alors qu'apr\u00e8s l'IPO imminente d'Ant Financial le top 10 chinois en repr\u00e9sentera environ un quart. Le Royaume-Uni, incessamment lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du carcan de Bruxelles et plein d'espoir de reconqu\u00eate, voit ses dix \"champions\" peser moins d'un centi\u00e8me des g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains. Loin des places boursi\u00e8res, l'Europe ne compte aucune d\u00e9cacorne (startup non cot\u00e9e, financ\u00e9e par du capital-risque, d'une valeur d'au moins 10 milliards de dollars) quand l'Am\u00e9rique en compte onze et la Chine six, y compris Bytedance, valoris\u00e9 \u00e0 140 milliards de dollars et propri\u00e9taire de TikTok, l'appli qualifi\u00e9e par Donald Trump de cybermenace. L'apr\u00e8s-Brexit s'annonce douloureux. Le mod\u00e8le chinois d\u00e9montre que la meilleure (la seule?) mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9fier les \u00c9tats-Unis, c'est d'adopter une politique de coordination exemplaire et de d\u00e9fendre son territoire. Les Britanniques, grands pr\u00eatres du lib\u00e9ralisme \u00e9conomique depuis Adam Smith, ont r\u00e9cemment pris conscience du danger et pr\u00e9parent un projet de loi pour prot\u00e9ger leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s technologiques des pr\u00e9dateurs \u00e9trangers. \u00c0 voir si cette ligne de conduite fera des \u00e9mules. Cela irait bien \u00e9videmment \u00e0 l'encontre des conditions vues comme sine qua non au bon fonctionnement du capitalisme, telle que l'\u00e9limination de toute entrave r\u00e9gulatrice. Hors, ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 largement d\u00e9r\u00e9glement\u00e9 leur \u00e9conomie, les \u00c9tats-Unis sont imbattables aux jeux du laisser-faire et de la prise de risque; une attitude qui contraste profond\u00e9ment avec l'id\u00e9ologie socio-lib\u00e9rale et paternaliste de nombreux pays europ\u00e9ens. Un r\u00f4le subalterne Alors que les \u00c9tats-Unis et la Chine se chamaillent \u00e0 coups de mesures protectionnistes, l'enjeu est devenu primordial. Si l'Europe souhaite pr\u00e9server sa souverainet\u00e9, entrepreneurs, investisseurs et instances f\u00e9d\u00e9rales doivent s'organiser sur un plan r\u00e9ellement supranational. Malheureusement, le plan de relance sign\u00e9 en juillet fait peu de place aux technologies. Sans sombrer dans le dirigisme \u00e9conomique, ce f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme requi\u00e8re une politique commune de barri\u00e8res \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e et d'aides publiques \u00e0 l'innovation et \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'entreprises au sein de technopoles \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle continentale. Car si elle ne parvient pas \u00e0 parer les GAFAM et autres BAT, l'Europe se verra cantonn\u00e9e dans trois fonctions accessoires :</p><p>1/ Celle de sous-traitant, non pas pour produire \u00e0 bon march\u00e9, mais pour adapter les technologies \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux exigences locales; 2/ Celle de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 commercial, laissant les firmes am\u00e9ricaines et chinoises tirer profit de consommateurs sans substituts; 3/ Celle de mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re, soit pour permettre aux innovateurs \u00e9trangers de d\u00e9pouiller les donn\u00e9es personnelles des utilisateurs europ\u00e9ens, soit pour voir les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de pointe du continent en mal de capitaux servir de cibles d'acquisition. Bient\u00f4t le probl\u00e8me ne sera pas tant que, dans ce match de boxe, l'Europe est dans les cordes; notre continent sera tout bonnement hors du ring, observant les superwelters am\u00e9ricains et chinois se battre pour le titre de premi\u00e8re puissance technologique du 21e si\u00e8cle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRIBNE-979596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRIBNE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-94M1-F12R-V1TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234496</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 La Tribune Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>La Tribune</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51640\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Samedi 5 Septembre 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Les d\u00e9bats, comit\u00e9s et plans europ\u00e9ens font foison. Chaque pays se fait le chantre d'initiatives pour stimuler ses p\u00e9pini\u00e8res - la France a la Banque Publique d'Investissement; nos voisins transalpins soutiennent le Fondo Strategico Italiano; outre-Manche, l'\u00c9tat sponsorise la British Business Bank, le British Growth Fund et a exprim\u00e9 l'intention de lancer un fonds souverain malgr\u00e9 un endettement record. Chaque capitale y va de son projet d'incubation - Paris a Station F, Berlin sa Silicon Allee, Londres son Silicon Roundabout. </p><p>Toutes ces mesures individuelles, bien que louables, contribuent \u00e0 un certain \u00e9miettement et font p\u00e2le figure face aux mastodontes de la C\u00f4te Ouest. Les seuls secteurs o\u00f9 l'Europe a su forger son expertise technique sont ceux consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme strat\u00e9giques (l'espace, la d\u00e9fense, le nucl\u00e9aire) ou d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par les \u00c9tats-Unis du fait d'une demande domestique limit\u00e9e (les trains \u00e0 grande vitesse). Pourtant, ce qui s'est, jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, av\u00e9r\u00e9 impossible aux gouvernements et startuppeurs europ\u00e9ens a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par un pays qui passa une bonne partie du 20e si\u00e8cle en autarcie quasi totale et ininterrompue. \u00c0 vrai dire, l\u00e0 est peut \u00eatre le secret de son succ\u00e8s. Le challenge La Chine, avec ses BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) ainsi que ses p\u00e9pites monotech Didi Chuxing, ByteDance et Meituan, est en passe d'instituer une alternative. Comment a-t-elle r\u00e9ussi l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l'Europe a \u00e9chou\u00e9? L'epire du Milieu a vite appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 leur d\u00e9votion sans partage pour la d\u00e9r\u00e9glementation et la libre entreprise, les start-up\u00a0am\u00e9ricaines attendent des autorit\u00e9s locales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qu'elles mettent la main \u00e0 la poche. Amazon, par exemple, a re\u00e7u au fil des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e8s de 3 milliards de dollars de cr\u00e9dits d'imp\u00f4ts de la ville de Seattle au profit de ses d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et centres de donn\u00e9es. En 2018, le pionnier du commerce en ligne avait lanc\u00e9 une comp\u00e9tition nationale d\u00e9sormais c\u00e9l\u00e8bre pour d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 implanter son deuxi\u00e8me si\u00e8ge social, mettant les maires et gouverneurs en concurrence pour savoir lesquels offriraient le plus de carottes fiscales \u00e0 une entreprise valoris\u00e9e \u00e0 1 trillion de dollars et enregistrant 12,4 milliards de dollars de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices op\u00e9rationnels cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Pareillement, sur la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, l'\u00e9tat de Californie a contribu\u00e9 plusieurs milliards de dollars d'aides aux ambitions d'Elon Musk pour Tesla, SolarCity et SpaceX. C'est Deng Xiaoping qui mit en place les r\u00e9formes n\u00e9cessaires dans les ann\u00e9es 1980 en permettant l'essor de Zones \u00c9conomiques Sp\u00e9ciales partiellement d\u00e9fiscalis\u00e9es. Depuis lors, la Chine d\u00e9veloppe son \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me en contr\u00f4lant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses march\u00e9s tout comme, au 19e si\u00e8cle, les \u00c9tats-Unis prot\u00e9geaient les leurs des produits europ\u00e9ens. Les tarifs McKinley, fix\u00e9s \u00e0 49.5% et introduits en 1890, avaient eu un tel impact qu'ils furent m\u00eame baptis\u00e9s le \"Napol\u00e9on de la protection.\" Restrictions douani\u00e8res - anath\u00e8me des partisans de la globalisation - et g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses subventions ont donc permis aux jeunes pousses chinoises d'asseoir leur pr\u00e9dominance dans plusieurs activit\u00e9s. Alibaba, \u00e0 l'origine un simple ersatz d'Amazon, poss\u00e8de par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'Ant Financial l'un des principaux modes de paiement \u00e9lectronique dans le monde: Alipay. Le laiss\u00e9-pour-compte En somme, la Chine a su imposer son capitalisme d'\u00c9tat comme alternative \u00e0 la version plus sauvage, mais consid\u00e9rablement assist\u00e9e, d'outre-Atlantique. Aujourd'hui, parmi les dix plus grosses capitalisations mondiales du secteur technologique, six sont am\u00e9ricaines et quatre asiatiques, dont deux chinoises. Cela signifie que le destin industriel de l'Europe ne lui appartient plus. L'erreur commise, c'est de n'avoir pas remarqu\u00e9 combien la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique n\u00e9cessiterait des besoins en financement colossaux. Les dix principales firmes Tech de l'Union europ\u00e9enne justifient d'une valeur boursi\u00e8re \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 8% de leurs homologues am\u00e9ricains, alors qu'apr\u00e8s l'IPO imminente d'Ant Financial le top 10 chinois en repr\u00e9sentera environ un quart. Le Royaume-Uni, incessamment lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du carcan de Bruxelles et plein d'espoir de reconqu\u00eate, voit ses dix \"champions\" peser moins d'un centi\u00e8me des g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains. Loin des places boursi\u00e8res, l'Europe ne compte aucune d\u00e9cacorne (startup non cot\u00e9e, financ\u00e9e par du capital-risque, d'une valeur d'au moins 10 milliards de dollars) quand l'Am\u00e9rique en compte onze et la Chine six, y compris Bytedance, valoris\u00e9 \u00e0 140 milliards de dollars et propri\u00e9taire de TikTok, l'appli qualifi\u00e9e par Donald Trump de cybermenace. L'apr\u00e8s-Brexit s'annonce douloureux. Le mod\u00e8le chinois d\u00e9montre que la meilleure (la seule?) mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9fier les \u00c9tats-Unis, c'est d'adopter une politique de coordination exemplaire et de d\u00e9fendre son territoire. Les Britanniques, grands pr\u00eatres du lib\u00e9ralisme \u00e9conomique depuis Adam Smith, ont r\u00e9cemment pris conscience du danger et pr\u00e9parent un projet de loi pour prot\u00e9ger leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s technologiques des pr\u00e9dateurs \u00e9trangers. \u00c0 voir si cette ligne de conduite fera des \u00e9mules. Cela irait bien \u00e9videmment \u00e0 l'encontre des conditions vues comme sine qua non au bon fonctionnement du capitalisme, telle que l'\u00e9limination de toute entrave r\u00e9gulatrice. Hors, ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 largement d\u00e9r\u00e9glement\u00e9 leur \u00e9conomie, les \u00c9tats-Unis sont imbattables aux jeux du laisser-faire et de la prise de risque; une attitude qui contraste profond\u00e9ment avec l'id\u00e9ologie socio-lib\u00e9rale et paternaliste de nombreux pays europ\u00e9ens. Un r\u00f4le subalterne Alors que les \u00c9tats-Unis et la Chine se chamaillent \u00e0 coups de mesures protectionnistes, l'enjeu est devenu primordial. Si l'Europe souhaite pr\u00e9server sa souverainet\u00e9, entrepreneurs, investisseurs et instances f\u00e9d\u00e9rales doivent s'organiser sur un plan r\u00e9ellement supranational. Malheureusement, le plan de relance sign\u00e9 en juillet fait peu de place aux technologies. Sans sombrer dans le dirigisme \u00e9conomique, ce f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme requi\u00e8re une politique commune de barri\u00e8res \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e et d'aides publiques \u00e0 l'innovation et \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'entreprises au sein de technopoles \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle continentale. Car si elle ne parvient pas \u00e0 parer les GAFAM et autres BAT, l'Europe se verra cantonn\u00e9e dans trois fonctions accessoires :</p><p>1/ Celle de sous-traitant, non pas pour produire \u00e0 bon march\u00e9, mais pour adapter les technologies \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux exigences locales; 2/ Celle de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 commercial, laissant les firmes am\u00e9ricaines et chinoises tirer profit de consommateurs sans substituts; 3/ Celle de mati\u00e8re premi\u00e8re, soit pour permettre aux innovateurs \u00e9trangers de d\u00e9pouiller les donn\u00e9es personnelles des utilisateurs europ\u00e9ens, soit pour voir les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de pointe du continent en mal de capitaux servir de cibles d'acquisition. Bient\u00f4t le probl\u00e8me ne sera pas tant que, dans ce match de boxe, l'Europe est dans les cordes; notre continent sera tout bonnement hors du ring, observant les superwelters am\u00e9ricains et chinois se battre pour le titre de premi\u00e8re puissance technologique du 21e si\u00e8cle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRIBFR-ltw856150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TDAS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-MB01-F12R-V2F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>2:09 PM CET</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 La Tribune Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>La Tribune.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61675\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Vendredi 4 Septembre 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Pocos son los que entienden por qu\u00e9 las acciones de la banca espa\u00f1ola, y sobre todo las de CaixaBank y Banco Sabadell, han estado tan castigadas tras la presentaci\u00f3n de sus resultados. Un conocido banquero de banca comercial aseguraba estar desconcertado con la ca\u00edda en Bolsa de ambas entidades financieras. \u201cSus resultados no son tan malos. </p><p>Adem\u00e1s, en el caso de Banco Sabadell el efecto negativo de TSB ya se conoc\u00eda desde los trimestres anteriores, con lo que no hab\u00eda sorpresa. Adem\u00e1s, el banco ya ha dado por cerrado este problema y ya ha saneado su cartera inmobiliaria, casi de un tir\u00f3n. No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 analizando el mercado, a lo mejor las perspectivas de futuro, en las que se me escapa algo\u201d, reflexionaba este conocido banquero, que de ser algo de Sabadell es su rival porque operan en el mismo nicho de mercado. Credit Suisse tambi\u00e9n considera injustificado el castigo en Bolsa de la banca espa\u00f1ola, ya que el hecho de que el BCE retrase la subida de tipos de inter\u00e9s que tanto beneficiar\u00eda a los m\u00e1rgenes de estas entidades ya est\u00e1 incluido en sus actuales valoraciones, por lo que no est\u00e1n justificadas nuevas ca\u00eddas. El \u00faltimo informe de este banco suizo analiza los resultados de CaixaBank, Banco Sabadell y Bankia, los tres dom\u00e9sticos m\u00e1s castigados.  Sea como sea, la banca parece que desde hace una d\u00e9cada no levanta cabeza, aunque su situaci\u00f3n financiera actual nada tiene que ver con el azote de la crisis. Su rentabilidad sigue siendo muy baja, salvo excepciones. Pero tambi\u00e9n es cierto que, en general, el sector bancario en Europa es igual o menos rentable. Cambiando de asunto.  Tambi\u00e9n son pocos los que entienden que est\u00e1 pasando con el proyecto de<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> sandbox </emphasis>(literalmente, caja de arena) que ten\u00eda previsto aprobar el Gobierno el pasado a\u00f1o y del que desde hace alg\u00fan mes no se ha vuelto a saber nada. Era uno de los proyectos estrella de la agenda del Gobierno espa\u00f1ol, tanto del PP como del PSOE. Espa\u00f1a se iba a convertir en uno de los Estados pioneros en Europa y casi del mundo en la implantaci\u00f3n de un espacio controlado de pruebas para realizar proyectos de innovaci\u00f3n financiera de base tecnol\u00f3gica sin riesgo regulatorio.   Cuando el Gobierno del PP empez\u00f3 a hablar de crear un<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> sandbox </emphasis>en Espa\u00f1a solo en Europa el \u00fanico pa\u00eds que contaba con uno era Reino Unido. Ahora, Espa\u00f1a ha perdido esa oportunidad de estar en la lista de pioneros. Dinamarca, Holanda, Polonia y Lituania, adem\u00e1s, claro, de Reino Unido cuentan ya con este laboratorio tecnol\u00f3gico financiero.  Lo que sorprende es que, pese a que todos los expertos consideran que el<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> sandbox </emphasis>es necesario si se quiere ser un pa\u00eds puntero en innovaci\u00f3n, la Comisi\u00f3n Europea no lo ha incluido en su agenda para crear un espacio de pruebas tecnol\u00f3gicas financieras, algo sorprendente si se quiere coger el tren de la innovaci\u00f3n antes de que pase de estaci\u00f3n.  La justificaci\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n es que quiere, antes de ponerse a ello, analizar las experiencias nacionales. En fin, as\u00ed en Europa parece que cada uno va a lo suyo. Hace unas semanas hab\u00eda corrido el bulo de que el Gobierno de Pedro S\u00e1nchez hab\u00eda ralentizado la aprobaci\u00f3n y puesta en marcha del<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> sandbox </emphasis>porque Podemos no lo ve\u00eda nada claro. No le gustaba que se desarrollase un proyecto en el que se dejara libertad a la banca para que experimentara. Pero nada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad. Fuentes de Podemos han reconocido a CincoD\u00edas que el proyecto inicialmente les parece muy bueno. \u201cNos gusta la propuesta. Habr\u00e1 que ver la propuesta final, pero inicialmente nos gusta\u201d, explican fuentes de este partido pol\u00edtico. De momento, el jueves Cecabank celebrar\u00e1 unas jornadas sobre<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> sandbox </emphasis>el pr\u00f3ximo d\u00eda 14. Entonces puede que se despejen algunas dudas.  Tambi\u00e9n quedan por despejar muchas dudas sobre la PSD2 o norma sobre pagos, otro de los puntos destacados de la agenda del Gobierno hace unos meses. Esta normativa supone una aut\u00e9ntica revoluci\u00f3n para la banca ya que tendr\u00e1 que admitir la cesi\u00f3n a un tercero de los datos de un cliente si este as\u00ed lo desea. Los bancos a\u00fan luchan por que las exigencias que les imponen los reguladores a ellos se apliquen tambi\u00e9n a estos nuevos actores financieros como las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech  </emphasis>(Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., etc., etc.). Un ejecutivo de una destacada entidad asegura que \u201cla PSD2 es un gol por toda la escuadra que han metido las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas a la banca y el BCE no solo no lo ha visto, sino que encima lo apoya en defensa del consumidor, dice. Pero entonces por qu\u00e9 no se imponen las mismas reglas de juego para todos si se va a operar en la misma actividad\u201d. De momento, parece que la banca tiene la batalla perdida. El problema de fondo es que en unos a\u00f1os la banca puede que se quede solo con el negocio financiero no rentable, el de custodiar los dep\u00f3sitos, o el de m\u00e1s riesgo, como el de la financiaci\u00f3n a empresas, por ejemplo. Mientras que la actividad de gesti\u00f3n de tarjetas, cr\u00e9ditos al consumo o gesti\u00f3n de otros activos estar\u00e1 en manos de las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech</emphasis>, que es verdaderamente la parte mollar de los beneficios de la banca. Por cierto, Kenneth Rogoff, profesor de Econom\u00eda y Pol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas en la Universidad de Harvard y ganador del Premio Deutsche Bank 2011 en Econom\u00eda Financiera, vaticina una nueva crisis. Asegura en un art\u00edculo publicado en Project Syndicate (organizaci\u00f3n internacional de medios que publica y re\u00fane comentarios y an\u00e1lisis sobre una variedad de temas globales importantes) que \u201ca pesar de las mejoras en el sistema financiero desde la crisis de 2008, las reformas parciales que se han promulgado no son suficientes para lo que se necesita. Y un sistema financiero que crece de manera inexorable, combinado con un entorno pol\u00edtico cada vez m\u00e1s t\u00f3xico, significa que la pr\u00f3xima gran crisis financiera puede llegar antes de lo que cree\u201d.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINCOD-712909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINCOD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD4-HVR1-F12V-S35D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Estructura, Grupo De Estudios Economicos, S.A.

It's impossible to predict the future, but we know that our clients are facing an increasingly challenging environment that requires strong partnership and innovative solutions that come from putting patients front and center. That's where our focus is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Agencies now compete against the likes of Google, IBM, and big consultancies. How have you shifted strategies to win new business and retain top people?</emphasis><br/><br/> Our priority is providing differentiated value and partnership for clients. We must take a future-oriented view toward clients' needs and be laser-focused on helping them solve the critical business challenges they face today and will face tomorrow. We are transforming our business around data and technology and helping our clients do the same. Our people are our most important asset, and our focus is on recruiting diversified talent and helping them to pursue their dreams.</p><h>Donna Murphy, global CEO, Havas Health &amp; You</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 1) How does the broader remit of \"health,\" as evidenced by developments at today's holding companies, help in appealing to clients and making services more accessible? </emphasis></p><p>For us, it's not just \"health,\" but rather \"health and wellness.\" We know that they do not exist in isolation - they live along a continuum. Our Havas Health &amp; You positioning puts us at the intersection of healthy and living. We can pull through all of Havas' health-and-wellness offerings and our thousands of experts. We can serve as change agents for our health-and-wellness clients, using creativity, media, and innovation to inspire healthier lives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. What impact did the political and economic uncertainty of late 2016 have on budgets last year and this year? How will the Trump administration's policies play out in 2017? </emphasis></p><p>The political landscape did not significantly impact budgets in 2016 as far as we could see. So we don't expect any notable changes in 2017, either.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Agencies now compete against the likes of Google, IBM, and big consultancies. How have you shifted strategies to win new business and retain top people?</emphasis></p><p>Our strategies have not shifted. They have only accelerated in terms of execution and importance in recognition of need and market opportunity. One of our cultural pillars is to be entrepreneurial and to prototype new ideas that bring value for our clients. This has been central to our success in driving long-term client relationships and winning new business. It has also been a major driver of finding and retaining top talent.</p><h>Ed Wise, CEO, Omnicom Health Group </h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1) How does the broader remit of \"health,\" as evidenced by developments at today's holding companies, help in appealing to clients and making services more accessible?</emphasis></p><p>There's nothing new about health-specific agencies. The appreciation for what it takes to be a dedicated health specialist is clearer than ever. As many agency brands with a generalist heritage stake a claim in healthcare communications, it's important to let clients know that ours are specialty companies. That means these entities are not dabbling in healthcare, but are dedicated units with all the specialty knowledge and experience required to manage high-science healthcare brands and their complex communications challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. What impact did the political and economic uncertainty of late 2016 have on budgets last year and this year? How will the Trump administration's policies play out in 2017?</emphasis></p><p>Positive signals out of Washington include a clear U.S. innovation agenda and the promise of favorable tax code changes, which may drive domestic investment and manufacturing. Drugmakers will continue to undergo M&amp;A as a way to improve pipelines and hone strategic portfolios, in some cases retaining cash and driving harder supplier negotiations. Drug approvals may also accelerate. Even in the face of disruption, company budgets have not been slashed. That said, if uncertainty will be the one thing we can be certain about, we remain dedicated to an agile posture as the next few years unfold.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Agencies now compete against the likes of Google, IBM, and big consultancies. How have you shifted strategies to win new business and retain top people?</emphasis></p><p>As healthcare and tech converge, we are not so much competing as partnering with big tech to bring clients the best solutions - and, with one of the leading consultancies, to produce new research on the shift to value. We bring our healthcare communication and regulatory expertise to the table while putting tech at the center of our companies, leveraging our scale to create data-driven products. This agenda even shapes our acquisition strategy. Last year, for example, we acquired BioPharm, a data-driven multichannel agency, and Carson Analytics, its advanced analytics partner.</p><h>Helene Yan, VP, business strategy, Interpublic Group</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1) How does the broader remit of \"health,\" as evidenced by developments at today's holding companies, help in appealing to clients and making services more accessible?</emphasis></p><p>\"Healthcare\" is often viewed as the province of physicians, hospitals, and payers along with patients, caregivers, and medicines. However, our responsibility, and our clients' impact, is continuous - it doesn't end after someone is discharged or completes a medication regimen. Healthcare is delivered; health is experienced. Health - or more broadly, wellness - is fundamental: It is a focus on wholeness and acknowledges that prevention can be more important than cure. Shifting attention from improving healthcare to improving health is a springboard to explore new avenues for support, engagement, and care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. What impact did the political and economic uncertainty of late 2016 have on budgets last year and this year? How will the Trump administration's policies play out in 2017?</emphasis></p><p>We did not see a major impact on budgets. Yes, there was uncertainty, but uncertainty and change are constants. The ACA has been a hot topic for almost a decade. M&amp;A activity is especially high in pharma worldwide. At the same time, client budgets continue to be driven by company or brand-specific priorities rather than macro forces. So while we're watching the social, political, and economic landscape closely, we - and our clients - are not letting it distract us. We expect a continued good business outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Agencies now compete against the likes of Google, IBM, and big consultancies. How have you shifted strategies to win new business and retain top people?</emphasis></p><p>We've always competed against tech and consultancies. Creativity is at the heart of what we do and is not replicable. We'll always be a place for people who want to create and execute life-enhancing ideas. You'll see our strategic and technological firepower more clearly in the work we deliver across agencies, such as the launch of Consulting at McCann Health. Far-reaching policies, such as FCB Health's allocating unbillable time to \"what if\" thinking, also ultimately benefit clients.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/100-agencies-main-page/article/668113/\">Back to the 2017 Top 100 Agencies</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MMMHUS-668312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MMMHUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P0B-3171-JDRS-71XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Haymarket Media.

Who knows how much longer it'll be? Will the company's thought police come for me next? How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.</p><p>First, some background:</p><p>Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that \"after careful consideration,\" the financial institution could \"no longer support\" his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.</p><p>Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back:</p><p>\"Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.\"</p><p>I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. \"So if not for political reasons,\" I asked, \"why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?\" The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: \"For privacy reasons, we can't say more.\"</p><p>Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:</p><p>One Chase employee blamed \"clerical\" issues on Tarrio's account cancellation.</p><p>Another stated: \"I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.\"</p><p>Another explained: \"Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.\" Those with \"no moral character\" are people that \"the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any \"business relationships, period.\"</p><p>Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: \"Decision is not reversible.\"</p><p>Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals \"clerical\" errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a \"moral character\" assessment?</p><p>More questions arise:</p><p>How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use?</p><p>Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to \"destroy\" its political enemies on the right?</p><p>What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?</p><p>Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms?</p><p>Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter forBigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws -- even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that \"violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.\"</p><p>Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: \"First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.\"</p><p>He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: \"To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram. I've committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.\"</p><p>As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.</p><p>Evasion and denial are surefire ways to lose business. Is it Chase Bank or Chase AWAY Bank?

Who knows how much longer it'll be? Will the company's thought police come for me next? How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.R Morgan Chase &amp; Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.</p><p> First, some background:</p><p> Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that \"after careful consideration,\" the financial institution could \"no longer support\" his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.</p><p> Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back:</p><p> \"Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.\"</p><p> I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. \"So if not for political reasons,\" I asked, \"why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?\" The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: \"For privacy reasons, we can't say more.\"</p><p> Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:</p><p> - One Chase employee blamed</p><p> \"clerical\" issues on Tarrio's account cancellation. - Another stated: \"I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.\" Another explained: \"Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.\" Those with \"no moral character\" are people that \"the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any \"business relationships, period.\"</p><p> -Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: \"Decision is not reversible.\"</p><p> Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Mar-kota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals \"clerical\" errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a \"moral character\" assessment? More questions arise: How exactly is J.R Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use?</p><p> Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to \"destroy\" its political enemies on the right?</p><p> What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?</p><p> Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms? Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws - even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that \"violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.\"</p><p> Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: \"First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.\"</p><p> He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: \"To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Face-book and Instagram. I've committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.\"</p><p> As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.</p><p> Evasion and denial are surefire ways to lose business. Is it Chase Bank or Chase (SET ITAL)Away(END ITAL) Bank? Inquiring customers would like to know.</p><p> Michelle Malkin's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:writemalkin@gmail.com\">writemalkin@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-ff7fcd5c9ed703773f968dfcf98bcf2c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B0A38BDF88A NWBKLA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYG-D431-DXVP-V54V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Crowley Post-Signal, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Who knows how much longer it'll be? Will the company's thought police come for me next?</p><p> How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase ...., you need to ask questions and get answers. On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.First, some background:Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that 'after careful consideration,' the financial institution could 'no longer support' his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine. Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back: 'Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.' I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. 'So if not for political reasons,' I asked, 'why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?' The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: 'For privacy reasons, we can't say more.' Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how: One Chase employee blamed 'clerical' issues on Tarrio's account cancellation. Another stated: 'I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.' Another explained: 'Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.' Those with 'no moral character' are people that 'the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any 'business relationships, period.' Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: 'Decision is not reversible.' Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals 'clerical' errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a 'moral character' assessment?More questions arise:How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use? Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to 'destroy' its political enemies on the right? What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace? Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms? Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws \u2014 even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: 'First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.' He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: 'To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram. I've committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.' As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report. Evasion and denial are surefire ways to lose business. Is it Chase Bank or Chase Away Bank? Inquiring customers would like to know.About Michelle Malkin Michelle Malkin is host of 'Michelle Malkin Investigates' onCRTV.com[2].

Who knows how much longer it'll be? Will the company's thought police come for me next? How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.</p><p>First, some background:</p><p>Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that \"after careful consideration,\" the financial institution could \"no longer support\" his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.</p><p>Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back:</p><p>\"Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.\"</p><p>I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. \"So if not for political reasons,\" I asked, \"why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?\" The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: \"For privacy reasons, we can't say more.\"</p><p>Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:</p><p> One Chase employee blamed \"clerical\" issues on Tarrio's account cancellation.</p><p> Another stated: \"I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.\"</p><p> Another explained: \"Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.\" Those with \"no moral character\" are people that \"the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any \"business relationships, period.\"</p><p> Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: \"Decision is not reversible.\"</p><p>Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals \"clerical\" errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a \"moral character\" assessment?</p><p>More questions arise:</p><p>How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use?</p><p>Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to \"destroy\" its political enemies on the right?</p><p>What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?</p><p>Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms?</p><p>Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws   even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that \"violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.\"</p><p>Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: \"First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.\"</p><p>He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: \"To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram. I've committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.\"</p><p>As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.</p><p>Evasion and denial are surefire ways to lose business.

Who knows how much longer it'll be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will the company's thought police come for me next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> How about you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.</p><p> First, some background: Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that \"after careful consideration,\" the financial institution could \"no longer support\" his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.</p><p> Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts.</p><p> When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back: \"Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.\"</p><p> I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. \"So if not for political reasons,\" I asked, \"why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?\" The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: \"For privacy reasons, we can't say more.\"</p><p> Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:</p><p> - One Chase employee blamed \"clerical\" issues on Tarrio's account cancellation.</p><p> - Another stated: \"I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.\"</p><p> - Another explained: \"Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.\"</p><p> Those with \"no moral character\" are people that \"the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any \"business relationships, period.\"</p><p> - Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: \"Decision is not reversible.\"</p><p> Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals \"clerical\" errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a \"moral character\" assessment?</p><p> More questions arise: How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use?</p><p> Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to \"destroy\" its political enemies on the right?</p><p> What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?</p><p> Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms?</p><p> Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC?</p><p> One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws - even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that \"violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.\"</p><p> Tarrio warns of the speech squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: \"First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked.</p><p> It's a very dangerous trend.\"</p><p> He is not alone.

Who knows how much longer it'll be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will the company's thought police come for me next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> How about you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If you are a nonleftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated.</p><p> First, some background: Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that \"after careful consideration,\" the financial institution could \"no longer support\" his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.</p><p> Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back: \"Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.\" I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account.</p><p> \"So if not for political reasons,\" I asked, \"why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?\" The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: \"For privacy reasons, we can't say more.\" Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:</p><p> \u00b7 One Chase employee blamed \"clerical\" issues on Tarrio's account cancellation.</p><p> \u00b7 Another stated: \"I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.\"</p><p> \u00b7 Another explained: \"Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.\" Those with \"no moral character\" are people that \"the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any \"business relationships, period.\"</p><p> \u00b7 Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: \"Decision is not reversible.\" Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals \"clerical\" errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a \"moral character\" assessment?</p><p> More questions arise: How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC leftwing operatives being put to use?</p><p> Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to \"destroy\" its political enemies on the right?</p><p> What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?</p><p> Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms?</p><p> Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC?</p><p> One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeague-Politics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws - even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that \"violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.\" Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: \"First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.\" He is not alone.</p><p> Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: \"To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram.</p><p> I've committed no crime!</p><p> My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table.</p><p> The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.\" As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.</p><p> Evasion and denial are surefire ways to lose business. Is it Chase Bank or Chase Away Bank?</p><p> Inquiring customers would like to know.</p><p> Michelle Malkin's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:writemalkin@gmail.com\">writemalkin@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-4f45f093d71a589b3a3295f3c20a39a7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898F9F93273B5 NWBKOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYC-RFS1-JBCN-4359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"920\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a Bartlesville Examiner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, October 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus driving markets this morning. The morning under pressure after missing (INAUDIBLE) and revenue estimates, also cutting its full year guidance. Stock down four and three-quarters percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Boeing 737 Max crisis and the company's bottom line coming up. The embattled aerospace giant Boeing reporting earnings in about 30 minutes. We will have those numbers and get you the full analysis as well.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat this morning. The Facebook CEO to defend his proposed cryptocurrency, testifying on Capitol Hill later today, ready to admit the social giant has trust issues. We'll take a look at what to expect as Facebook shares are down a fraction this morning.</p><p>Broader markets meanwhile look like this. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading thanks to Caterpillar largely. Caterpillar will cut about 60 points off the Dow this morning. Yesterday's uncertainty and, of course, Brexit also an issue. But the Dow this morning down 89 points. The S&amp;P was down 6 on top of yesterday's declines.</p><p>S&amp;P was down 10 points yesterday at the close. The Dow was down 39 points. And the Nasdaq lower by 58. By the way, the S&amp;P is still about 1 percent away from an all-time high.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are mixed. FT 100 is up 7 points as the Brexit drama continues. Parliament approving Prime Minister Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement but not agreeing to his speedy timetable. Now it is up to the E.U. to allow an extension.</p><p>CAC 40 in Paris is down 37. The DAX index in Germany down 7 points.</p><p>There are growing concerns over Hong Kong putting pressure on markets in Asia overnight. Take a look. Nikkei in Japan able to finish with slight gains. But the others down as you see there. Hang Seng in Hong Kong down almost 1 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; National Securities Corporation chief market strategist Art Hogan; and Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES CORPORATION: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're waiting on a number of earnings which will likely impact markets but Caterpillar's the story of the day and so far stock is down on this earnings miss because I guess it is an indicator of the global economy.</p><p>HOGAN: Sure, it's an indicator of a part of the global economy that we've known has been slow for a while. For manufacturing, when you talk about what's going on in the world, yes we know there's a slowdown. Where is it getting hurt the most and it's manufacturing.</p><p>And whether we look at manufacturing because of Boeing not delivering the 737 Max or General Motors being in a 30-day strike or just the, you know, the slower activity that we're seeing in general.</p><p>Also remember Caterpillar is affected by what's going on in minerals and mining. All the commodity production that's going on globally and we know that has slowed too. So Caterpillar's the tip of the sword for what we see as global economic slowdown.</p><p>But to Dagen's point, a lot of this are priced in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOGAN: I mean the S&amp;P 500 is up about 20 percent, it's up 8 percent on year-to-date basis. So we're always -- I'm always surprised by how much we're surprised. But I'm also -- I'm still shocked that Cat didn't come out at some juncture and say hey listen, we've got to (INAUDIBLE) or at least take our guidance down so they wouldn't have this disappointment on earnings day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's off of the lows. The Morgan Stanley analysts this morning telling clients there's a slight earnings recession going on at Caterpillar.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No, the quote from the CEO was our volumes declined as dealers reduced their inventories, and end-user demand while positive was lower than our expectations.</p><p>But overall, the earnings are way down from a year ago, down 13 and-a-half percent from a year ago. So not only is it a miss but it's a double-digit decline in earnings. And then also cutting its full year outlook and total sales and revenue off by 5.6 percent from a year ago. So it's red.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're watching that one.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this hour is keeping big tech in check. Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is going to be testifying on Capitol Hill later today in front of the House Financial Services Committee. He is expected to face questions on Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra and whether the public can trust the embattled tech giant to handle users' finances.</p><p>In his opening statement, Zuckerberg argues if American technology companies do not take the lead on digital currencies other countries will.</p><p>Here's what he says. It reads in part -- this is the opening statement this morning -- \"If healthy skepticism becomes all out hostility, we'll put a lot of progress at risk, not just in the world where American technology companies have an opportunity to champion American values. I think it would be bad for our country and the world if companies were discouraged from taking on challenges like these and settled for safer options that reinforce the status quo. That would harm our national reputation\", he says, \"for innovation, make our economy less competitive and end up concentrating more power in the hands of existing players rather than people.\"</p><p>We're going to talk about that, get your reaction to that.</p><p>HOGAN: Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Texas Congressman, Financial Services Committee member Roger Williams. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R-TX): Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to the opening statement?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I'm anxious to hear what he has to say. You know, I mean I think America should lead the way in innovation and I'm all for that. I'm kind of an old school guy. I'm a Main Street business guy.</p><p>But I want to hear what he has to say. And let's assume too that the private sector can do things great. We know they can. So let's see -- let's see what he talks about and let's see where he thinks he can take this thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how come it took them so long to admit that they were breaching our privacy and selling our information to advertisers? I mean can we trust them on cryptocurrency after what we've just been through in terms of privacy?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well that's going to be something to ask him. I mean, you know, they didn't say anything until they had to say something. And this is important when you're talking about cryptocurrency. I'm still a dollar- bill guy.</p><p>And I want to know are the consumers going to be protected. How is it going to work for Main Street America? How is it going to work for a business like I have? I sit going to make things easier, harder or whatever? And can I trust them?</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: Hi, Congressman. This is Omeed Malik.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hey -- Omeed.</p><p>MALIK: I would just say that if you think about why are they getting into this business -- that's the first question to ask. And that is so they can track the spending behavior of the American citizen. And he's going to use China as a boogeyman.</p><p>The difference is that the Chinese government is the one who is doing this, not a private corporation. So I certainly agree that you want innovation out of the private sector but to what end?</p><p>Look at all the different businesses they're in and all seems in order to track citizens. If they're going to get into a currency sector, they need to be regulated to the full extent just like a bank would in some cases. And so I hope to the extent that our congressmen are speaking about this, that we're going to actually have it be regulated because this is a company that has shown bad faith in the past and continues to expand in area after area and swallows up any innovation. And it's also a monopoly.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. I mean I agree with what you're saying. That's what we're going to have to talk out about today and learn more about it. The transparency is going to have to be important -- to protect the consumer, it's going to have to be important. And I mean that's the bottom line, that's what we do here.</p><p>And as a small business person, I want to make sure that I'm protected. And those are the things he's going to have to answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I like that. That's a good question. Is it just to track everybody, to see what they're spending their money on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Omeed -- I'm going to ask you a question. How many people with respect, Congressman -- how many people in Washington really understand how Facebook's business works? Because it's vast.</p><p>And again, when Mark Zuckerberg first appeared on Capitol Hill he was very, very prepared in terms of rehearsed by -- well-rehearsed by his legal team.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he was very focused and very respectful. But I don't -- the questions didn't really get to the bottom of what Facebook has been up to literally for the last 12 years or so.</p><p>MALIK: Dagen -- it's such an important point. Many of the senators that asked him question didn't even know that Facebook was a free service. And as a result they didn't understand how he was making money. They didn't even know that it's from the advertisers.</p><p>So if you don't understand the fundamental business purpose and how they're actually -- their earnings are generated, how are you going to begin to regulate it? And instead of allowing them to get into more and more areas, this can be very dangerous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching this hearing. Go ahead -- Congressman. Real quick.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I was going to say Dagen -- you asked a good question. How many congress people, I mean, the truth of the matter is, very few. And I don't include myself to be all-knowing. I'm still learning this. We have to ask the questions.</p><p>But the problem is sometimes more people, our peers as you know think they know more than they know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And that's why this hearing is important and maybe those to follow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, take that question to your colleagues that Omeed just gave you. You know, why are they getting into this business? Do they want to just track everybody and what they're spending.</p><p>Real quick on the push for impeachment, Congressman -- the top American diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor testified yesterday that President Trump did in fact use aid as an incentive for Ukraine to investigate the Biden family in the 2016 election. Of course then, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe question, quote, \"destroyed Taylor's argument\".</p><p>Do you have any sense of what went down yesterday? And is the public ever going to get a look behind the curtain here in this impeachment inquiry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. They've been really secret about it. It's not even in the right committee. I know I was in my district last week with the President to open a Louis Vuitton plant in central Texas. And people back home are following it, but it's not important.</p><p>But I think it's -- nothing is stuck on the president. It's their only way to think they can win in 2022 -- or 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And it's phony is the bottom line. We've got to get through this. And we've got an election coming up in November and let's let the voters decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Well, I think it's interesting -- Congressman, that because Taylor had in his opening statement suggestions that there was a quid pro quo, they released his opening statement. Nothing else was released in particular, the questioning by John Ratcliffe which blew a hole in that completely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The House Democrats are essentially auditioning players for what will be a public Christmas pageant -- a holiday pageant of the impeachment proceedings. They're trying to find the best voices to push this message on the American people. So all this is being done in secret. The Republican congressmen aren't even given transcripts of these interviews or depositions.</p><p>They have to go in and read the transcript with a Democratic staffer standing next to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They've got a minder.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's unprecedented. Never seen --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what? It's not an impeachment proceeding. They haven't voted on it. It's not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it's not formal. It's not formal in the way that it was with Clinton and with Richard Nixon. Again, they're not treating this with the seriousness and the severity that it is when you're trying to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they don't have the vote and they also don't have a story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Really quickly. There was a CNN report that the number of people in favor of impeachment and removal from office has gone up. It's at 50 percent. But if you look at Republicans, the number of people saying yes to that impeachment and removal from office has fallen dramatically. It's only 6 percent of Republicans right now. So support for the President among his base is actually improving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I don't see any credibility on the Democrats' side until they focus on the real wrongdoing in 2016. I want to see accountability.</p><p>Congressman -- it's good to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Ok. Good to see you, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Roger Williams joining us there.</p><p>Caterpillar, we told you, missed on the third quarter earnings report this morning. It's also lowering its full year guidance.</p><p>Joining us right now by phone is Tigress Financial Partners chief investment officer Ivan Feinseth. Ivan -- thanks very much for calling in. Your reaction to the Caterpillar quarter and what it tells us about the global economy.</p><p>IVAN FEINSETH, TIGRESS FINANCIAL PARTNERS (via telephone): Well, they do, are experiencing a headwind from slowing global growth, that is mostly trade tariff driven. And when I -- we're moving closer to some type of trade deal with China. I think once that is overcome, I think the shares will snap back.</p><p>So I think this is a buying opportunity because global construction demand continues to increase, especially for infrastructure, both in the U.S. and in other countries.</p><p>And they do have some other drivers of revenue including their Cloud- connected platform that they are very technology advanced company. And they are buying back stock at a significant rate and the stock does have an over 3 percent dividend yield.</p><p>So I still view this weakness as a buying opportunity and we look to some correction once the tariffs are overcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is exactly what Omeed said. In fact, had I bought - - when you said it, when the stock was down 6 percent I would have already made money. It's still off of the lows, Omeed -- down 3.9 percent right now.</p><p>MALIK: Yes. I couldn't agree more. This, like so many of other names, I love what you said about that acronym about all the ones affected by the trade deal -- you're making a macroeconomic play less than a fundamental one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And is this pretty much priced in -- Ivan? The fact that they took their estimates down? What should we look toward in terms of next move in this stock, do you think? Do you think this is the low that we've seen so far?</p><p>SEINFEITH: Well, I think when companies are going to lower expectations, they do become very conservative, to hope that business does pick up and then they can exceed the expectations over the next few quarters.</p><p>So I think that they have been conservative throughout this whole tariff issue in the past year-and-a-half. And that has been weighing on the stock for some time. But they are the dominant construction machine producer globally with the most brand equity and I think when stocks are struggling, it's time to -- when stocks struggle, it's time to buy it. And when we see demand pick up I think they will be a significant beneficiary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there.</p><p>Ivan -- thanks very much for calling in. We appreciate it. Ivan Feinseth joining us there from Tigress.</p><p>Coming up, investors are watching Boeing as well, the company's third quarter earnings out in about 30 minutes. We'll have those numbers after this break.</p><p>And then Pizza Hut's meatless play -- its the unique sausage pie could trick your taste buds. We're going to check it out.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Actress Lori Loughlin and ten other parents facing new charges in the massive college at admissions scandal this morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria.</p><p>So prosecutors say that those parents have been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery. They are accused of attempting to buy off officials at an organization that receives federal funding. The charge carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p><p>Jeff Bezos putting together an all-star team to build a lunar lander for his company Blue Origin. The contractors which include Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman and Draper will build a spacecraft to take NASA astronauts to the moon as soon as 2024.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: This is the only way to get back to the moon fast and this time we're going back to the moon and we're not going to back to the moon to visit. We're going back to the moon to stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, the system is being built for NASA's Artemis program.</p><p>And then finally this. Pizza Hut taking a bite of the plant-based meat fad. They are testing just for today a garden specialty pizza that's topped with \"incogmeato\" Italian sausage.</p><p>So incogmeato is made by Morning Star farms. Kellogg owns that company, by the way. The Pizza-hut tryout is being held tomorrow only at one Pizza Hut location in Phoenix near Scottsdale, if anybody is watching from there.</p><p>Pizza Hut is also testing a round pizza box guys, they claim will keep the pizza hot. You all have it on set. Enjoy, as I give you some more details about it. The round box is compostable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So it looks like this.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You take the top off.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's got a natural base that your pizza locks in. And it's like -- guess who made it. I didn't mean to interrupt you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: No, that's ok. But about the pizza -- so you all try it or somebody try it because I can't. I'm over here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They made me try it.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>CASONE: It's not meat. It's plant-based meat.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not eating the cheese on it.</p><p>CASONE: It's not vegan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. But the fake -- sorry, the fake sausage is vegan. It's just the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Art -- you took a bite. Tell us.</p><p>MALIK: How is it?</p><p>HOGAN: It's fantastic. It's really good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you kidding me?</p><p>HOGAN: And it's really hot, too still which is amazing. But that's part of the -- you see how this box is made?</p><p>CASONE: Yes. It's pretty cool, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So the box was designed alongside Zoom, the company that Meredith Whitney works for us, so she was here telling us about it. This is one of Zoom's products. So it locks in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Meredith --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. It locks in. It's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like the lock. That is cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What are they calling it? The sausage or whatever?</p><p>CASONE: Incogmeato.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Incogmeato.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Incogmeato.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's delicious.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's really -- it's really delicious.</p><p>CASONE: If you're near the East Thomas Pizza Hut in Phoenix tomorrow. Go give it a try and e-mail or send us a Twitter message or send some pictures to the show and folks out there let us know what you think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know what I like better, the incogmeato or the round box. I am loving this warm pizza. How come nobody had that idea before -- round pizza boxes?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The key to all this -- I've said this before -- the key to all this plant-based the meats, the burgers, the fillings, sausages, does it have the toothiness of the usual, of the real stuff? Does it eat like a burger? Does it eat like crumbled sausage on a pizza? It's yes with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. You said it was delicious.</p><p>HOGAN: Very good. Absolutely delicious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool.</p><p>HOGAN: You guys are getting it right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you -- Cheryl. You're getting the pizza.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pizza for breakfast.</p><p>Coming up, Eli Lilly out with mixed earnings this morning. I'll be speaking with the CEO Dave Ricks when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly raising its 2019 profit forecast after reporting better than expected third quarter profits in the last hour. Revenue came in lower than expected however. Take a look at the stock this morning and how it is doing in the premarket right now on the hills of the third quarter earnings from Eli Lilly -- down 2 percent, plus.</p><p>Joining us right now in a \"First on Fox\" interview is Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks. Dave -- it's good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVE RICKS, CEO, ELI LILLY: Great to be back. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will really focused on where the growth is coming from at Lilly but first characterize the quarter for us.</p><p>RICKS: Yes, overall we had a strong quarter. We grew 3 percent on the top line really driven by 8 percent volume growth which is really our newest products. The company's launched 10 products in the last five years and those are now making up 44 percent of our revenue.</p><p>And that's good news because new medicines getting to patients, that's our business strategy that also drives financial success.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Of course. RICKS: We managed cost pretty well and we beat and raised on the bottom line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you've got the recently launched drugs certainly helping to offset some of the generic issues. Is that where the growth comes from in the next six months, in the next year?</p><p>RICKS: That's right. You know, that's an important point. As I said, really double digit volume growth driven by our newest products.</p><p>We have two headwinds that have showed up in this quarter. One is as you mentions loss of patents on key drugs like Cialis which lost its patent a year ago. We had a 6 percent headwind due to that.</p><p>I want to point out, that's an important part of the life cycle of our industry. And now that medicine is very inexpensive for patients who need it.</p><p>In addition we had, particularly in the U.S., price deflation -- this has been going on for a few years now. But our U.S. pricing was minus 5 percent, globally minus 4 percent. So those two things together were a drag on growth.</p><p>We still grew 3 percent. We do anticipate that drag reducing going forward because both in the case of Cialis which the comparable will get better going into Q4 as well as on the pricing where there is some one-time effects in Q3, we expect improvement on both those headwinds exiting this year into 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And real quick on the cancer drug, the pancreatic cancer drug, not meeting the primary end point in the overall survival. What can you tell us about that in terms of your cancer drugs and this pancreatic one that was a disappointment. Do you see that coming back in terms of the next year for another review?</p><p>RICKS: So yes -- thank you for the question. You're talking about a drug called pegilodecakin (ph) which we purchased a year and-a-half ago. It's being studied in three important studies.</p><p>The pancreatic cancer study was disappointing, not that surprising unfortunately, because pancreatic cancer has really proven to be one of the most difficult settings and difficult condition for patients.</p><p>But we're also studying it in two forms of lung cancer on top of other immuno-oncology therapies. Those readouts are coming toward the end of this this year, early next year. We're excited to see those readouts with this very novel mechanism that really seeks to partner with other immuno- oncology therapies to improve patients' lives.</p><p>We also, I would point out -- we had three other important readouts in the quarter in oncology. One in breast cancer with Verzenio which showed an overall survival benefit over nine months for the first time. That's an important benefit for patients.</p><p>And in two readouts on a drug we acquired earlier this year called selpercatinib (ph) Loxo 292, the acquisition of Loxo Oncology which showed enormous benefit really in lung cancer as well as in thyroid cancer. So a successful quarter for oncology overall. Of course, disappointing news on the pancreatic study.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I'm glad you said that because, you know, the fight against cancer continues every day. You guys have had some real innovative drugs in terms of oncology.</p><p>Would you -- is it fair to say that now with the acquisition you just mentioned, with the patents sort of hopefully in the rear view mirror, are you back toward a growth trajectory in terms of the pipeline and what's ahead for the coming five years? Or do you still have to deal with these patent expirations over the near term?</p><p>RICKS: Well, that's a key thing about our company is I think we have relatively few patent expiries both in this year but going forward, versus the rest of the industry. We do project strong growth going forward. In fact, between 2016 and 2020, we had projected average of 7 percent growth and we aim to hit that as we set guidance later this year, going into 2020.</p><p>And I think we have a bright future, really driven by the newest medicines and a relative lack of patent exposure in our portfolio. And of course, that's great news for patients, new medicines for serious conditions. We were talking about cancer just now but also diabetes, auto autoimmune conditions which are quite prevalent and pain which is an emerging area for us, non-opioid pain medicines really to help people with the most common condition that people have when they go to the doctor which is something hurts and we know all the problems with opioids. Lilly is inventing new ways to treat pain that don't have those negative properties.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Dave -- real quick. Is that an organic growth story or do you see an opportunity for further acquisitions in terms of filling some of those holes?</p><p>RICKS: It's both. Of course, we need a strong team of scientists. We have a great team of scientists here, discovering new medicines every day and attempting to get those to patients. But we complement that with partnerships and acquisitions, with biotech and other major pharma.</p><p>That's how our industry works. And we need to be active in all those areas but really focused on the diseases we know how to add value --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dave -- great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>RICKS: Thanks for having me. Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dave Ricks joining us there, CEO of Eli Lilly.</p><p>We are awaiting Boeing earnings amid questions of the 737 Max. Just yesterday the aerospace company announced that it is replacing the head of its commercial airplanes division.</p><p>Joining us right now is Blue Line Capital President, Bill Baruch and Stifel Airlines Analyst, Joseph DeNardi. Great to see you gentleman. Thanks very much for joining us as we await the Boeing earnings; they are coming out any second here.</p><p>Bill, your expectations in terms of what drove the quarter?</p><p>BILL BARUCH, PRESIDENT, BLUE LINE CAPITAL: I want to see how this thing responds on a price action basis. Now, they -- yesterday they talked about significant progress on the 737. Do they follow through? Do we see that come back on the quarter four? On top of that, do they announce any guidance? People overall just want to hear the guidance, even if it is bad. That could actually be a positive.</p><p>So lastly, the $5.6 million hit in July they announced, is it worse than that? Obviously if they announce the worse we could see the stock react more poorly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Joseph, it looks like the numbers are amiss on the earnings line. The 737 obviously has been the big issue. When you look at the earnings and the revenue over the near term, how big of an issue is the 737 going to be and for how much longer?</p><p>JOSEPH DENARDI, AIRLINES ANALYST, STIFEL: Yes, I think most U.S. airlines seem to assume that it's going to -- you know, be returned to service early next year. Obviously, that's several months later than they thought it was going to be returned a few months ago and so I think their view on when it comes back is just based on kind of their best guess at this point.</p><p>And so, yes, I think they're hoping it comes back as soon as Boeing's able to get it back in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the costs are obviously increasing for this company. That's also showing up in this quarter. Let's get to Jackie DeAngelis with the -- with the numbers on earnings and revenue which is a miss and the stock is trading down, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: It is a miss, Maria. And you can see the EPS, $1.45 adjusted. The expectation was $2.09. The revenue came in slightly higher at $19.98 billion, expectation there of $19.67 billion.</p><p>But as you mentioned, the 737 Max jet is really what's in focus this quarter. We actually have a quote from the CEO, saying our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max. And we're making steady progress there. That was the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg.</p><p>He also continues to say we've also taken action to further sharpen our company's focus on product and services safety. Maria, for now I'll send it back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you one thing, while you were talking, Jackie, we're seeing a real comeback in the stock. Right after the news were -- was released, you saw a decline of better than two percent, and it is off of the lows. Jackie DeAngelis, thank you. Omeed.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, so it's all well and good for the company to say that they think the 737 issue is behind them or it's getting to the finish line. I want to ask our guests about the regulatory issues, though, as well. Because it's really going to be ultimately up to the regulators. So how about the disconnect between the FAA here in the United States versus their equivalent in Europe and the disconnect that might occur between there as far as where these planes can actually fly. Do you guys have a thought on that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Bill?</p><p>BARUCH: Well, overall actually this could take weeks. I mean, it'd be -- it would be a big achievement to see this fly again in quarter four. You're probably looking at the quarter -- you know, and the first quarter of next year at best. And that's what the stock is responding to now.</p><p>What really matters, I look at this price action and there's a big support area, 320, and then a shelf below at $3.00. I always say, what are the best technical moves is a fundamental rejection. If we're rejecting lower prices on poor fundamentals right now and the market moves higher, that in it of itself is taking some of the sellers or most of the sellers are out of the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and then there's the impact on the airlines, Joe, right? I mean, the 737 Max affect has obviously impacted airlines like Southwest and JetBlue. Your reaction to that?</p><p>DENARDI: Well, in the -- in the airline industry, any constraint on capacity is good. And so, you know, in general what that's meant this year is have been better pricing trends and less capacity growth and so I think what airline investors are worried about next year is how much supply is going to come back online when the Max comes back in. To the extent that the -- that the return to service gets delayed, that's not necessarily a bad thing for airlines.</p><p>Our view is that Southwest may look at that as kind of an unacceptable risk for them if they're not able to grow and execute their strategy, they may have to look to diversify their fleet away from the Max in order to grow and not lose share.</p><p>And so I think what Southwest is probably most keyed in on at this point is Boeing's confidence that they'll be able to get production rates back to where they thought they would be and deliver to Southwest the 40 to 50 Maxes a year that they're going to need the next few years to grow and execute their strategy.</p><p>HOGAN: Joe, you bring up a really good point in terms of the diversity that Southwest has -- that has all of a sudden, you know, been sort of pointed out for not having and using all the Boeing product and none of the Airbus product where other airlines have some sort of combination of both.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I think what you really bring up is the fact that we have a duopoly here. And if that's the case and we think the 737 Max is going to get back up into production and up in the air at some point in 2020, how much of that eventuality do you think is priced in right now, what multiple is Boeing trading at and how much will the eventual success of the 737 getting back in the air at some point, let's call it the first half of next year is in there, and how risk -- how derisked does the stock look today?</p><p>DENARDI: Yes, I think -- I think ultimately it comes back to -- yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p><p>BARUCH: Go ahead -- go ahead. Sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill, you take it. Go ahead, Bill.</p><p>DENARDI: Ultimately it comes back to --</p><p>BARUCH: You know, I'm looking at 20 times multiple. I mean, you can see if someone is -- that's where they're seeing valuing down here and ultimately, again, 20 times multiple, so you can see something come back in online the first half of next year and buyers down here are going to see that progress later in the next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, go ahead, Joe. Sorry about that. Yes, I just do -- I know you follow the airlines, Joe. And wanted to make sure that you were on track with where you were following. But please weigh in.</p><p>DENARDI: No, I think ultimately it comes back to Boeing's ability to get rates back to where they thought they would be. That's ultimately I think what investors are most concerned about and I think as it relates to airlines, you know, that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on supply growth in the U.S.</p><p>Southwest represents, you know, call it 20 percent of domestic capacity, 10 percent of their own capacity, roughly should be on the Max right now. And so how quickly they're able to get those aircraft back into service has a pretty big impact on supply trends.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But what -- this is Dagen McDowell, Joe. Would Southwest bet on Airbus at a time when this administration is in a trade fight? I'm not talking about China, but that $7.5 billion award from the World Trade Organization over this long-running fight over the subsidies to Airbus. Would Southwest really bet on a com -- in that duopoly that competitor overseas that could be in the middle of a fight with the president?</p><p>DENARDI: That's a really good point. I think that's probably a consideration for Southwest.</p><p>I mean, look, at the end of the day, Southwest would prefer to not do anything. They would prefer to remain as a single fleet type and continue to do what they've been doing. It's resulted in them being the most successful airline in the industry. The point that we're trying to make is if they look a few years down the road -- they've expressed frustration that this year their supply is down year over year, while the rest of the industry is up four to five percent. That means that they are giving customers to other airlines. And they've accepted that to this point.</p><p>But if they lose confidence in Boeing's ability to give them the Maxes that they need to grow and do what they want to do, then they don't have many options other than either to try and convince Airbus to give them delivery slots which probably don't exist, or to do something inorganic and there aren't many airlines in the U.S. that the DOJ would allow Southwest to buy, I think. JetBlue would be one of them.</p><p>And so I think Southwest has to balance this, the risks that you brought up with the risk that maybe their capacity is constrained for a prolonged period of time when capacity at their competitors is not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is anybody surprised that this stock is sort of pushing to go positive right now? Caterpillar has given up -- I'm sorry, Boeing has given up much of the losses that we saw earlier and, Bill, they're sticking with this expectation that the 737 Max up, it just went positive, gets back in the air in the fourth quarter. Are you buying that? And look at the stock now, up on the session; it's up a quarter percent.</p><p>BARUCH: Well, they laid that groundwork yesterday. And really my thesis here was seeing that they wanted to get ahead of poor earnings and they did get ahead of what was overall seem poor earnings. But they're sticking with the fact that you're going to see this come back on the quarter and next this quarter.</p><p>So, if they follow through, yes, there's a -- there's a lot higher the stock can go, there's a lot of support down here. But remember, Friday was a very poor day for this stock. And what we're running into is that price action from Friday.</p><p>So it has a -- has a tall task to start recovering all of that. You don't really want to change this price action. You're going to see a lot of gyrations back and forth. And again, this is one number, but -- and if I understand correctly, there still is no true guidance out there. And if there's no true guidance out there, you're still going to see a lot of expectations waffle around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, they're talk -- they're talking about costs going up and they're talking about the 737 returning to the air in the fourth quarter but we don't see a guidance for the next year, that's true. Bill Baruch, Joseph DeNardi, good to see you both gentleman. Thank you so much.</p><p>DENARDI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll keep watching the story. And as you know, Caterpillar was a miss; that stock is down. But Boeing is now up. We'll see what that means for the markets. We're still expecting a 90 point selloff at the start of trading this morning for the Dow Industrials.</p><p>Coming up, we are bracing for the holidays, I'll be speaking with the CEO of UPS David Abney on how his company is prepping for the peak shipping season.</p><p>And then Lexus plugged in the automaker unveils its first ever electric vehicle. The photos and when you can power up, next up.</p><p>CASONE: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with some headlines for you.</p><p>Chipotle out with sizzling earnings after the bell. But it is not all good news. Shares initially climbed after its latest results came in better than expected but the stock is losing ground this morning, down almost a little more than 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Online sales soared 88 percent during the quarter but delivery costs also rose. That said; Chipotle is up more than 90 percent so far this year.</p><p>Meantime, Snap is trading higher in the premarket, stock up almost two percent; the parent of Snapchat reported a narrow than expected loss and revenue which beat the streets estimate. The number of active users increased by seven million. That did top expectations from analysts.</p><p>Well, Facebook is investing $1 billion to tackle the affordable housing crisis in California. Company says it's going to build 20,000 housing units over the next 10 years. Experts say the Bay Area economy has created one home for every 10 new jobs over the past decade. A lot of those are high paying jobs. That has caused home prices to skyrocket.</p><p>Facebook has been blamed for helping create this crisis, bringing tens of thousands of those higher paid workers into the Bay Area.</p><p>Lexus is plugging into the future. The automaker says it's going to unveil its first electric vehicle next month. And it's already showing off a concept car, the LF-30, there it is. It features a lot of futuristic tech like gesture control and artificial intelligence to adjust all the settings on the car and of course, yes, it drives itself.</p><p>All right, we've got a lot more coming up this morning. Holiday shipping almost here. Maria going to be speaking with UPS CEO David Abney coming up next on prepping for the peak season as customers hit that online store and all that shopping starts. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The holiday shopping season already heating up, meaning holiday shipping season is on deck as well. A lot of that shipping falling to UPS. The company maintains its relationship with Amazon after it dumped FedEx, helping growth.</p><p>Joining me right now is the CEO of UPS, David Abney. David, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVID ABNEY, CEO, UPS: Nice to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You just characterized your quarter as the best quarter in the company's history.</p><p>ABNEY: It absolutely was.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.</p><p>ABNEY: And it was balanced across all three sectors which is very important to us. I think the sector that's gotten the most attention is the U.S. domestic business, very, very strong. For this quarter compared to last year at the same time, we reduced our unit cost 2-1/2 percent which is something that I don't remember seeing before. And that resulted in the operating profit for the U.S. business grew 26 percent, so just an excellent quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did you -- how were you able to get a handle on costs so well, and decline those?</p><p>ABNEY: It really is the result of a lot of work that we've done. It's our strategies. It's our strategic imperatives that we've focused on. It is the investments that we have made in automating our buildings and optimizing our routes. So we're really getting the payback from those investments. And then at the end, its execution and our people just did an excellent job executing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are headed into now one of the most important times of the year, obviously. Are you expecting a surge in volumes around the holidays and what's your expectation for growth around that?</p><p>ABNEY: We do believe it's going to be a busy holiday season. Four less workdays between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year which just means that there's less days for a lot of the promotions that start right around Thanksgiving.</p><p>So we have built up, we have added this year five million additional square feet in buildings. That's 400,000 packages an hour that we can run over last year. And we've added 11 aircraft which is good, because with the change from second day to next day, we needed the additional lift. So we have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Going into the quarter, with the resignation of your COO, can you give us the impact there and what you're expecting?</p><p>ABNEY: Yes, I think what you have to keep in mind; Jim has been with us 35 years. So it was definitely a retirement and well-deserved, did an excellent job. He's going to work through us through peak. We have a solid bench of people too. So while we're going to miss Jim, obviously this organization keeps going and we have good people in the wing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So David, the last time we spoke we were sort of right smack in the middle of this trade fight, whether it's China, the uncertainty over USMCA. What has that done in terms of your market expectations and where we are with regard to this trade impacting overall growth, overall manufacturing?</p><p>ABNEY: There's been bright spots since we talked and then there's things that are still ongoing. So it's -- you know, I think it has more of an effect of customers looking to change their trade patterns. And so we have to look at how we move our assets around to adjust to those trade patterns.</p><p>A good example is our 747-8, our biggest aircraft. We were had them planned to go to China to the U.S. since the U.S. lane has reduced due to the trade war, we've actually moved one of those planes, China to Europe. And it's those kinds of things we do.</p><p>USMCA, we think is a bright spot. We think that Lighthizer's done a great job of getting bipartisan support, really believe that will be ratified.</p><p>China to U.S., there's -- the latest talks seem to be going in the right directions, so we're hopeful there.</p><p>And then with Brexit, we're just having to watch. It's kind of a day-to- day news breaker right now. But we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we're all waiting to see what happens there. Your sense of the B2B business right now which is so important for UPS, the small and mid-cap businesses, how would you characterize things?</p><p>ABNEY: That is our primary focus is to lean in and to make sure that we take care of the small and mid-size businesses. What they want is one thing, really. And that is to be able to compete from a logistics standpoint with the big e-tailors and retailers.</p><p>So we just introduced a digital access program and partnership with Shopify and with Stuffs.com and others. What that does is it gives access to their 1.5 million small businesses into our network.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>ABNEY: And so it's really it's a significant move and that is our focus is to help small and mid-size businesses compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I assume that would mean you're also affecting costs pretty efficiently as well with this -- with your new technology.</p><p>ABNEY: We are. And that technology allows us to connect to these programs. B2B is going to be multiple packages per stop and that's what really makes a difference.</p><p>And the fact that we're automating our buildings and optimizing our routes, all of that helps B2B. And it's one of the reasons that we had such a good quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us after -- about the drone business. UPS expanding its Flight Forward drone program after becoming the first company to gain FAA approval to transport medical supplies by drone. Really an interesting development.</p><p>ABNEY: Yes, we put a stake in the ground that we were going to be the first to get this certification from the FAA and we've worked real hard to do that.</p><p>Then we put a stake that we were going to be the first to scale it and because a lot of people may have wondered, could UPS take the market lead here, and we absolutely showed that we did. We announced partnerships with AmerisourceBergen with Kaiser Permanente and with CVS, so all three just really outstanding companies that we will be progressing our drone usage. And then we will go outside healthcare pretty quickly too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is amazing.</p><p>ABNEY: But the initial focus is healthcare.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you are approved to move supplies at WakeMed in Raleigh North Carolina and University Of Utah Health in Salt Lake City. Is that the goal to get more and more of those kinds of customers and partnerships to move these medical supplies?</p><p>ABNEY: Yes, that's the initial phase is to -- any of these campus type environments, we chose healthcare but it could be other campus type environments.</p><p>But the CVS, what makes it so interesting, it's the first retail partnership we have done and we're going to start testing quickly about actually taking shipments such as pharmaceuticals from a local CVS store and delivering it to homes. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's such a convenience.</p><p>ABNEY: It will be. And if it's something that you need very quickly, I mean, there's no faster delivery than drone deliveries. So we think it plays an important role.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so look ahead, David, to the next year or three. Where does the growth come from at UPS?</p><p>ABNEY: International still would be big growth area for us. Europe by the way, as we're continuing to gain market share, we're doing very well there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you seeing any growth in Europe?</p><p>ABNEY: Yes, we are. And we're kind of against the mode. And so that's going well for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, David, it's great to have you.</p><p>ABNEY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. David Abney, UPS. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019102302cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-CCB1-DXH2-61NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0001Q6L</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITIES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0009Q46</classCode><className>NATIONAL HOLDINGS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Looming over the tech industry is the possibility of government regulation intended to protect people's data and a deeper look into whether gigantic companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook need to be broken up.</p><p> Pichai's first appearance ever before Congress comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about election manipulation. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear. Lawmakers declined Google's offer to send lower-level executives.</p><p> Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part in last week's White House meeting with other tech executives on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p> Pichai reiterated Google's position that it has no plans \"right now\" to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government. If that changes, Pichai promised to be \"fully transparent\" about the move. Pichai has said that he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.</p><p> The CEO also insisted that Google's search engine is not biased against any political viewpoint.</p><p> President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging search results to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" The company has denied any such bias, and while the question has dogged tech companies for years, there's no evidence of an anti-conservative or any other political tilt.</p><p> Nadler called the notion of bias a \"delusion\" and a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" The New York Democrat said Tuesday's hearing was the committee's fourth to address the topic - and he suggested he'd move on to other topics as Democrats take control.</p><p> House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., kicked off the hearing by noting a \"widening gap of distrust\" between tech companies and the American people.</p><p> Asked for yes-or-no answers on what information the company collects, Pichai demurred and attempted to convey that things are more complicated, with varying degrees of success.</p><p> Momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies' collection of data.</p><p> Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to pin down Pichai concretely on privacy. \"I've got an iPhone,\" Poe said, waving his device. \"Can Google track me when I move?\" If he moved to the left toward his Democratic colleagues on the panel, would Google know?</p><p> \"Not by default,\" Pichai answered. Poe demanded a yes or no answer, but Pichai indicated it was complicated.</p><p> Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google - which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S. - has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p> Responding to a question about Google's search dominance, Pichai pointed to Amazon's dominance in online shopping.</p><p> Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company.</p><p> Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google's Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones, and its other services - including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser - are widely used.</p><p> ceo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-33253344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY6-7TR1-JC0C-J4YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The landscape we are currently enjoying is the handiwork of Janet Yellen's Federal Reserve and Barack Obama's White House.</p><p>Those who write to me don't agree. Their argument is that companies are bringing back investment, creating new jobs and there is new confidence because of the prospects of lower taxes, massive deregulation and stronger trade protections for American companies. In other words, President Trump has created this environment and he deserves the credit for its benefits.</p><p/><p>I can see the merit of this argument. Unfortunately, most private sector economists, like Professor Ken Rogoff at Harvard, a former chief economist at the IMF, don't agree with it. Time and again, these economists say, yes, Trump has had an effect, but it's too soon to give him full credit.</p><p>The debate will continue. I won't take sides.

The failure of the U.K.\u00c2\u00a0and EU to agree on a solution acceptable to all parties threatens to dash Theresa May's hopes of moving the EU negotiations in the new year.\u00c2\u00a0This uncertainty over the Irish issue and what it means for Brexit took its toll on the pound as many commentators said there is no easy solution. \u00c2\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Middle East is another geopolitical fault line. Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital has unleashed criticism and violence.</p><p/><p>Market volatility resurfaced as investors watched all of this. There was a rotation out of technology stocks and into older industrials at first. But by week's end, that rotation had rotated, with the Nasdaq bouncing back.\u00c2\u00a0Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised.\u00c2\u00a0The end of the year is nigh.\u00c2\u00a0Big tech stocks are sitting on sizable gains that can be locked in while banks, industrials and energy firms offer more value.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>I just wish that the outlook wasn't so unclear and that there weren't so many pitfalls ahead. Worries that many thought were cast aside could rise up and bite back once again.</p><p>Bitcoin's blistering run continues</p><p>Bitcoin is has topped $16,000, fueling fears of a bubble.</p><p>While it's true there is an element of tulip mania here -- even Venezuela wants to launch its own cryptocurrency -- it's worth noting that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Nasdaq are launching bitcoin futures. That may attract more interest from institutional investors.</p><p>But bitcoin is very risky. A leading digital currency marketplace was just hacked. Banks are warning regulators about fraud.</p><p>And there are concerns about the environmental impact of having massive data centers consuming tons of electricity to mine bitcoin.</p><p>-- Paul R. La Monica</p><p>Venezuela's woes worsen with new lawsuit</p><p>Venezuela has spent the past year sinking deeper into chaos. Now, China is turning up the heat to close out 2017.</p><p>One of the country's biggest state-owned firms has filed a lawsuit against Venezuela's oil company, PDVSA, in U.S. court.</p><p>Sinopec is accusing PDVSA of breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud, and is asking for $23.7 million plus interest and damages.</p><p>It's a headache -- but the amount is ultimately small compared to the estimated $196 billion Venezuela owes in all.</p><p>-- Julia Horowitz</p><p>Should Elon Musk merge Tesla with SpaceX?</p><p>Tesla's stock has cooled lately due to concerns about Model 3 production delays and integration risks with SolarCity. But Morgan Stanley has a suggestion for Elon Musk: Merge with privately held SpaceX, which Musk also runs.</p><p>The rocket market could be bigger than electric vehicles. There's also less competition. But does Musk run the risk of having too many balls in the air?</p><p>Tesla is also working on a Semi truck -- which beer king Anheuser-Busch just placed a big order for -- and Musk's The Boring Company is proposing a new underground tunnel system for Los Angeles. When does Musk sleep?</p><p>-- Paul R. La Monica</p><p>GE slashes jobs as American icon shrinks</p><p>GE's epic cash crunch has been driven by bad bets on fossil fuels.</p><p>GE's power division is bleeding because utilities are moving to renewables like solar. That's painful for GE, which\u00c2\u00a0makes equipment that helps power one-third of the world. Worse: GE recently shelled out $9.5 billion on Alstom's coal business.</p><p>Now, GE's power business is slashing 12,000 jobs to cut costs and stabilize the depressed stock price. Germany's Siemens similarly cut nearly 7,000 jobs, mostly in its power business. The problem for these companies is the migration away from fossil fuels may only speed up as renewables get cheaper.</p><p>-- Matt Egan</p><p>Quick takes</p><p>Coal CEO loves Trump but hates Senate tax overhaul. 'It wipes us out'\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>More alleged shady business at Wells Fargo: 1,500 fake insurance policies</p><p>Naming and shaming tax shelters: EU fires off warning to 17 tax shelters</p><p>Accounting nightmare: European owner of Mattress Firm crashes as CEO exits</p><p>Week of Brexit turmoil: UK doesn't know what it means, costs or how to do it</p><p>Saudi elite ensnared by corruption crackdown can escape -- if they pay cash</p><p>What's next</p><p>Time for the jobs report: The\u00c2\u00a0U.S. unemployment rate for November will be released Friday morning. Last month, unemployment dropped to 4.1%, the lowest rate in 17 years.</p><p>Anticipating a rate hike: A rate hike is expected when the Federal Reserve meets next Wednesday. Earlier this week, President Trump's pick to replace Janet Yellen moved a step closer to confirmation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20171207quest-ireland-brexit-israel-palestine1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R4N-V0H1-JBPX-W457-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>12:04 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 7, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0008EU0</classCode><className>CBOE HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009FYX</classCode><className>CME GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002KC3</classCode><className>CHINA PETROLEUM &amp;

The failure of the U.K.\u00a0and EU to agree on a solution acceptable to all parties threatens to dash Theresa May's hopes of moving the EU negotiations in the new year.\u00a0This uncertainty over the Irish issue and what it means for Brexit took its toll on the pound as many commentators said there is no easy solution. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Middle East is another geopolitical fault line. Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital has unleashed criticism and violence.</p><p>Market volatility resurfaced as investors watched all of this. There was a rotation out of technology stocks and into older industrials at first. But by week's end, that rotation had rotated, with the Nasdaq bouncing back.\u00a0Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised.\u00a0The end of the year is nigh.\u00a0Big tech stocks are sitting on sizable gains that can be locked in while banks, industrials and energy firms offer more value.\u00a0</p><p>I just wish that the outlook wasn't so unclear and that there weren't so many pitfalls ahead. Worries that many thought were cast aside could rise up and bite back once again.</p><p>Bitcoin is has topped $16,000, fueling fears of a bubble. </p><p>While it's true there is an element of tulip mania here -- even Venezuela wants to launch its own cryptocurrency -- it's worth noting that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Nasdaq are launching bitcoin futures. That may attract more interest from institutional investors. </p><p>But bitcoin is very risky. A leading digital currency marketplace was just hacked. Banks are warning regulators about fraud. </p><p>And there are concerns about the environmental impact of having massive data centers consuming tons of electricity to mine bitcoin.</p><p>-- Paul R. La Monica</p><p>Venezuela has spent the past year sinking deeper into chaos. Now, China is turning up the heat to close out 2017. </p><p>One of the country's biggest state-owned firms has filed a lawsuit against Venezuela's oil company, PDVSA, in U.S. court. </p><p>Sinopec is accusing PDVSA of breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud, and is asking for $23.7 million plus interest and damages. </p><p>It's a headache -- but the amount is ultimately small compared to the estimated $196 billion Venezuela owes in all.</p><p>-- Julia Horowitz</p><p>Tesla's stock has cooled lately due to concerns about Model 3 production delays and integration risks with SolarCity. But Morgan Stanley has a suggestion for Elon Musk: Merge with privately held SpaceX, which Musk also runs. </p><p>The rocket market could be bigger than electric vehicles. There's also less competition. But does Musk run the risk of having too many balls in the air? </p><p>Tesla is also working on a Semi truck -- which beer king Anheuser-Busch just placed a big order for -- and Musk's The Boring Company is proposing a new underground tunnel system for Los Angeles. When does Musk sleep?</p><p>-- Paul R. La Monica</p><p>GE's epic cash crunch has been driven by bad bets on fossil fuels. </p><p>GE's power division is bleeding because utilities are moving to renewables like solar. That's painful for GE, which\u00a0makes equipment that helps power one-third of the world. Worse: GE recently shelled out $9.5 billion on Alstom's coal business. </p><p>Now, GE's power business is slashing 12,000 jobs to cut costs and stabilize the depressed stock price. Germany's Siemens similarly cut nearly 7,000 jobs, mostly in its power business. The problem for these companies is the migration away from fossil fuels may only speed up as renewables get cheaper.</p><p>-- Matt Egan</p><p>Quick takes</p><p>Coal CEO loves Trump but hates Senate tax overhaul. 'It wipes us out'\u00a0</p><p>More alleged shady business at Wells Fargo: 1,500 fake insurance policies</p><p>Naming and shaming tax shelters: EU fires off warning to 17 tax shelters</p><p>Accounting nightmare: European owner of Mattress Firm crashes as CEO exits</p><p>Week of Brexit turmoil: UK doesn't know what it means, costs or how to do it</p><p>Saudi elite ensnared by corruption crackdown can escape -- if they pay cash</p><p>What's next</p><p>Time for the jobs report: The\u00a0U.S. unemployment rate for November will be released Friday morning. Last month, unemployment dropped to 4.1%, the lowest rate in 17 years.</p><p>Anticipating a rate hike: A rate hike is expected when the Federal Reserve meets next Wednesday. Earlier this week, President Trump's pick to replace Janet Yellen moved a step closer to confirmation.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Details are so far limited as to what will be investigated, but in the case of Google and Facebook, we believe the digital advertising market will be a key focus.

With Covid-19 having put healthcare among the top priorities for consumers and accelerating the digitalisation of healthcare, Amazon is taking advantage of the positive market momentum. Big Tech companies are increasingly competing against each other across several segments, with healthcare being one them. With this new service, Amazon has expanded its competition with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> into the wearable market. Amazon Halo, though, on top of classic functions (sleep tracking, activity tracking, heart rate monitoring) will offer two new services named 'Body' and 'Tone'; the former lets users measure their body fat through 3D body scans, while the latter tracks users' emotional wellbeing by listening to changes in their tone of voice throughout the day. </p><p><table><title>Where Big Tech Is Present</title><tgroup cols=\"8\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Streaming</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloud</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Healthcare</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finance</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Home</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advertising</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Autonomy</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Amazon</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Apple</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Facebook</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Google</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Microsoft</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p/></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Fitch Solutions    There is an ongoing shift from products to services in the tech sector, with companies looking to secure stable revenue streams by adopting subscription models. Amazon was one of the first to have shifted in this direction with Amazon Prime, and Amazon Halo will further strengthen the company's focus on securing recurring revenues. Amazon Halo will cost USD3.99 per month, with members having access to all the features offered by the service. Non-members will have access only to the basic functions (sleep tracking, activity tracking and heart rate monitoring).  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next:</emphasis> The new service will add weight to privacy concerns, as has been the case for Google's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fitbit</emphasis> acquisition. Amazon will be able to gather highly sensitive information and concerns will abound regarding data sharing with third parties and on how the company might exploit users' data to power and develop its other services (AWS, retail and advertising). The move will likely add momentum for calls for technology companies to be more comprehensively regulated as they increasingly become service providers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1577027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PH-V4N1-JD33-J20J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

There is a distinction to be made between free and paid speech, which is what speech paid through advertising is, and what role the tech platforms have in regulating such content. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But it also raises the question of the future model of the internet, and we believe we will start seeing a greater distinction between free and paid internet</emphasis>.The internet was built on advertising, which allowed tech companies to offer services for free. It is these companies - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter</emphasis> - which are now under pressure, not only because of the way they use personal data, with its subsequent privacy implications, but also because of the way they can be used for misinformation by both domestic and international actors. This model relies on collecting an enormous amount of data on individuals, because it is through targeted advertising that companies can make the most profit. Another model, contextual advertising, also exists, relying on search queries and posts made at the time, but is less margin-friendly. But many other companies, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spotify</emphasis>, have gone for a subscription or service model. This not only allows them to have recurring revenues from their customers, increasing loyalty, but also lowers some of their regulatory risks, as their platforms are less likely to be used for influence. This model does not mean that companies will not be using personal data to improve their products, or to lock in customers, but as the competitive structure of the market continues to evolve, with many tech companies now competing directly against each other, we expect it will continue to develop, especially in more mature markets where initial growth has plateaued. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: We do not expect that model to be fully introduced in emerging markets, because of the opportunities it would offer Chinese companies to dominate the consumer tech ecosystem; we have already seen that prices in those markets for monthly subscriptions are lower than in developed countries.

There is a distinction to be made between free and paid speech, which is what speech paid through advertising is, and what role the tech platforms have in regulating such content. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But it also raises the question of the future model of the internet, and we believe we will start seeing a greater distinction between free and paid internet</emphasis>.The internet was built on advertising, which allowed tech companies to offer services for free. It is these companies - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter</emphasis> - which are now under pressure, not only because of the way they use personal data, with its subsequent privacy implications, but also because of the way they can be used for misinformation by both domestic and international actors. This model relies on collecting an enormous amount of data on individuals, because it is through targeted advertising that companies can make the most profit. Another model, contextual advertising, also exists, relying on search queries and posts made at the time, but is less margin-friendly. But many other companies, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spotify</emphasis>, have gone for a subscription or service model. This not only allows them to have recurring revenues from their customers, increasing loyalty, but also lowers some of their regulatory risks, as their platforms are less likely to be used for influence. This model does not mean that companies will not be using personal data to improve their products, or to lock in customers, but as the competitive structure of the market continues to evolve, with many tech companies now competing directly against each other, we expect it will continue to develop, especially in more mature markets where initial growth has plateaued. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: We do not expect that model to be fully introduced in emerging markets, because of the opportunities it would offer Chinese companies to dominate the consumer tech ecosystem; we have already seen that prices in those markets for monthly subscriptions are lower than in developed countries. But we believe greater scrutiny on advertising will be one way different countries will look to regulate big tech companies, and this could even involve some markets looking to ban targeted advertising. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMTEIN-1558282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMTEIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609F-BYW1-F0J5-84Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

The latter already has an advantage through the greater penetration of its smart speakers, with Alexa being more widely available than Google Assistant within the home. Smart security is a sub-battle within the overall battle, and Google will hope that its partnership with ADT will increase the penetration of Nest devices, and enable it to compete better with Amazon's Ring. While Big Tech companies remain very different, they are increasingly competing against each other in a variety of segments. The home is one, to which can be added streaming, cloud, healthcare, finance, advertising and autonomy. Amazon and Google are the two companies whose ambition is to compete in all these segments.<table><title>Where Big Tech Is Present</title><tgroup cols=\"8\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Streaming</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloud</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Healthcare</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finance</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Home</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advertising</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Autonomy</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p/></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>x</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><p>x</p></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><p/></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Fitch Solutions    <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: We believe that Google only bought a stake in ADT as a full merger would have brought extra regulatory scrutiny; this is already the case for its deal for Fitbit.

In it, it accuses <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> of being a 'digital gangster', and of having intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implications</emphasis>: The report calls for the regulation of tech companies, which follows the European rather than the US approach, as the era of self-regulation is over. Coming from Parliament, it carries extra weight even if it is not binding for the government, and we highlight several key issues the report raises: Liability: it calls for the need for a new category beyond platforms or publishers for tech companies, so they can be liable if harmful content is found on their sites. These companies have de facto been given immunity though Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in the US, and greater scrutiny would have a major impact on their business models. Similar moves have been made in the US, with regards to deepfakes, but the report goes further; Code of Ethics and an independent regulator: very little details have been given on what would include a new Code of Ethics, and this is something that Parliament is likely to develop in the coming months. The call for a new regulator echoes a recent report on the impact of online media on journalism, and it is clear that, as tech companies impact many different aspects of public life, current sectoral regulators like the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) or CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) lack the necessary tools to scrutinise these players; Protection of inferred data: whereas the GDPR protects personal data, it excludes inferred data, which includes analysis of a particular profile as opposed to the collection of actual data. The fact that report calls for that extra protection suggests that, post-Brexit, the UK will continue to follow European data regulation and in some cases go even further than their European counterparts; Business model: it is clearly under scrutiny. The report accuses Facebook of violating both privacy and anti-competition laws, and this comes soon after the Bundeskartellamt's actions against the company, focusing on competition rather than data competition, also called for the social network to change its business model. Regulators are looking to put pressure on tech companies by focusing on both competition and data protection, and we can expect to see greater convergence of these two legal issues, with the aim to avoid the creation of new monopolies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: There will be further discussion in Parliament to decide which of these recommendations should go forward. The regulation of big tech is inevitable now, across many jurisdictions, and Facebook itself has recognised that by indicating it is open to meaningful regulation. Europe is ahead, but can only do so much against US companies. The likely fine that the FTC will impose on Facebook in the US could have far greater consequences if it is followed by new stricter rules. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: UK Digital Services Tax A Good Start, But More Needed', October 31 2018;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: US Deepfake Legislation A New Downside For Tech Giants', January 31 2019; and,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: Bundeskartellamt's Decision To Impact Facebook's Business Model', February 8 2019.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMTEIN-1437267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMTEIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHF-C491-JD33-J2HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

In it, it accuses <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> of being a 'digital gangster', and of having intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implications</emphasis>: The report calls for the regulation of tech companies, which follows the European rather than the US approach, as the era of self-regulation is over. Coming from Parliament, it carries extra weight even if it is not binding for the government, and we highlight several key issues the report raises: Liability: it calls for the need for a new category beyond platforms or publishers for tech companies, so they can be liable if harmful content is found on their sites. These companies have de facto been given immunity though Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in the US, and greater scrutiny would have a major impact on their business models. Similar moves have been made in the US, with regards to deepfakes, but the report goes further; Code of Ethics and an independent regulator: very little details have been given on what would include a new Code of Ethics, and this is something that Parliament is likely to develop in the coming months. The call for a new regulator echoes a recent report on the impact of online media on journalism, and it is clear that, as tech companies impact many different aspects of public life, current sectoral regulators like the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) or CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) lack the necessary tools to scrutinise these players; Protection of inferred data: whereas the GDPR protects personal data, it excludes inferred data, which includes analysis of a particular profile as opposed to the collection of actual data. The fact that report calls for that extra protection suggests that, post-Brexit, the UK will continue to follow European data regulation and in some cases go even further than their European counterparts; Business model: it is clearly under scrutiny. The report accuses Facebook of violating both privacy and anti-competition laws, and this comes soon after the Bundeskartellamt's actions against the company, focusing on competition rather than data competition, also called for the social network to change its business model. Regulators are looking to put pressure on tech companies by focusing on both competition and data protection, and we can expect to see greater convergence of these two legal issues, with the aim to avoid the creation of new monopolies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: There will be further discussion in Parliament to decide which of these recommendations should go forward. The regulation of big tech is inevitable now, across many jurisdictions, and Facebook itself has recognised that by indicating it is open to meaningful regulation. Europe is ahead, but can only do so much against US companies. The likely fine that the FTC will impose on Facebook in the US could have far greater consequences if it is followed by new stricter rules. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis>:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: UK Digital Services Tax A Good Start, But More Needed', October 31 2018;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: US Deepfake Legislation A New Downside For Tech Giants', January 31 2019; and,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: Bundeskartellamt's Decision To Impact Facebook's Business Model', February 8 2019.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1437267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG2-7J61-F0J5-83W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

However, security and privacy are the other two drivers for such rules, and the agreement prevents Canada and Mexico from implementing higher privacy standards, or ensuring some sensitive data (for instance health) have the right security. It gives Canadian and Mexican citizens fewer rights when it comes to knowing how their data is used, and could prevent these two countries from striking deals with jurisdictions with higher protection. Extension of section 230: US companies cannot be found liable for the content on their platforms, and cannot be sued in either Canada or Mexico. This is interesting because there is a level of bipartisan consensus about the need to remove section 230, and make the different internet platforms more responsible for the content they publish. The Christchurch Call to Action, which the US did not sign, had called for greater regulation, but the agreement suggests that the US will be looking to protect its own tech companies abroad, as President Trump did with the French Digital Services Tax, even as it looks for stricter regulation at home.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Next</emphasis>: The US, while looking to regulate big tech at home, has been pushing its tech advantage abroad, as the recent trade deal with Japan follows the same pattern as the USMCA.

The UK will be an interesting example to follow, as it will need to balance the interests of the US with demands from the EU, if it wants to retain adequacy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMTEIN-1510622</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMTEIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6056-0B51-F0J5-815P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Shh shh. The Dow's oh so still. Shh shh. It's been seven days. Shh shh. It's oh so peaceful until volatility explodes. </p><p>Zing! Boom! Bj\u00f6rk? Really, Mr. Great Stuff? What can I say? The brain wants what the brain wants. I heard this song on the way to work this morning \u2014 i.e., walking from my kitchen to my office after making coffee \u2014 and it stuck. Now, you too can share in today's earworm[1]. Wow. So, really Bj\u00f6rk. Huh. But it's not all just a pop culture reference. There's some market advice in there as well. Oh, Bj\u00f6rk, that great market sage For the past seven days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been quiet too quiet. After it rallied more than 6.5% in the first 11 days of August, the Dow has gone nowhere. Both the S&amp;#38;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit fresh all-time highs, but not the Dow. What gives? The biggest reason is that the Dow doesn't have quite the same Big Tech lineup of its Wall Street brethren. Tech is king in 2020, and the Dow's crown is decidedly light on FAANG gems. The Dow represents a cross-section of the U.S. economy. By design, that means its growth is driven by more than just tech stocks \u2014 just like the U.S. economy. So, what does the Dow's recent action tell us about the economy? Just look and see:That, dear reader, is the very picture of a lack of bullish conviction. The Dow wants to move higher, but investors just aren't willing to push prices any higher. However, neither are they willing to let prices fall from their lofty heights. The result is a tight, 200-point trading range for the Dow. But I thought this market was all about volatility! That's the funny thing \u2014 it is. Which means that we're about to see a period of 'Zing! Boom!' to quote Bj\u00f6rk. However, the ultimate 'Zing! Boom!' direction remains a coin flip at this point. We should see a correction given the stalling economic recovery. But then, we probably should've already seen that correction before the Dow broke out above 27,000 earlier this month. We all know Keynes' 'The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent.' quote, and it's rarely been more relevant. Yes, Keynes and Bj\u00f6rk: two great tastes that taste great together probably. My point is that it's been very, very quiet on the Dow lately, but don't let that lull you into complacency. We're hunting volatility. You Great Ones out there already know where this is going or at least you think you do. By now, many of you are familiar with Mike Carr's One Trade strategy. Quite a few of you have already used One Trade to flip a finger at 2020 and Wall Street's excessive volatility. But Mike's not one to rest on his laurels. This former rocket surgeon is about to launch a new research system that could really make your portfolio go 'Zing! Boom!' Mike will present this new strategy soon, but Great Stuff has your backstage passes ready to go now. We're hooking you up with a sneak peek at this next great trading system for free!

'Nipocalimab will be JNJ's first immune counter regulator and a catalyst to the next wave of innovation in treating autoantibody driven immune mediated disease,' said Cantor Fitzgerald Analyst Louise Chen[3]. Chen is clearly no Bj\u00f6rk, but he might just be on to something here. Nipowhatchamacallit has the potential to treat a broad swath of rare immune system diseases. And that means billions in potential revenue. Since nipopotamus is still in the experimental stages, it won't add to JNJ's bottom line anytime soon, but it's a positive long-term driver for the company's drug pipeline. For MNTA investors, today's your day. Either you were in or you weren't. If you value your portfolio, don't go chasing this stock after today.Better: Nailed It Who said retail is dead? Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT<url normalizedValue=\"https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=TGT&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false\">https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=TGT&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false</url>) \u2014 or 'Yuppie Walmart,' as I like to call it \u2014 absolutely crushed it with this morning's second-quarter financial report[4]: Earnings came in at $3.38 per share, versus $1.62 expected. Revenue soared to $23 billion, versus $20.09 billion expected. Same-store sales growth landed at 24.3%, versus 7.6% expected. What the 'usual suspects' don't show you is that online sales surged \u2014 Skyrocketed? Soared? Pick your own 'S-word' euphemism, you probably won't be wrong \u2014 700% from the same quarter last year! It's no wonder: According to CEO Brian Cornell, Target attracted 10 million new online customers in the first half of 2020. Thank you, pandemic? Still, Target didn't provide a current-quarter outlook, citing unpredictable U.S. back-to-school sales. Estimates are that 66% of U.S. students are distance learning at the start of this school year. 'Sitting here today, I don't know if 30 days from now that number is going to be 6% or 96%,' said Cornell. As for TGT investors, the stock rallied roughly 12% today. If you missed the mark on Target, you may want to wait for the shares to consolidate today's gains before aiming at this high-flying retailer.Best: More E-Commerce, More Power! (Various Grunts) From the windows to the walls, every fixer-upper project and honey-do list must be scratched off by now. Remember our chit-chat on home improvement yesterday[5]? If you thought Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD<url normalizedValue=\"https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=HD&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false\">https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=HD&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false</url>) had hard-hitting earnings, Lowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW<url normalizedValue=\"https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=LOW&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false\">https://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=LOW&amp;#38;checkSymbol=false</url>) just threw Home Depot off 'Hell in a Cell' to plummet 16 feet through an announcer's table. Earnings: $3.75 per share, versus $2.95 expected. Revenue: $27.3 billion, versus $24.27 billion expected. For reference, that's a 30% revenue jump[6] and an outstanding 68.7% surge in profit. Plus, every single U.S. region that Lowe's runs in saw same-store sales grow over 30% \u2014 a pipe dream for many retailers even outside of a pandemic. Remember, this increased profitability is at a time when Lowe's also shelled out '$460 million during the quarter on higher pay for hourly workers, store safety and supporting communities.' The real secret? You guessed it: e-commerce (again). Lowe's online sales more than doubled, soaring 135% this quarter as everyone hunted online for various thingamabobs and doohickies. But what does LOW get in return for the blowout quarter? A measly 2% jump that washed away in today's uncertain trading. Though, to be fair, LOW had a sizable run-up going into earnings, up over 140% from its pandemic LOWs, so profit-taking is expected. Whether you get low with the LOW rally now is up to you and you alone though, I will say this is exactly the type of well-run company with the right amount of online-shopping growth that we want to see in these pandemic earnings. Who knew Lowe's would beat Netflix Inc.

Biden Jr. has been critical of Big Tech, admonishing Facebook for mishandling misinformation and saying internet companies should lose a central legal protection. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But his campaign has quietly welcomed onto its staff and policy groups people who have worked with or for Silicon Valley giants, raising concerns among the industry's critics that the companies are seeking to co-opt a potential Biden administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  One of Mr. Biden's closest aides joined the campaign from Apple, while others held senior roles at firms that consulted for major tech companies. And a nearly 700-person volunteer group advising the campaign, the Innovation Policy Committee, includes at least eight people who work for Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Other committee members have close ties to the companies, including economists and lawyers who have advised them, and officials at think tanks funded by them.</p><p>  The group's members also include some prominent progressives arguing for stiffer regulation of tech. But the presence of the industry's allies inside Mr. Biden's policy apparatus and campaign and transition teams -- and his campaign's effort to ensure the confidentiality of its policy process -- has alarmed an increasingly influential coalition of liberals who say the tech titans stifle competition, disregard user privacy and fail to adequately police hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>  They are hoping to dissuade Mr. Biden, who has not made tech issues a major focus of his campaign, from following the example of his former boss, President Barack Obama, whose embrace of tech companies helped turn them into darlings in Washington.</p><p>  Today the tech giants are trying to fend off new regulations or antitrust lawsuits. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have spent more than a year investigating Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for possible violations of competition law. During a House hearing last month, lawmakers from both parties grilled the chief executives of all four companies about accusations that their dominance had hurt consumers, rivals and small businesses, as well as what they were doing to police false information.</p><p>  ''The environment is very different now,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of a think tank that has been funded in part by Google, the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation. ''When Obama took office, you know, tech was like a bromance kind of thing. Everybody loved it, and people didn't see the issues that some people see now.''</p><p>  A co-author of ''Big Is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business,'' a 2018 book, Mr. Atkinson is among the allies of Big Tech on the Innovation Policy Committee. While he said the members represented ''a fairly diverse set of views,'' he predicted that a potential Biden administration would face significant pressure from the left to clamp down on the major tech companies.</p><p>  Matt Hill, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, said in a statement that the former vice president would not take it easy on Big Tech.</p><p>  ''Many technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power but misled the American people, damaged our democracy and evaded any form of responsibility,'' Mr. Hill said. ''Anyone who thinks that campaign volunteers or advisers will change Joe Biden's fundamental commitment to stopping the abuse of power and stepping up for the middle class doesn't know Joe Biden.''</p><p>  The tech policy committee, which is broken down into smaller specialty groups, is part of a vast network of thousands of policy advisers assembled by the campaign. The policy teams do not have ultimate authority over the campaign's proposals or advise Mr. Biden directly. But lobbyists and activists are watching them closely for signs of Mr. Biden's approach to issues and his possible hiring pool if he is elected.</p><p>  Mr. Biden's campaign and transition team include advisers with ties to tech companies and other industries that worry liberals. Avril Haines, a former Obama national security and intelligence official who is helping to lead Mr. Biden's transition team, was a consultant for the data-mining company Palantir and WestExec Advisors, a firm that represented a major tech company it hasn't identified.</p><p>  A WestExec co-founder and Obama State Department official, Antony J. Blinken, is running the Biden campaign's foreign policy operation. WestExec has worked with the philanthropy started by Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, and with Google's in-house incubation unit, Jigsaw. But Mr. Blinken and Ms. Haines did not participate in that work, according to the Biden campaign, which said both advisers stepped away from WestExec this month.</p><p>  Cynthia C. Hogan, a former White House lawyer for Mr. Biden who is helping to lead his vice-presidential selection process, was a lobbyist and government affairs executive at Apple. She tendered her resignation  from the company in April, according to the Biden campaign.</p><p>  A spokeswoman for Google said in a statement that employees worked with campaigns in their personal capacities and not as representatives of the company. Apple said an employee participating in the Biden policy process was doing so on his own time during nights and weekends. Facebook declined to comment on the committee but pointed to a policy that allows employees to engage in political activities on their personal time. Amazon declined to comment.</p><p>  Among the participants in the large tech policy committee are Facebook's director of global competition policy, Anant Raut, and Matt Perault, who testified as director of public policy for the company during a congressional antitrust investigation last year before departing for academia.</p><p>  Another member is Howard Shelanski, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk who represents Facebook in the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust investigation into the company. He is not working with the group of committee members dealing with questions about the tech platforms, said a person familiar with his involvement, who would speak only anonymously.</p><p>  Still more members work for organizations, like Mr. Atkinson's, that receive funding from the companies or are economists who have consulted for Amazon, Google and Apple. Mr. Atkinson himself is not a member of the antitrust group.</p><p>  The committee is divided into smaller groups that focus on issues like antitrust policy, artificial intelligence, broadband access, disinformation and data privacy. The antitrust group includes people with tech ties like Mr. Perault, Mr. Raut and Mr. Shelanski. But it also includes some people who have pushed for more scrutiny of the tech giants, including employees at rival companies as well as the activist Sarah Miller and Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, prominent critics who have called for more vigorous antitrust enforcement. (Mr. Wu is also a contributing opinion writer at The Times.)</p><p>  The Biden campaign identified two aides, Bruce Reed and Stef Feldman, as more directly counseling the former vice president on technology issues. The campaign said Mr. Blinken was not advising the campaign on domestic technology policy. It stressed that members of its policy committees were not there to represent their employers or clients, and that lobbyists -- except those who represent labor unions -- were barred from participating.</p><p>  After The Times asked members of the tech policy volunteer group about their work, some of them received a message ''to remind everyone that the work we are doing here is for the purpose of developing policy positions that are sound and in the best interest of the candidate and his election as president.''</p><p>  The message noted that there were ''a variety of rumors floating around'' about how ''the campaign is managing conflicts of interest and lobbying by corporate and other interests.'' And it acknowledged that while ''it is sometimes hard to separate one's personal views from those of one's employer or clients,'' members should do their ''absolute best to ensure that the ideas that you offer up and the contributions that you make are consistent with what is best for the candidate and not what is best for you or your clients or your employer.''</p><p>  A list of rules provided to members of the policy groups, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, instructs participants not to disclose their participation ''on social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn or in your professional bio.'' It also warns them not to discuss or distribute names of other committee members, contents of committee conversations, emails from the committee or to talk to the news media.</p><p>  ''Simply put, do not talk to the press,'' the document reads, emphasizing ''do not talk to the press'' in boldface.</p><p>  Several members of the tech committee followed that guidance, declining to discuss their involvement and referring inquiries to the campaign. But some members of the antitrust subgroup expressed optimism that a Biden administration would usher in more rigorous approaches to the law.</p><p>  ''We're really at the crux of needing some very, very strong leadership on antitrust and competition, and some strengthening of the laws,'' said Diana L. Moss, a member of the antitrust subgroup and president of the American Antitrust Institute, whose think tank has accepted funds from Amazon and Google.</p><p>  ''We've had 40 years of lax enforcement and all the damage to prove it,'' she said, stressing that she was speaking for herself and not the Biden policy committee.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Top, former Vice President Joseph R.
