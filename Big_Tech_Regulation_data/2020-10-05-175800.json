Elizabeth Warren[2] (D-Mass.) went on the offensive early, detailing a plan[3]in early March to break up Facebook, Amazon and Google. </p><p>Other candidates, like Sen.Cory Booker[4] (D-N.J.),aren't so sure[5]. Incidentally, Silicon Valley has given Booker piles of cash[6] over the years.Here's where many of the candidates stand: Elizabeth Warren Warren prompted much of this debate with her March 8 article[7]explaining, in no uncertain terms, how and why it's time to break up tech monopolies. She defines tech monopolies as companies with annual global revenue of $25 billion or more 'that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties.'Warren believes WhatsApp and Instagram should be split off from Facebook and that the resulting competition between the three would force them to take user privacy more seriously.'We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold\u200a,' she wrote[8], '\u200aand do it in a way that doesn't lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data.' Cory Booker After Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called for the social media company to be broken up, Sen. Cory Booker tells ABC News' @jonkarl[9] that antitrust laws need to be enforced: 'We've had a problem in America with corporate consolidation' <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/PkZ2sPYax7\">https://t.co/PkZ2sPYax7</url>[10]pic.twitter.com/hDDqYwqQHd[11] \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) May 12, 2019[12] 'I don't think that a president should be running around, pointing at companies and saying 'break them up' without any kind of process here,' Booker told ABC[13] last weekend. 'Do I think it is a massive problem in America, corporate consolidation? Absolutely. It's about making sure that we have a system that works.';He continued: 'It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say: 'I'm going to break up you guys, I'm gonna break' \u2014 no.' Kamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris says \"Facebook has experienced massive growth and has prioritized its growth over the best interests of its consumers It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\" #CNNSOTU[14]pic.twitter.com/LADYpEaT7h[15] \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 12, 2019[16] Facebook may reside in her home state, but that's apparently not an issue for Sen. Kamala Harris[17] (D-Calif.), who has compared Facebook to a utility[18] that might need breaking up.'I think we have to seriously take a look at [breaking up Facebook], yes,' Harris told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'So we have to recognize it for what it is. It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.' Joe Biden In an interview Monday with The Associated Press[19], the former vice president said breaking up large tech companies is 'something we should take a really hard look at.'Biden spoke approvingly of Warren for making 'a very strong case' in favor of regulation but stopped short of making any firm commitment to that effect. Beto O'Rourke The Texas Democrat favors regulating Facebook over splitting it into a handful of separate companies, he told CNN's Eric Bradner[20]:I asked @BetoORourke[21] about breaking up big tech, which @ewarren[22] has proposed. He said the U.S. should 'regulate them more seriously, and perhaps to treat them a little bit more like a utility.' Here's his full response (including an aside joking about lengthy user agreements): pic.twitter.com/kHWc9fu3H1[23] \u2014 Eric Bradner (@ericbradner) March 20, 2019[24]Pete Buttigieg South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg[25] has said he's 'potentially' in agreement with Warren's plan, but he's more concerned about Facebook's conduct than size:;'Again, to me, it's about fairness and competition,' he told CNN[26] in March. 'So if they're using dominance of one market to dominate another one, then that's a problem. But the size itself isn't the biggest problem, in my view.''It's not how big they are; it's how they act. And that's the thing I think we need to be regulating and targeting most.'Buttigieg also expressed sympathy[27]for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whom he cast as in a difficult position because Facebook's 'corporate policy decisions are now public policy decisions.' John Hickenlooper FormerColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper wants the Federal Trade Commission to look into the industry and encourage more enforcement of antitrust laws.He's stopped short of explicitly calling for the breakup of Facebook and other companies, though his campaign told Reuters[28]that proper enforcement of antitrust laws, with an emphasis on competition, could have that result. Bernie Sanders While VermontSen. Bernie Sanders[29]more often goes after Amazon[30] for its tax avoidance and low pay for workers, he's expressed support for breaking up 'unchecked corporate power' across the board, including Facebook:I applaud Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes for sounding the alarm on the dangers of unchecked corporate power. We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives\u2014including our government. It's time to take that power back.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/L3eEofZtnh\">https://t.co/L3eEofZtnh</url>[31] \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 10, 2019[32]Amy Klobuchar Sen. Amy Klobuchar[33] (D-Minn.) also stopped short of calling for a breakup for breakup's sake and instead said we should 'supercharge[34]' antitrust enforcement.'My goal is to make antitrust cool again and make people realize that we are in\u2014 not just heading into \u2014 another Gilded Age of consolidation,' Klobuchar said[35] in an address at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, in March.'When you look at [rising] prices, lack of choices in certain areas, lack of innovation, no competition ... you just have companies relying on their own products. Why would they develop new products if they have a monopoly on the market?''Antitrust has to become part of the political discussion. What's really important over decades is what's happening to consumers. We can't just sit back and do nothing.' Tulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard[36] (D-Hawaii) is on the same page as Warren, likening tech monopolies to power-hungry groups incapable of self-regulating:Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/OrdOqH0ZFB\">https://t.co/OrdOqH0ZFB</url>[37] \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) March 12, 2019[38]Andrew Yang The businessman and political newcomer has made technological automation a central part of his campaign, arguing in favor of a universal basic income to offset the millions of jobs expected to be made obsolete by new technology.Yang has called for the creation of a new federal watchdog[39] to keep an eye on U.S. tech companies like Facebook and Twitter.

Notably, almost all of the company's first 20 employees have since left the company. Only two remain, and you can probably guess who one of them is. Some have become venture capitalists: Kevin Colleran opened Slow Ventures, while Sean Parker worked at Founders Fund for eight years. </p><p>Others have founded their own companies: Dustin Moskovitz launched Asana, while Steve Chen created YouTube. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Who were the people behind Facebook when it was just a startup? And where are they now? Only two of Facebook's first 20 employees still work at the company \u2014 and you can probably guess one of them. Most left during the social network's early days to work at other tech companies or start their own. Several have become successful investors at large VC firms; many are now absurdly rich following Facebook's IPO in 2012. Here's where Facebook's first 20 employees are now. Alex Heath contributed to an earlier version of this article. Dustin Moskovitz, Facebook's first CTO, was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate. The two dropped out of Harvard together to move to California and work on Facebook. Horacio Villalobos - Corbis/Getty ImagesEmployed by Facebook: February 2004 to November 2009 Position: Cofounder Where he is now: Moskovitz is the cofounder and CEO at enterprise software company Asana. He also cofounded Good Ventures[2], a philanthropic firm with a mission \"to help humanity thrive.\" He has a net worth of nearly $11.6 billion, according to Forbes[3].Chris Hughes cofounded Facebook and served as the site's first spokesman. He later coordinated all social networking aspects of Obama's 2008 campaign. Ramin Talaie/Corbis via Getty ImagesEmployed by Facebook: February 2004 to 2007 Position at Facebook: Cofounder Where he is now: After working on Obama's 2008 campaign, Hughes became executive director of Jumo, a startup that tried to utilize social media to change the world. In 2012, he purchased a majority stake in The New Republic and became its executive chairman and editor-in-chief. He put the magazine up for sale[4] in 2016 after it failed to become profitable. Hughes made $500 million when Facebook went public. He recently wrote a book called \"The Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn,\" citing his own wealth, most of which stemmed from his 2% ownership in Facebook. And in May 2019, Hughes dropped a bombshell by publishing an op-ed in The New York Times[5] that called regulators to break up Facebook in order to protect users and competition. Hughes is now co-chair of the Economic Security Project[6], a group that wants to make universal basic income a reality in the US.Eduardo Saverin was a Facebook cofounder and its first CFO. He famously sued Mark Zuckerberg and the two reached a settlement. Edgar Su/ReutersEmployed by Facebook: February 2004 to 2005 Position: Cofounder Where he is now: After winning a legal battle with Facebook that let him retain his cofounder status, Saverin began angel investing in startups like Qwiki and Chris Hughes' Jumo. In 2011, Saverin renounced his US citizenship[7] and moved to Singapore, meaning the taxes he had to pay on capital gains when Facebook went public were significantly reduced. He says he has no hard feelings[8] when it comes to Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg, who ousted him from the company shortly after its launch. Saverin has a net worth of roughly $10.5 billion, according to Forbes[9].See the rest of the story at Business Insider[10] See Also: Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates' philanthropic organizations helped

The EU's anti-competition watchdogs have slapped the company with a huge penalty for what it sees as sketchy web practices that emphasize Google's own services over those of competitors, creating an anti-competitive environment and driving other companies away. A group of seven big tech companies in the US have voices their support of the action, and it's a very interesting mix, including the likes of Yelp, News Corp, Getty Images, and even Oracle. So what's their beef?</p><p> Well, it's complicated.Google(or, to be more accurate, Alphabet) is so huge at this point \u2014 and has its hands in so many different industries \u2014 that it is fighting a war on a seemingly infinite number of fronts. That inevitably wins the company many enemies, and while their voice is unified in the letter sent to the European Commission, each of them have their own motives for supporting regulatory action against Googleand its parent company. Here's the letter the companies signed and sent to the EC:Dear Commissioner Vestager, We represent US companies that employ hundreds of thousands of workers across 50 states. We are writing to express our support for the Commission's enforcement action against Google. As you near final decisions in the Shopping and Android cases, Googleand its allies will no doubt continue to press through its lobbying and public relations machine the fiction that any adverse decision amounts to European 'protectionism.' As U.S. based companies, we wish to go on record that enforcement action against Googleis necessary and appropriate, not provincial. We have watched Googleundermine competition in the United States and abroad. Googleoperates on a global scale and across the entire online ecosystem, destroying jobs and stifling innovation. Googleand its allies may also claim that there is no factual basis for a decision against Google. That too is untrue. The case against Google, both in Europe and the United States, rests on sound legal and factual foundations. Indeed, the US Federal Trade Commission legal staff found that Googlehas monopoly power and that it engages in anticompetitive practices. We believe that decisive action is necessary to restore competition and once again open the Internet to innovation and growth. We hope that your counterparts in the United States will use this as an opportunity to address similar anticompetitive conduct by Google. Sincerely, Disconnect, Inc.

Disconnect Search[1] uses DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Yahoo search, but adds a layer of privacy to the user interactions, preventing tracking and other things it sees as privacy violations. It is, by most accounts, a fine app and a lovely service, but the conflict here is pretty obvious. Getty Images- Getty Imageshas had a long and volatile relationship[2] with Google, and more specifically with Google's photo search feature. The company has repeated claimed that Googlepromoted photo piracy by scraping images from anywhere and everywhere, and then displaying and facilitating downloads of those images even if they are copyright protected. Getty has stated that it has seen a huge decline in its traffic (and thereby its business) in recent years, and it sees Google's image service as the main reason for that. News Corporation- News Corp(and more specifically top dog Rupert Murdoch) have long despised Google's ever-expanding business and accused it of manipulating search results in a way that ignores 'quality,' while also speaking out[3] against Google's increasingly dominant ad business, which it believes holds far too much control over publishers and the entire online ecosystem. News Media Alliance - This one all comes down to advertising. The News Media Alliance is absolutely incensed that Googlehas adopted the guidelines set forth by the Coalition for Better Ads, and applied those rules across the board via a built-in ad-blocker for Chrome. Chrome is the most popular browser today, which means the majority of people won't see ads that Googledeems to cross the line, and the NMA fears[4] that action will affect how publishers position their content and make their money online. Oracle - Googleand Oracle have battled over Java for the better part of a decade. It's been a long and dirty battle, and it's far too complex to break down in a single paragraph, but this feature article from The Register[5] will get you up to speed. Suffice it to say that Google's size, power, and IDGAF attitude lies at the center of this particular beef. Trip.com - You go to Trip.com (formerly Gogobot) to plan trips. That's how it's been since 2010. In late 2016, Googledecided that you should go to GoogleTrips to plan your travels instead. You can imagine how this was received by Trip.com. This is probably the most straightforward beef of them all. Yelp - Yelp strongly believes[6] that GoogleSearch and its ad business is a monopoly in the truest sense of the word. The company and its CEO insist that Googlefavors its own services and businesses over all else, even if Google's version of said products and services are 'inferior' to those of the competition. The company also helped launch the 'Focus On The User[7]' initiative to emphasize Google's failure to play by ethical rules.

Some writers still\u00a0even refer to their pet region as 'Silicon &lt;insert naturally-occurring geographic phenomenon here&gt;' \u2014 though thankfully this practice has fallen out of\u00a0favor. (No matter\u00a0how excited you are about software enterprises in Panama, there is no such thing as a 'Silicon Isthmus.') But when it comes to India,\u00a0Asia's third largest economy, the excitement from investors and entrepreneurs is real \u2014 and for good reason. </p><p>Last year, startup funding in India\u00a0increased threefold to $5 billion annually[1].\u00a0And\u00a0according to the National Association of Software and Services Company[2], India is already the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world after the US and the UK \u2014 not to mention, the fastest-growing.\u00a0The number of startups in India is expected to rise from 3,100 to 11,500 by the end of 2020. This week brought even more evidence of India's ascendance to the global entrepreneurial\u00a0elite, as\u00a0the prominent US-based venture firm Accel Partners*\u00a0closed a $305 million fund devoted to early-stage startups\u00a0in the region. This is the fourth major investment Accel\u00a0has made in India since 2005, and their portfolio already includes some of the country's biggest and most important technology companies, including ecommerce giant Flipkart, which has raised a total of $2.5 billion in private funding and is now valued at over $10 billion[3], FreshDesk, an enterprise software company that has raised\u00a0$45 million, and\u00a0TaxiForSure, which was acquired by Uber's biggest competitor in India, Ola. Getting in early has paid off: Accel invested in the 'deca-unicorn'\u00a0Flipkart 'when it was just run out of an apartment in Bangalore,' according to Accel Director Steve Mnich. The factors driving India's robust startup industry\u00a0have been mounting\u00a0for years. They include\u00a0rapid growth in\u00a0GDP (which has doubled since 2003), an explosion in\u00a0smartphone adoption, and a young population consisting of\u00a0over half a billion citizens under the age of 25. (That's even larger\u00a0than the number of people in China who are under 25). Indian startups are also working within\u00a0a regulatory framework\u00a0that's friendlier to businesses than any in years, thanks in part to Prime Minister <person><nameText>Narendra Modi </nameText></person>\u2014 or as Pando's Mark Ames calls him, 'big tech's favorite ultranationalist.' (Ames and Yasha Levine have reported extensively[4] on the darker side of Modi who, as implicated by Human Rights Watch and others, played a gruesome role in the mass killing and displacement of minority Muslims). But while these industry pressures\u00a0are over a decade in the making, and while observers have been talking up the economic potential of India for just as long, Accel partner Sameer Gandhi tells me the\u00a0country has\u00a0only recently\u00a0hit a tipping point within the last 18 months or so. 'Coming up on a decade now, we're probably at that point now where most people would look at it and say, 'It's still early days,'' Gandhi says. 'But all of those factors we've been anticipating have been coming together.\u00a0I would say it's the first time we've been able to tell that story with real data points and convictions.' Investors like to talk up\u00a0the positives of any investment, often disingenuously so, to the point where\u00a0they paint entire ecosystems\u00a0and industries\u00a0as picture-perfect techno-utopias. But the challenges in India are very real, and Gandhi\u00a0has no illusions about them. 'It's a challenging place to do business,' Gandhi\u00a0said. 'It's got difficult infrastructure to contend with:\u00a0Logistics, payments, basic things like power and water, are not trivial problems.' And clean water isn't the only struggle related to liquidity. 'It's been a challenge to do exits in India,' Mnich\u00a0says, as the frequency\u00a0of liquidity events is more limited in India.\u00a0That said,\u00a0he later adds, 'They're making it much easier to have Indian companies list in the US. If you're a large company growing in India,\u00a0you want to be listed\u00a0on Nasdaq.' There\u00a0are also\u00a0psychological and social obstacles\u00a0to India's rise as an startup\u00a0hotbed, similar to the ones\u00a0commentators like Richard Bottoms and digitalundivided's Kathryn Finney\u00a0say[5]\u00a0exist[6]\u00a0in the US within minority communities looking to undertake the entrepreneurial lifestyle. 'Obviously there\u00a0are\u00a0big cultural differences [between Silicon Valley and India] too,' Gandhi said. 'The notion of, is working in the high growth private company startup viewed as being an acceptable career path? Is entrepreneurship a path?' Because of these and other challenges, investing heavily in non-Western markets can be a risky prospect. But for Accel, the differences between the markets in the US and India can also provide some valuable lessons to take home when helping companies grow stateside. 'In India we see what an Internet population that's driven by mobile connectivity looks like,' Gandhi said. 'It's like a view into the future in some sense, thinking mobile first. The US grew up in the web and PC world and are now making the transition to mobile. [But] many people will only access the Internet or ecommerce via their phone. That's an interesting way to approach the market.' Furthermore, because the region's\u00a0technology industry is still very much in a growth stage, Indian startups that sell to other enterprises will likely find that most of their potential customers are based outside their home country. That's a huge challenge, but a rewarding one to tackle. Freshdesk, for example, has had 'to sell globally day one, but in a way that would not require very intensive sales and marketing and technical support,' Gandhi said. In helping these companies grow, he added, 'You think of different ways to build products that are accessible to business and consumers.' And\u00a0then there's the flipside of this notion: Building companies whose customers could only exist in India or a similar region because of unique political and economic circumstances. Gandhi cites Portea[7], a Bangalore-based direct-to-consumer healthcare startup that has raised $8 million to date. 'When you think about the availability of health care [in India] it's not there for a good chunk of the population,' says Gandhi. 'In the US we talk about restructuring the system. There, we're talking about building it.' That wide-open market has allowed Portea to expand to almost two dozen cities without having to contend with insurance companies and other complexities that plague America's healthcare system. The regulatory, cultural, and economic\u00a0challenges of building\u00a0a startup in India are still formidable. But over\u00a0the last 18 months, Gandhi and Mnich say, the\u00a0ecosystem has\u00a0finally begun to fulfill\u00a0the potential that optimistic pro-business\u00a0advocates have been voicing for the past 15 years. 'For the first time in literally a generation, you have a majority government in India that I think understands the importance of the innovation economy and is starting to shed and move aside the roadblocks and regulations that really hamper a lot of investment in India,' Mnich said.\u00a0'Back when we first started investing in India, it could take 10 to 12 years to take any company to any kind of interesting scale.' Gandhi agreed, adding,\u00a0'Now not only do we see\u00a0companies of significant scale, but they can be done in 'Silicon Valley scale' in terms of the rapid stunning growth. That's the excitement of why we're in India and doing these things.' *Accel Partners is an investor in Pando[8] [photo by Rajarshi Mitra][9] David Holmes David Holmes is Pando's East Coast Editor.

Along with \"Reputation,\" Swift released some videos and behind-the-scenes clips that were tied to it. But if you wanted to watch them, you had to be a subscriber to AT&amp;T or DirecTV, the company's pay TV service. Thanks to an exclusive deal AT&amp;T had signed, everyone else was out of luck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The situation may not seem like a big deal - especially if you're not a Swiftie. And to be clear, the exclusive arrangement between AT&amp;T and Swift isn't related to the potential mega-merger.</p><p>But the arrangement offers a sense of how AT&amp;T thinks about creative content. The company sees videos, TV shows, and movies as tools it can use to capture and keep customers - and squeeze as much money as possible out of them.</p><p>That's worrisome, because if the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal gets approved by regulators, it won't just be Tay Tay's videos that the combined company will control. It will also rule over a vast collection of video and other popular entertainment, ranging from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" to the rights to NBA games on TNT. And it's almost certain to use its control over that content to its benefit.</p><p>AT&amp;T's is trying to buy Time Warner so it can make more money off its current customers and attract new ones from rivals, said Matt Wood, the policy director at Free Press, a consumer advocacy group.</p><p>\"When AT&amp;T buys a lot of content, they use that content as a sword,\" Wood said.</p><p>AT&amp;T did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>As part of its strategy, the newly enlarged AT&amp;T may in some cases limit some of its new videos and movies and other Time Warner content to its own subscribers. For example, it could potentially create new \"Harry Potter\" videos or shows involving characters from the DC comics universe and only allow its customers to watch them. If you were a customer of Verizon or some other service, you would be out of luck.</p><p>But more frequently, it may try to ensure that its subscribers get the best experience with its movies, shows, and services. At the same time, it may also try to make sure that when consumers try to access its content through other companies' services, the experience is less than ideal.</p><p>We've already seen a hint at that this year when AT&amp;T started offering HBO's streaming service for free with some of its unlimited wireless plans. You can still watch HBO if you have Verizon or T-Mobile, of course, but you won't be getting it for free.</p><p>If AT&amp;T continues the promotion after it owns HBO, it will give the telecom giant an unfair advantage over its rivals. To do the same thing for their customers, they'd have to pay AT&amp;T - assuming AT&amp;T would even allow them to do that.</p><p>And AT&amp;T could do other things to give itself a leg up. It could make the experience of watching its rivals shows or accessing their services a worse experience than watching or accessing its own. Potentially, AT&amp;T could make it harder for its customers to tune in Fox than CNN or the Disney Channel than TBS.</p><p>Similar concerns were voiced at the beginning of this decade when Comcast was trying to buy NBC Universal. Just like we're seeing today, a cable and internet provider was attempting to snap up a company that controlled massive amounts of content. Michael Copps, then a commissioner with the Federal Communications Commission, which had oversight over the merger, worried at the time that the tie-up would put too much power into the hands of one giant corporation.</p><p>In particular, Copps was worried about the effect the deal would have on Time Warner's newsrooms and news gathering.</p><p>\"I had seen merger after merger come along where the costs were in the billions of dollars,\" said Copps, who ended up being the only one of the FCC's five commissioners who voted against the deal. \"A lot of these big companies turn to newsrooms as a way to cut costs.\"</p><p>He continued: \"It's dumbed down our democratic dialogue.\"</p><p>By merging with Time-Warner, AT&amp;T would be in a similar position to dominate the way we get information and entertainment, with similar potential consequences. Indeed, it may be in a better position than Comcast was.\u00a0</p><p>AT&amp;T is developing an advanced mobile broadband service known as 5G that could one day replace the wired internet service you use today, which may well come from Comcast. And unlike Comcast, which only offers its traditional cable TV service in areas where it has coaxial cable lines, AT&amp;T offers its competing DirecTV Now service to basically everyone in the US who has a broadband connection.</p><p>Allowing AT&amp;T to gobble up Time Warner would put a company that already has a good deal of control over how we access media - and likely will soon have more - in charge of much of the media we access.

AT... past moves have shown that it will likely use its control over Time Warner's shows and movies to thwart rivals and charge customers more.The company could limit access to Time Warner's content to its own subscribers or make that content cheaper or easier for its subscribers to watch. If you want to understand how AT... proposed $85 billion\u00a0purchase of Time Warner might affect you, you only have to be a Taylor Swift fan. Swift, as you likely know, just released a new album this month. </p><p>Along with \"Reputation,\" Swift released some videos and behind-the-scenes clips that were tied to it. But if you wanted to watch them, you had to be a subscriber to AT...r DirecTV, the company's pay TV service. Thanks to an exclusive deal AT...ad signed, everyone else was out of luck. The situation may not seem like a big deal \u2014 especially if you're not a Swiftie. And to be clear, the exclusive arrangement between AT...nd Swift isn't related to the potential mega-merger. But the arrangement offers a sense of how AT...hinks about creative content. The company sees videos, TV shows, and movies as tools it can use to capture and keep customers \u2014 and squeeze as much money as possible out of them. That's worrisome, because if the AT...ime Warner deal gets approved by regulators, it won't just be Tay Tay's videos that the combined company will control. It will also rule over a vast collection of video and other popular entertainment, ranging from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" to the rights to NBA games on TNT. And it's almost certain to use its control over that content to its benefit. AT... is trying to buy Time Warner so it can make more money off its current customers and attract new ones from rivals, said Matt Wood, the policy director at Free Press, a consumer advocacy group. \"When AT...uys a lot of content, they use that content as a sword,\" Wood said. AT...id not respond to a request for comment. As part of its strategy, the newly enlarged AT...ay in some cases limit some of its new videos and movies and other Time Warner content to its own subscribers. For example, it could potentially create new \"Harry Potter\" videos or shows involving characters from the DC comics universe and only allow its customers to watch them. If you were a customer of Verizon or some other service, you would be out of luck. But more frequently, it may try to ensure that its subscribers get the best experience with its movies, shows, and services. At the same time, it may also try to make sure that when consumers try to access its content through other companies' services, the experience is less than ideal. We've already seen a hint at that this year when AT...tarted offering HBO's streaming service for free with some of its unlimited wireless plans. You can still watch HBO if you have Verizon or T-Mobile, of course, but you won't be getting it for free. If AT...ontinues the promotion after it owns HBO, it will give the telecom giant an unfair advantage over its rivals. To do the same thing for their customers, they'd have to pay AT... assuming AT...ould even allow them to do that. And AT...ould do other things to give itself a leg up. It could make the experience of watching its rivals shows or accessing their services a worse experience than watching or accessing its own. Potentially, AT...ould make it harder for its customers to tune in Fox than CNN or the Disney Channel than TBS. Similar concerns were voiced at the beginning of this decade when Comcast was trying to buy NBC Universal. Just like we're seeing today, a cable and internet provider was attempting to snap up a company that controlled massive amounts of content. Michael Copps, then a commissioner with the Federal Communications Commission, which had oversight over the merger, worried at the time that the tie-up would put too much power into the hands of one giant corporation. In particular, Copps was worried about the effect the deal would have on Time Warner's newsrooms and news gathering. \"I had seen merger after merger come along where the costs were in the billions of dollars,\" said Copps, who ended up being the only one of the FCC's five commissioners who voted against the deal. \"A lot of these big companies turn to newsrooms as a way to cut costs.\" He continued: \"It's dumbed down our democratic dialogue.\" By merging with Time-Warner, AT...ould be in a similar position to dominate the way we get information and entertainment, with similar potential consequences. Indeed, it may be in a better position than Comcast was.\u00a0 AT...s developing an advanced mobile broadband service known as 5G that could one day replace the wired internet service you use today, which may well come from Comcast. And unlike Comcast, which only offers its traditional cable TV service in areas where it has coaxial cable lines, AT...ffers its competing DirecTV Now service to basically everyone in the US who has a broadband connection. Allowing AT...o gobble up Time Warner would put a company that already has a good deal of control over how we access media \u2014 and likely will soon have more \u2014 in charge of much of the media we access. For AT...ustomers, that will likely mean paying more down the road. For other consumers, it could also mean missing out on \"Game of Thrones\" or the next superhero show.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, organisations representing the print and broadcast media industries, and the Law Council all expressed serious misgivings.</p><p>But for the local tech community it was a particularly bitter pill to swallow. It was just the latest in a lengthening list of policy defeats the community has suffered in recent times. There was the defeat over encryption laws last year. Before that, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/startups-face-more-unknowns-as-breaks-put-on-r-and-d-changes-20190212-p50x54.html\">the clawing back of research and development tax breaks</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/grind-to-a-halt-tech-industry-sounds-alarm-over-457-visa-changes-20170419-gvng9a.html\">changes to the rules over highly skilled migration</url>.</p><p>Part of the problem is that in Canberra, \"tech\" more often than not means the branch offices of the US tech giants (think Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple). After all, these are the most substantial tech businesses operating in Australia. They employ thousands of people, generate billions of dollars in revenue and make products used by millions.</p><p>They are also deeply out of favour with politicians all around the world, and Australia is no exception. \"There is so little respect for them,\" one Canberra source says of Big Tech. \"Their kneejerk reaction to everything is 'regulation won't solve this'. But the government is jack of it.\"</p><p>The succession of recent scandals involving tech companies, and their fierce resistance to regulation (including over taxation) are finally coming home to roost. The local branches of Big Tech firms (government relations staff often report regional to offices in Singapore, and don't have major clout with headquarters in the US) are proving ill-equipped to deal with the backlash.</p><p>All of this is little comfort to Australia's homegrown tech community - a collection of scrappy start-ups and a handful of substantial companies headed by software firm Atlassian. These firms have very little in common with each other, let alone Big Tech, but unfortunately are indirectly being tarred with the same brush.</p><p>It's tempting to view the string of recent policy defeats as evidence our elected officials just don't understand tech and innovation - and that is certainly part of the problem. But here's the thing: our politicians don't understand a lot of things. (Have you ever watched a Senate estimates hearing? Or even just Question Time?) If you are starting from the premise that politicians will act logically you are already doing it wrong.</p><p>It also may be tempting to view this as a partisan issue that might be resolved if the Coalition loses power at the next election. Perhaps, but Labor voted for the legislation the local sector is most upset about, and has had its own howlers in the past (remember the Internet Filter?).</p><p>Navigating the shadowy corridors of power is one of the few areas where the tech scene can arguably learn from the old economy industries they seek to disrupt. Forging relationships, attending fundraisers, and so forth, isn't pretty work. But politics is a grubby game and to succeed at it you need to get your hands dirty.</p><p>\"Telco and media may not win every battle, but they certainly put up a better fight,\" one former staffer says. \"They know they are going to get regulated somehow, so they work with government to make it work. With tech, it's their way or the highway. Inevitably, it leads to a worse outcome\".</p><p>Every time legislation passes affecting the sector there are the veiled threats to leave Australia - which is not the way to endear yourself to politicians. As the Attorney General Christian Porter put it last week: \"It's like Alec Baldwin saying he's going to leave America every time a Republican is elected president - it just doesn't happen.\"</p><p>There are also arguments that the measures will cost jobs that don't yet exist. Again, the sentiment is valid but these are not winning arguments in the reductive world of politics.</p><p>Being good at lobbying is not a virtue that we should celebrate. Yet if the local tech sector really is the key to our future prosperity in a post mining economy, and if Canberra's bad policy is seriously threatening that, then it is becoming a necessary evil.</p><p>The Twitter diplomacy favoured by our most prominent tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists might be refreshing and entertaining (it also makes for good newspaper copy). But that alone isn't going to cut it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520113607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTY-8N51-JBJ7-N0MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the following TechFlash Q&amp;A, she explains the opportunity she sees that compelled her to leave Kleiner Perkins to invest in startups that are working at the intersection of technology, health and consumer businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>I started this early-stage fund focused on digital health in October 2018. We're really excited about the sector. I believe that we are in an unparalleled time of change in healthcare because of the confluence of three areas.</p><p>One is what I call the tech enablement of healthcare. Between artificial intelligence and machine learning, the interoperability of data that we see is truly enabling healthcare in a different way and is a very important driver of change and innovation.</p><p>The second is the change in the business of healthcare from a fee-for-service model to a value-based one. How people get paid and how the system is organized is changing very rapidly.</p><p>Third is what I call the consumerization of healthcare. Many consumers are paying more for healthcare because high-deductible plans make up around 30 percent of the market. Even more importantly, 70 percent of the U.S. population is Gen X and younger.\u00a0</p><p>These are generations that are used to technology being at the core of all of their interactions. They believe healthcare should be no different than transportation or housing or food. So they demand that healthcare should become more tech-enabled.</p><p>Healthcare as an industry has been slow to change. But we're seeing a lot of new business models, such as more direct-to-patient models that startups have been very successful with in the consumer world. I think startups are taking a lot of those pragmatic lessons and putting them in a real healthcare context.\u00a0</p><p>We see the large tech companies doing this as well. I don't think a month goes by without news that Apple, Google, and Amazon are making waves in this market. Tim Cook on an earnings call last year said he believed that Apple will be remembered for its impact on healthcare.</p><p>So we're seeing it from startups and we're seeing it from the big tech companies, but the industry itself also knows that it needs to change. Healthcare is an over $3 trillion spend and rising. So things need to change and the players want to change.\u00a0</p><p>We're also seeing traditional players change with vertical mergers such as Cigna buying ESI, as well as horizontal mergers in the space. Change is happening in all aspects, truly.</p><p>Beth Seidenberg (another Kleiner partner who has left the firm) and I worked together with Livongo for about a year and a half, but I was on their board solo for another two and a half years beyond that.\u00a0</p><p>I would say Livongo is a first-class example of digital therapeutics taking an integrated approach to delivering care. Livongo integrates hardware, software, and services to deliver an all-encompassing solution for patients for Type 2 diabetes. Then we innovated beyond that to become a chronic disease platform and expand into hypertension and mental behavioral health, as well.</p><p>Chronic disease is the biggest cost driver in the US healthcare system. About 60 percent of Americans have, or have had, a chronic disease. It is a huge market that we need to tackle and address.\u00a0</p><p>Digital therapeutics, which is what Livongo does, is absolutely within our investment scope at Define Ventures. We think it's a very big market. In addition to the integration of hardware, software and services</p><p>A key to their success is that everyone at Livongo took their blood glucose reading every day, so that they could live and breathe and truly understand what the consumer needed.\u00a0</p><p>Livongo also took from the tech world some untraditional aspects of design. We made things larger because we knew that the patient is typically older. We made the strips a little bit bigger.</p><p>Secondarily, we had a world-class team who really understood the healthcare market. They knew how to unlock growth in the market with the various consumer segments and enterprise segments that we unlocked. They really understood the ecosystem needs that helped to commercialize and grow the business.</p><p>Many of the people involved also had personal stories about diabetes. I had gestational diabetes when I had both of my two children. I used Livongo on myself. Founder Glen Tullman has a son with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0</p><p>I think what can motivate entrepreneurs in healthcare is these deeply personal stories. The mission and values that we're setting out to innovate on are deep at the core of many entrepreneurs in this space, but especially at Livongo.</p><p>Absolutely. This is not an if-you-build-it-they-will-come industry. You really have to understand and define your business model from Day 1, because this is a very complex ecosystem. You have to show who pays for the healthcare, who receives the healthcare and who administers the healthcare. All of these things are different players.\u00a0</p><p>You have to have a deep understanding. That's why at Define we live, breathe, and eat digital health. We know how to build the models that are needed to be successful for companies such as Livongo.\u00a0</p><p>Digital health is different than technology or other traditional healthcare because it really lives at the intersection of healthcare technology and the consumer world. Understanding that intersection is where healthcare is going.\u00a0</p><p>We have partnered with seven companies and entrepreneurs in this space. They have across a range of stages, from an incubation all the way to Series B companies.</p><p>One is a company called Hims, here in the Bay Area. It's a direct-to-consumer healthcare and wellness company that began by targeting men's products and then added a women's brand called Hers. It is led by Andrew Dudum. We feel very strongly that the direct-to-consumer model is a future model of healthcare. We believe in the consumerization of healthcare.</p><p>The first touchpoint of healthcare is no longer going to be the doctor's office. It's going to live and breathe like any other consumer experience you might have in other verticals. Hims is a best-in-class example of that. They were the first to A, be in the space, and they've grown quite a bit. They really understand the healthcare model and I think we helped contribute to that.</p><p>We introduced Hims to Toby Cosgrove, who was the ex-CEO of Cleveland Clinic. Toby has since joined the board of Hims. We've also been instrumental in introducing Hims to Ochsner Health System, a world-class health system here in the U.S. They announced a business development relationship in December 2019. So we've been really excited about the company, the market, and what they mean in defining healthcare. And we've been really excited about how we've defined partnership with them.</p><p>As an operator in healthcare for eight years, I launched 10 different product families in 40 different countries. I've seen how healthcare works in India, in Western Europe, in Japan and in China. I have been able to take those lessons and apply how the U.S. healthcare system might evolve in the future.</p><p>But another crucial lesson from that operating experience is understanding the importance of clinical regulatory reimbursement, operations and sales. I learned how to work with all of those functional groups and understanding them deeply, launching products from R&amp;D to commercialization.</p><p>One of the most important lessons is to have a true understanding of the entrepreneur, after having been an operator. Innovating in healthcare is one of the hardest verticals to do that in. Entrepreneurs in this space need people who really understand the space and who will sit in the trenches together with them.\u00a0</p><p>At Define, we define leadership by having an unrelenting operating attitude. We do that by partnering with our companies to help them grow and build. We were operators and we continue to approach what we do as operators.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

But contrary to conventional wisdom the FCC's \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" order didn't just kill \"net neutrality\": it neutered the FCC's authority over ISPs, ceding much of its remaining power to an FTC that lacks the authority or resources[3] to really police bad behavior in telecom (the whole point). Those who continue to insist the repeal couldn't have been that bad because the internet didn't immediately explode[4] only advertise their ignorance to the scope of what the telecom lobby actually accomplished. Again, the telecom industry didn't just eliminate net neutrality rules (after allegedly trying to stuff the FCC website comment ballet box[5] using fake[6] and dead[7] people), they eliminated most oversight of some of the most predatory, uncompetitive, and disliked[8] companies in America. We effectively took the very ideas that helped create monopolies like Comcast[9], and doubled down. </p><p>Should it be allowed to stand, the FCC's repeal leaves telecom giants (with two decades of anti-competitive behavior under their belts) free from both competition and meaningful regulatory accountability. If you don't see the problem there, you probably haven't spent much time looking at your broadband bill, watching AT...o business[10], or talking to Comcast customer support. With a few exceptions (like AT...sing its usage caps to harm competitors[11] like Netflix, or Centurylink blocking internet access[12] to spam its own security products), most ISPs have tried to be on their best behavior in the year since. Why? They're worried about state laws[13] that popped up to protect consumers in the wake of FCC apathy. They're also worried about the lawsuit by 23 AGs filed against the FCC[14], a ruling in which is expected any day now. Should the FCC lose, the FCC's 2015 rules could be fully restored. ISPs don't want to significantly change their business models at scale only to have the rules pop back up declaring them in violation. As a result ISPs are just biding their time, waiting for the full green light to behave anti-competitively. They've spent some of that time getting their biggest sycophants in Congress to push bogus net neutrality laws[15] framed as serious attempts at \"bipartisan consensus\" intended to \"put the issue to bed.\" In reality these bills, literally written by industry, only serve one purpose: pre-empt tougher state or federal efforts to protect net neutrality. Such bills are filled with loopholes[16] and the tech policy equivalent of a head fake. In reality, this Congress has made it very clear it will never pass a net neutrality law with any real teeth. Case in point: some lawmakers spent the repeal anniversary trying to get Mitch McConnell[17] to floor a genuine, three-page bill (the Save the Internet Act) that would simply restore the FCC rules. But while that bill passed the House last April[18], it has little to no hope passing the telecom-campaign-cash-slathered Senate, where McConnell has declared the bill \"dead on arrival.\" As such, the best hope for restoring the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules rests with the ongoing lawsuit. Should the lawsuit fail, the onus lies with voters to 1) purge Congress of Luddites and telecom lackeys that have repeatedly made it clear that the public interest and Democratic process does not matter to them, and 2) push this new Congress to pass a real net neutrality law down the road. Either way, this is a problem that's not going away for the telecom industry or anybody forced to do business with them. With US telcos refusing to upgrade or repair[19] their aging DSL lines, cable giants like Comcast and Charter are securing bigger regional monopolies than ever[20] across much of the United States (and no, 5G wireless isn't going to magically fix the problem[21]). Emboldened by a lack of regulatory oversight and little real competition, they won't be able to help themselves, and will inevitably try to take full advantage in new and creatively stupid ways. For example, it's not hard to envision some if the controversial \"zero rating\" shenanigans we've seen in the video space[22] impacting innovative, emerging businesses like game streaming. ISPs are busy cooking up their own challengers[23] to cloud gaming efforts like Google Stadia[24] (which eliminates home hardware and devours bandwidth[25] by moving all processing to the cloud). Given precedent, you can be fairly sure ISPs will ensure usage caps apply to competing services, but not their own products. They're already doing it with video, why wouldn't they elsewhere? Those who have foolishly claimed[26] net neutrality rules weren't important because the Earth didn't immediately stop rotating on its axis don't understand that this has always been a slow death by a thousand cuts scenario. First, ISPs get consumers used to monthly usage caps and overage fees that have no valid technical justification[27]. Then, they begin using those caps to disadvantage their competitors[28] (which again is already happening). From there, they get consumers used to being nickel-and-dimed by charging you more money to view HD video streams as intended[29], or to avoid having your games, music, or video throttled[30]. We're already well down the rabbit hole, and most of these \"net neutrality doesn't matter\" folks haven't even noticed (or worse, are foolishly cheering as they stumble and bumble their way down the slippery slope). Anti-competitive shenanigans aside, the FCC's 2015 rules also required that ISPs be more transparent about what kind of connection you're buying. The repeal made it harder to determine whether services will be throttled or banned outright[31], because ISPs no longer face any real penalty for lying to you[32]. And with the FCC's authority eroded and the FTC too busy to police telecom seriously, nobody will do much about other bad behavior in the sector, be it wireless carrier abuse of your location data[33], or the ISP tendency to sign customers up for scam services they never asked for[34]. While States may pick up some consumer protection slack, the FCC's repeal also attempts to strip states of that ability[35] as well. The telecom lobby goal is no competition and no federal or state oversight. A perfect vacuum. See the problem yet? While Facebook's issues are undeniable, the recent exclusive fixation on Facebook[36] as the root of all evil in tech policy circles has been a huge gift to the telecom lobby. Telecom lobbyists have been pushing for the hyper regulation of companies they hope to compete with in the video ad space[37], hoping you don't notice they just convinced government to obliterate oversight of their own businesses, despite its natural monopoly problems and ad ambitions every bit as problematic[38] as Facebook's. Silicon Valley and telecom share many of the same problems, including the abysmal treatment of consumer privacy[39]. But telecom is always going to be unique in that its customers are entirely captive. You might be able to fix this by simply pushing for policies that bring more competition to market, but history has repeatedly shown how that's difficult with a Congress slathered in campaign contributions from the likes of AT...Verizon, Comcast, and Spectrum. Those \"bored\" by the net neutrality debate miss the broader implications. And those applauding the rules' demise are usually oblivious to not only what the rules did, but the fact they're actively cheering against their own best self interests. Net neutrality isn't something that just goes away with the passage or the elimination of rules, and violations are just another in a long line of symptoms of a broken telecom market we refuse to fix due to rampant corruption. No period in tech and telecom policy history has done a better job driving that point home.Permalink[40] | Comments[41] | Email This Story[42] [ 1]: <url

You so badly want to be its best friend, but yet it remains unattainable. With a population of over 1.4 billion, combined with its recent economic growth and approximately more than 1 billion smartphone users,\u00a0China is a tempting market for Western companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nevertheless, even globally successful companies fall flat in China. So, why do some Western firms do well in the country while others fail miserably?</p><p>Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies have encountered tremendous difficulties or outright failure in their China expansion plans, with Facebook and Google as just two examples. While government preference toward local firms is only part of the reason, that rationale alone doesn\u2019t explain the whole picture. Other roadblocks that have stood in the way include language barrier, high entry fees for U.S. businesses and tough local market nuances. Foreign firms often trip up on some of these key customs and business traits.</p><p>Guanxi is the Chinese term for business relationships. In China, business success is often determined more by who you know versus what you do and how your product or service is different. While the U.S. has a very diplomatic business culture, in China it\u2019s much more direct and frank.\u00a0</p><p>This is a key lesson for any business that elects to enter the Chinese market. While government entities in the U.S. may be more inclined toward a laissez-faire attitude of regulating businesses, that is not the case in China typically. A \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mentality doesn\u2019t work well.</p><p>In many Western nations, companies succeed through niche targeting and are known to be good at connecting with specific groups of people exclusively. This approach doesn\u2019t work in China, as it\u2019s a market built on scale. Chinese customers typically don\u2019t expect perfection, instead preferring mass appeal. A recent research study identifies a lack of understanding of local market conditions are one of the three most common ways Western digital-focused firms fail in China.</p><p>The Chinese market is rapidly evolving and has proven to have a large appetite for new products and services. Companies that succeed in this market are constantly innovating and often release new products at least two to four times a year, a much faster pace than in the U.S. or Europe.</p><p>For example, consider the rise of smart TVs and OTT in China versus the rest of the world. In 2017, 45 percent of households in China had a smart TV while just under 29 percent of households in the U.S. had a dedicated smart TV device. Chinese manufacturers like Skyworth and Hisense subsidize smart TV prices through advertising, enabling them to reach a wide audience through affordable hardware costs without losing out on revenue.\u00a0</p><p>This Mandarin phrase roughly means \u201ckeep their feet firmly on the ground.\u201d\u00a0In short, many Western firms have entered China\u2014or attempted to enter the market\u2014thinking that it would be a fairly simple process and that their globally dominating technology would make a big splash in this market. But this kind of hubris fails to take local innovations, the relative lack of name recognition and the hyper-competitive local market into account.\u00a0</p><p>In many spaces, Western firms are caught off guard by the sheer number of competitors they go up against in China. While big tech companies had to best at most hundreds or dozens of competitors in North America, Feng Li, a professor at City University of London\u2019s Cass Business School, noted that the same firm will have thousands of competitors or more in China.\u00a0Businesses that fail to appreciate the scope of the local market are unlikely to emerge victorious over savvier firms.</p><p>Companies looking to expand into China have to take careful and considerate measures to make it a successful entry. Applying a mobile-first and mobile only strategy is key, as a vast majority of Chinese internet users go online via mobile devices and apps. Trying to shoehorn a desktop-based system into such a landscape is fraught with perils. For example, consider the rise of micro apps, apps within super apps like Alipay. In particular, WeChat alone has 580,000 apps within its own app environment, highlighting the mobile-centric nature of China.</p><p>Any company with expansion plans should choose its China team very strategically by hiring staff with both international experience as well as local knowledge to create a local and autonomous team. Not only should individuals have a deep understanding of the country, but they should also be given wide leeway to implement products and methodologies specifically with China in mind. Companies see growth in China when efforts are spearheaded by those who know the market well and are enabled with the flexibility necessary to adapt.</p><p>While many companies see China as one large market, this fails to take into account local and regional nuances and needs. China is a very diverse and geographically vast country with preferences and needs varying by and even within provinces. Firms can succeed if they carefully consider their expansion plans by province and city.</p><p>While joint ventures can be tempting for foreign businesses since they eliminate operational burdens, they leave the international company at the mercy of Chinese partners. Companies should be selectively open to collaboration. Firms are best avoiding this temptation; however, this doesn\u2019t mean collaboration with local players shouldn\u2019t happen at all. For example, partnerships with local Chinese analytics firms can be fruitful and can be an advantage to companies looking to expand into China. It can also help Chinese firms expand operations overseas.</p><p>This is especially the case with ad buying in China versus the U.S., as the Chinese market has huge trust issues. While U.S. advertisers and agencies rely heavily on third-party verification, advertisers in China prefer to experiment with publisher audiences to see for themselves what will work best for their agenda.</p><p>As one eBay executive noted, \u201cIt\u2019s death by a thousand cuts\u201d when it comes to China. Businesses need to do lots of things right in order to get a foothold and succeed in the country.</p><p>Chinese operations can be enormously successful, so long as expansion occurs in a thoughtful and diligent manner with their needs front of mind. As always, the customer is always right. Companies must be respectful of local laws and customs surrounding business and let those who deeply and thoroughly know the Chinese market lead initiatives. For ad-tech companies to be successful, they must make China a main focus: Don\u2019t let the market be an afterthought.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-997643</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9D-DRX1-JC8H-T2T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 28, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Consider the systemic impact of energy and EROEI\u00a0(energy returned on energy invested).2. Consider the systemic impact of fast-rising private and public debt.3. Consider the systemic impact of rising inflation resulting from state-cartel capitalism;\u00a0the only possible output of state-cartel capitalism is a higher cost structure for' the entire economy.4. Consider that consumption is exhausted\u00a0because everyone already has everything--the utility of more consumption is increasingly marginal.5. Understand the perspective of employers and marginalized workers.\u00a0Most economists are safely inside the well-paid protected castles of academia or government, and so they have no real experience of being an entrepreneur or employer. They have no real grasp of how difficult it is to start a business or operate a business at a profit.Let's review these one at a time.\u00a0As Gail Tverberg of\u00a0Our Finite World[1]\u00a0has explained in great depth (Energy limits: Why we see rising wealth disparity and low prices[2]\u00a0and\u00a0Overly Simple Energy-Economy Models Give Misleading Answers[3]), as EROEI declines and debt rises, there's less economic output available to pay workers.In other words, the only possible output of declining EROEI and rising debt is stagnant or declining wages.As for fast-rising debt:\u00a0debt is nothing but future spending brought forward.Future earnings must be devoted to paying interest and paying down the debt. That leaves less money available for spending in the future. How difficult is that to grasp? Apparently it is impossible to grasp, judging by the Keynesian Cargo Cult of Paul Krugman and his fellow Cargo Cultists, who are busy staring at radio dials painted on rocks and declaring that the answer to everything is more debt.The key feature of monopoly and state-cartel capitalism is ever-rising costs for everything controlled by monopolies, cartels or the state.\u00a0Since these are the dominant structures in our economy, the\u00a0cost basis of the entire economy rises even though output doesn't rise.\u00a0In other words, we pay more for the same goods and services.Mainstream economists cannot admit that demand is exhausted because demand is the foundation of all \"growth.\"\u00a0I have often explained why demand is systemically stagnating, along with \"growth\":\u00a0Here's Why the Status Quo Is Doomed[4](September 2015)The world is shifting from\u00a0unlimited growth\u00a0to limits and\u00a0Degrowth:Degrowth, Anti-Consumerism and Peak Consumption[5]\u00a0(May 9, 2013)When Conventional Success Is No Longer Possible, Degrowth and the Black Market Beckon[6]\u00a0(February 7, 2014)And the Next Big Thing Is ... Degrowth?[7]\u00a0(April 7, 2014)Conventional economists may have an abstract understanding of business costs and regulatory burdens, but they have no life experience in actually earning a profit in a high-cost, state-cartel-dominated, globalized marketplace.Being well-educated and well-paid, they have minimal contact with real-world marginalized workers.\u00a0I personally know numerous young men and women in their 20s who live at home and are effectively out of the labor force. They could work but choose not to, or they can only find part-time work that can't support an independent household or they scrape by on earnings in the\u00a0gig economy\u00a0or the black market.Whether economists care to measure this or not, the reality is many people choose not to work rather than take a minimum wage job that requires a long commute and hard labor. They consider it \"not worth my time,\" demeaning, too difficult, etc. It's much easier to live at home and let Mom and Dad pay the bills, and make pocket money in the black market or from occasional gigs.Others are willing to work in minimum-wage jobs but they don't live near job-rich areas or they lack the cultural and social values and skills required by employers: for example, the ability to show up on time, get along with other workers, etc.There are few \"easy jobs\" in the private-sector economy.\u00a0To eke out a profit, employers demand a lot of workers, from fast-food employees all the way up the chain to corporate managers. The reality is that modern work is challenging, requires multiple skills and a solid set of values. Many people lack the ability and/or will to function effectively in these conditions.From the employer's point of view, regulatory burdens and the soaring cost of labor overhead make it increasingly difficult to stay afloat.\u00a0From the small cafe owner trimming workers' hours to global corporations laying off thousands of employees, the reality is that earning a profit is increasingly difficult for all but a handful of big-tech quasi-monopolies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook.To hire someone at $15/hour, an employee must get at least $45/hour of value from each hour of employee labor.\u00a0The employer has labor overhead costs--Social Security/Medicare, healthcare, unemployment, 401K/pension payments, liability insurance, etc.--plus the direct overhead of rent, production and the back office (accounting, regulatory compliance, etc.).Then there's all the taxes and junk fees that must be paid \"because you business owners are rich and can afford it.\"This chart shows the reality: new business formation is collapsing because it's an increasingly risky wager to start and operate a new business.\u00a0The mainstream lauds the entrepreneur and the media glorifies a handful of tech billionaires, but for the bottom 99% of enterprises, it's a struggle that is increasingly not worth the risk, hours, stress, anxiety and hassle. At some point, for health and financial reasons, the only way to survive is shutter the business and lay off the employees.No wonder wages as a percentage of the economy have been declining for decades.\u00a0Global corporations have the advantages of financialization and globalization, but everyone else is staggering under the weight of higher taxes, higher costs and heavier regulatory burdens.The only way to reverse declines in labor participation and stagnation in wages is to make it easier to start enterprises and hire people, and dramatically lower the cost basis of the entire economy.\u00a0There is scant evidence that policymakers have any real interest in either of these goals or any knowledge of how to make them happen, despite the abundance of lip-service paid to \"business-friendly\" strategies.Alternatively, we need a new system for providing paid work (and the dignity that comes with work) like the one I describe in my book\u00a0A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology and Creating Jobs for All[8].

Download the Scutify iOS App[2], the Scutify Android App[3] or visit Scutify.com.[4]The only way to reverse declines in labor participation and stagnation in wages and demand is to make it easier to start enterprises and hire people.Mainstream economists are mystified why wages/salaries are still stagnant after 7+ years of growth / \"recovery.\" The conventional view is that wages should be rising as the labor market tightens (i.e. the unemployment rate is low) and demand for workers increases in an expanding economy.But wages are only rising significantly for the top 5%, while workers between the bottom 81% who have seen their household incomes decline and the top 5% are experiencing stagnant earnings.We can see how the top 5% have pulled away from the bottom 95% by examining household budgets: spending by the top 5% has soared compared to the stagnant spending of the bottom 95%.In effect, productivity gains have accrued to the top 5%. This chart shows that while productivity has advanced, household income has remained flat.Mainstream economists are also puzzled about the decline in labor participation. </p><p>The percentage of the labor force that is employed or seeking work has plummeted despite 16 years of economic expansion:Conventional economists look to labor market supply and demand for answers--and have come up empty. They can't explain why labor supply--people of working age that are actively in the labor force--keeps declining in a growing economy.They are equally flummoxed by stagnant demand for goods and services: in an expanding economy, rising demand should spur higher demand for workers that should eventually push wages higher.These higher wages should attract non-participants to rejoin the labor force and fuel higher demand for goods and services.Instead, people are dropping out of the labor force, wages are stagnant for all but the top layer and demand is weak as well. This creates multiple serious long-term problems for the U.S. economy: if fewer people are working, wages will continue to decline as a percentage of the economy, which is precisely what has been happening for decades (see chart below).If earnings and household incomes for the bottom 95% stagnate, these households cannot afford to borrow and spend more money--and that's why demand is tepid except when the purchases are financed at 0%.If the top 5% garner most of the productivity gains, their spending must support consumption. That's a much shakier foundation for demand than 80% of the households participating in wage gains.The reason why mainstream economists don't understand these developments is they don't:1. Consider the systemic impact of energy and EROEI (energy returned on energy invested).2. Consider the systemic impact of fast-rising private and public debt.3. Consider the systemic impact of rising inflation resulting from state-cartel capitalism; the only possible output of state-cartel capitalism is a higher cost structure for' the entire economy.4. Consider that consumption is exhausted because everyone already has everything--the utility of more consumption is increasingly marginal.5. Understand the perspective of employers and marginalized workers. Most economists are safely inside the well-paid protected castles of academia or government, and so they have no real experience of being an entrepreneur or employer. They have no real grasp of how difficult it is to start a business or operate a business at a profit.Let's review these one at a time. As Gail Tverberg of Our Finite World[5] has explained in great depth (Energy limits: Why we see rising wealth disparity and low prices[6] and Overly Simple Energy-Economy Models Give Misleading Answers[7]), as EROEI declines and debt rises, there's less economic output available to pay workers.In other words, the only possible output of declining EROEI and rising debt is stagnant or declining wages.As for fast-rising debt: debt is nothing but future spending brought forward.Future earnings must be devoted to paying interest and paying down the debt. That leaves less money available for spending in the future. How difficult is that to grasp? Apparently it is impossible to grasp, judging by the Keynesian Cargo Cult of Paul Krugman and his fellow Cargo Cultists, who are busy staring at radio dials painted on rocks and declaring that the answer to everything is more debt.The key feature of monopoly and state-cartel capitalism is ever-rising costs for everything controlled by monopolies, cartels or the state. Since these are the dominant structures in our economy, the cost basis of the entire economy rises even though output doesn't rise. In other words, we pay more for the same goods and services.Mainstream economists cannot admit that demand is exhausted because demand is the foundation of all \"growth.\" I have often explained why demand is systemically stagnating, along with \"growth\": Here's Why the Status Quo Is Doomed[8](September 2015)The world is shifting from unlimited growth to limits and Degrowth:Degrowth, Anti-Consumerism and Peak Consumption[9] (May 9, 2013)When Conventional Success Is No Longer Possible, Degrowth and the Black Market Beckon[10] (February 7, 2014)And the Next Big Thing Is ... Degrowth?[11] (April 7, 2014)Conventional economists may have an abstract understanding of business costs and regulatory burdens, but they have no life experience in actually earning a profit in a high-cost, state-cartel-dominated, globalized marketplace.Being well-educated and well-paid, they have minimal contact with real-world marginalized workers. I personally know numerous young men and women in their 20s who live at home and are effectively out of the labor force. They could work but choose not to, or they can only find part-time work that can't support an independent household or they scrape by on earnings in the gig economy or the black market.Whether economists care to measure this or not, the reality is many people choose not to work rather than take a minimum wage job that requires a long commute and hard labor. They consider it \"not worth my time,\" demeaning, too difficult, etc. It's much easier to live at home and let Mom and Dad pay the bills, and make pocket money in the black market or from occasional gigs.Others are willing to work in minimum-wage jobs but they don't live near job-rich areas or they lack the cultural and social values and skills required by employers: for example, the ability to show up on time, get along with other workers, etc.There are few \"easy jobs\" in the private-sector economy. To eke out a profit, employers demand a lot of workers, from fast-food employees all the way up the chain to corporate managers. The reality is that modern work is challenging, requires multiple skills and a solid set of values. Many people lack the ability and/or will to function effectively in these conditions.From the employer's point of view, regulatory burdens and the soaring cost of labor overhead make it increasingly difficult to stay afloat. From the small cafe owner trimming workers' hours to global corporations laying off thousands of employees, the reality is that earning a profit is increasingly difficult for all but a handful of big-tech quasi-monopolies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook.To hire someone at $15/hour, an employee must get at least $45/hour of value from each hour of employee labor. The employer has labor overhead costs--Social Security/Medicare, healthcare, unemployment, 401K/pension payments, liability insurance, etc.--plus the direct overhead of rent, production and the back office (accounting, regulatory compliance, etc.).Then there's all the taxes and junk fees that must be paid \"because you business owners are rich and can afford it.\"This chart shows the reality: new business formation is collapsing because it's an increasingly risky wager to start and operate a new business. The mainstream lauds the entrepreneur and the media glorifies a handful of tech billionaires, but for the bottom 99% of enterprises, it's a struggle that is increasingly not worth the risk, hours, stress, anxiety and hassle. At some point, for health and financial reasons, the only way to survive is shutter the business and lay off the employees.No wonder wages as a percentage of the economy have been declining for decades. Global corporations have the advantages of financialization and globalization, but everyone else is staggering under the weight of higher taxes, higher costs and heavier regulatory burdens.The only way to reverse declines in labor participation and stagnation in wages is to make it easier to start enterprises and hire people, and dramatically lower the cost basis of the entire economy. There is scant evidence that policymakers have any real interest in either of these goals or any knowledge of how to make them happen, despite the abundance of lip-service paid to \"business-friendly\" strategies.Alternatively, we need a new system for providing paid work (and the dignity that comes with work) like the one I describe in my book A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology and Creating Jobs for All[12].

View original post here[2].Despite the claims by Obama, Clinton, and therefore the mainstream media, the continuing lack of reported wage pressures highlights the lack of quality in the job generation in America. As CLSA's Chris Wood details, lower paying jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector and the retail trade sector increased by 421,000 and 289,000 jobs respectively over the past 12 months, while the higher paying jobs in the information and utilities sectors increased by only 27,000 and 6,000 jobs over the same period       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/08/07/20160814_chs1.jpg\">http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/08/07/20160814_chs1.jpg</url> And so, as Charles Hugh-Smith via OfTwoMinds blog explains,[3] the only way to reverse declines in labor participation and stagnation in wages and demand is to make it easier to start enterprises and hire people. Mainstream economists are mystified why wages/salaries are still stagnant after 7+ years of growth / 'recovery.' </p><p>The conventional view is that wages should be rising as the labor market tightens (i.e. the unemployment rate is low) and demand for workers increases in an expanding economy. But wages are only rising significantly for the top 5%, while workers between the bottom 81% who have seen their household incomes decline and the top 5% are experiencing stagnant earnings.We can see how the top 5% have pulled away from the bottom 95% by examining household budgets: spending by the top 5% has soared compared to the stagnant spending of the bottom 95%.In effect, productivity gains have accrued to the top 5%. This chart shows that while productivity has advanced, household income has remained flat.Mainstream economists are also puzzled about the decline in labor participation. The percentage of the labor force that is employed or seeking work has plummeted despite 16 years of economic expansion:Conventional economists look to labor market supply and demand for answers--and have come up empty. They can't explain why labor supply--people of working age that are actively in the labor force--keeps declining in a growing economy. They are equally flummoxed by stagnant demand for goods and services: in an expanding economy, rising demand should spur higher demand for workers that should eventually push wages higher. These higher wages should attract non-participants to rejoin the labor force and fuel higher demand for goods and services. Instead, people are dropping out of the labor force, wages are stagnant for all but the top layer and demand is weak as well. This creates multiple serious long-term problems for the U.S. economy: if fewer people are working, wages will continue to decline as a percentage of the economy, which is precisely what has been happening for decades (see chart below). If earnings and household incomes for the bottom 95% stagnate, these households cannot afford to borrow and spend more money--and that's why demand is tepid except when the purchases are financed at 0%. If the top 5% garner most of the productivity gains, their spending must support consumption. That's a much shakier foundation for demand than 80% of the households participating in wage gains. The reason why mainstream economists don't understand these developments is they don't:  1. Consider the systemic impact of energy and EROEI (energy returned on energy invested). 2. Consider the systemic impact of fast-rising private and public debt. 3. Consider the systemic impact of rising inflation resulting from state-cartel capitalism; the only possible output of state-cartel capitalism is a higher cost structure for' the entire economy. 4. Consider that consumption is exhausted because everyone already has everything--the utility of more consumption is increasingly marginal. 5. Understand the perspective of employers and marginalized workers. Most economists are safely inside the well-paid protected castles of academia or government, and so they have no real experience of being an entrepreneur or employer. They have no real grasp of how difficult it is to start a business or operate a business at a profit. Let's review these one at a time. As Gail Tverberg of Our Finite World[4] has explained in great depth (Energy limits: Why we see rising wealth disparity and low prices[5] and Overly Simple Energy-Economy Models Give Misleading Answers[6]), as EROEI declines and debt rises, there's less economic output available to pay workers. In other words, the only possible output of declining EROEI and rising debt is stagnant or declining wages. As for fast-rising debt: debt is nothing but future spending brought forward. Future earnings must be devoted to paying interest and paying down the debt. That leaves less money available for spending in the future. How difficult is that to grasp? Apparently it is impossible to grasp, judging by the Keynesian Cargo Cult of Paul Krugman and his fellow Cargo Cultists, who are busy staring at radio dials painted on rocks and declaring that the answer to everything is more debt. The key feature of monopoly and state-cartel capitalism is ever-rising costs for everything controlled by monopolies, cartels or the state. Since these are the dominant structures in our economy, the cost basis of the entire economy rises even though output doesn't rise. In other words, we pay more for the same goods and services. Mainstream economists cannot admit that demand is exhausted because demand is the foundation of all 'growth.' I have often explained why demand is systemically stagnating, along with 'growth': Here's Why the Status Quo Is Doomed[7] (September 2015) The world is shifting from unlimited growth to limits and Degrowth: Degrowth, Anti-Consumerism and Peak Consumption[8] (May 9, 2013) When Conventional Success Is No Longer Possible, Degrowth and the Black Market Beckon[9] (February 7, 2014) And the Next Big Thing Is Degrowth?[10] (April 7, 2014) Conventional economists may have an abstract understanding of business costs and regulatory burdens, but they have no life experience in actually earning a profit in a high-cost, state-cartel-dominated, globalized marketplace. Being well-educated and well-paid, they have minimal contact with real-world marginalized workers. I personally know numerous young men and women in their 20s who live at home and are effectively out of the labor force. They could work but choose not to, or they can only find part-time work that can't support an independent household or they scrape by on earnings in the gig economy or the black market. Whether economists care to measure this or not, the reality is many people choose not to work rather than take a minimum wage job that requires a long commute and hard labor. They consider it 'not worth my time,' demeaning, too difficult, etc. It's much easier to live at home and let Mom and Dad pay the bills, and make pocket money in the black market or from occasional gigs. Others are willing to work in minimum-wage jobs but they don't live near job-rich areas or they lack the cultural and social values and skills required by employers: for example, the ability to show up on time, get along with other workers, etc. There are few 'easy jobs' in the private-sector economy. To eke out a profit, employers demand a lot of workers, from fast-food employees all the way up the chain to corporate managers. The reality is that modern work is challenging, requires multiple skills and a solid set of values. Many people lack the ability and/or will to function effectively in these conditions. From the employer's point of view, regulatory burdens and the soaring cost of labor overhead make it increasingly difficult to stay afloat. From the small cafe owner trimming workers' hours to global corporations laying off thousands of employees, the reality is that earning a profit is increasingly difficult for all but a handful of big-tech quasi-monopolies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook. To hire someone at $15/hour, an employee must get at least $45/hour of value from each hour of employee labor. The employer has labor overhead costs--Social Security/Medicare, healthcare, unemployment, 401K/pension payments, liability insurance, etc.--plus the direct overhead of rent, production and the back office (accounting, regulatory compliance, etc.). Then there's all the taxes and junk fees that must be paid 'because you business owners are rich and can afford it.' This chart shows the reality: new business formation is collapsing because it's an increasingly risky wager to start and operate a new business. The mainstream lauds the entrepreneur and the media glorifies a handful of tech billionaires, but for the bottom 99% of enterprises, it's a struggle that is increasingly not worth the risk, hours, stress, anxiety and hassle. At some point, for health and financial reasons, the only way to survive is shutter the business and lay off the employees.No wonder wages as a percentage of the economy have been declining for decades. Global corporations have the advantages of financialization and globalization, but everyone else is staggering under the weight of higher taxes, higher costs and heavier regulatory burdens.The only way to reverse declines in labor participation and stagnation in wages is to make it easier to start enterprises and hire people, and dramatically lower the cost basis of the entire economy. There is scant evidence that policymakers have any real interest in either of these goals or any knowledge of how to make them happen, despite the abundance of lip-service paid to 'business-friendly' strategies.

Last year it made 64 M...eals, according to Mergermarket and Clarity research, equivalent to 48% of the total deals made across the big six global advertising agency networks in 2014. WPP plans to spend a further \u00a3300 million to \u00a3400 million on acquisitions in 2015, the company confirmed on its latest earnings call.&lt;nl/&gt; But a lot of the recent deals WPP has completed haven't been 100% takeover deals: Back in September WPP invested $25 million in cash for a 15% stake in adtech company AppNexus[2]; in October, it took a 16.7% stake in television measurement firm Rentrak[3] in exchange for WPP's Kantar Media US TV measurement business; and most recently WPP undertook another complex deal that will see it owning between 15% and 19.9% of US-based internet measurement company comScore[4].&lt;nl/&gt; As Sir Martin Sorrell said on WPP's fourth quarter earnings call: \"We are not big plonkers. We don't plonk down large amounts of cash to 100% acquire particularly public companies with limitations on how earn-outs can be structured and of course, on people. If you look at these technology companies, a very significant amount of the costs each year are share substitutes. Share-based compensation plays a very big important part, and paying 100% upfront for a company does leave you particularly vulnerable in the big tech area.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Dunnhumby isn't a public company, but it is majority-owned by Tesco, which is. Given WPP's recent acquisitions in what it describes as the \"new media and data investment management\" space, it is likely a deal with Dunnhumby would follow a similar, less risky path of taking small stakes, coupled in with a long-term partnership agreement.&lt;nl/&gt;Dunnhumby&lt;nl/&gt;Dunnhumby rightly has a high market value. It is the company that invented the Tesco Clubcard loyalty program in 1994. Besides that, it has data on almost 1 billion shoppers worldwide and a set of advanced analytics tools that help brands set their prices, choose which products to launch next, and make decisions on setting promotions. Its clients include Coca-Cola, Procter ...mble, and Diageo.&lt;nl/&gt; But handing itself over fully to WPP might be a difficult cultural fit for the 26-year-old Dunnhumby, which has more than 3,000 employees worldwide.&lt;nl/&gt; Stuart Evans, director of the global loyalty practice at ICLP Loyalty, told Business Insider: \"[A full takeover would] be a cultural inversion, from a business that has been very successful, somewhat comfortable, and extremely profitable almost by default to one that now needs to meet the WPP financial performance and sales growth targets, every week and month.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Evans estimates Dunnhumby makes \u00a350 million in profit per year.&lt;nl/&gt; He adds: \"Loyalty, however, is a strategy not a tactic and as such can't be 'sold' by hunter closers as a service to clients. [Loyalty] needs nurturing and farming given it is highly consultative in nature, it is not just designing campaigns and cards. The uncomfortable clash of cultures may well be most apparent in the weekly group sales meeting and end of month EBITDA reviews, close scrutiny of which drives the financial success of WPP.\"&lt;nl/&gt;Tesco&lt;nl/&gt;Tesco, which first took a stake in Dunnhumby in 2001 before taking full control of the business in 2004, has indicated it is exploring all options, including a full sale, a partial sell-off, or a float on the stock market.&lt;nl/&gt; The ailing supermarket is essentially looking to take the least painful path for turning around its business, having announced a \u00a3250 million over-estimate in its profits in September and successive like-for-like sales declines[5]. Its turnaround plan so far has included the closure of unprofitable stores, canceling new store openings, reducing capital investment, and selling off its entertainment streaming service Blinkbox[6] to UK telecommunications company TalkTalk for \u00a35 million.&lt;nl/&gt; But a simple sell-off of Dunnhumby might not be as straightforward.&lt;nl/&gt; Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, told Business Insider: \"Clearly Tesco will be looking for considerable protection whoever buys Dunnhumby because it is holding global data proprietary to Tesco at the minute, and in that respect it's not as straightforward a deal as people might think. Tesco has indicated it is interested to sell part if not all of Dunnhumby and we expect a lot of potential suitors. I'm not sure there'd be huge regulatory issues, but to my mind it's more about the comfort Tesco would want.\"&lt;nl/&gt; If Tesco were to shed Dunnhumby 100%, it would then need to become a Dunnhumby client for the supply of data and marketing services for Clubcard, which would come at a cost to both Tesco and its clients.&lt;nl/&gt; ICLP Loyalty's Evans believes the majority of Dunnhumby's profit comes from reselling Tesco's insight and data to CPG (consumer packaged goods) companies, so a full sale would further complicate the matter: \"How can Tesco sell that or who would buy it knowing they would be locked into a service contract at exceptionally low rates presumably \u2014 even if it gives that business Tesco as a reference client and potentially a loss leader therefore?\"&lt;nl/&gt; WPP isn't the only company with an interest in buying up Dunnhumby. But the complexity of its business and its relationship with Tesco means, whatever the outcome, the next stage for Dunnhumby won't be a straightforward sale.&lt;nl/&gt;NOW WATCH: Steve Jobs'

Council Chief Executive Officer Amb Yvonne Khamati-Yahaya (pictured above) said the move goes a long way in reinforcing what the country and council believes in. \u201cWe believe our heroes deserve better. They have played their part in nation-building. We must affirm them at all times so that we can inculcate the culture of Heroism, the culture of service. That is the spirit of the Kenya National Heroes Act, 2014 and what we stand for as a Council,\u201d she said.  SEE ALSO: Big Tech CEOs to defend their companies before US Congress by listing competitors  She added they will ensure more of female heroines are unearthed, highlighted and feted. \u201cOther than giving birth to many celebrated our women were at the forefront of our liberation, our struggles and our future remains solely in their hands.\u201d On Sunday, Google honoured Menza through a special doodle. Menza is known for inspiring Giriama people to resist colonial rule in the early 20th century.  \u201cDoodles provide a way for Google to connect with its users by helping them celebrate important moments and heroes,\u201d said Dorothy Ooko, Head of Communications and Public Affairs, Africa. Google began honouring people, events, anniversaries, and holidays with Doodles designed by one of its engineers in 1999. They have honoured several African personalities such as Margaret Ogola, the award-winning author, medical doctor, and human rights advocate; Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize winner and world-renowned environmentalist; South African singer and activist Miriam Makeba; and Stephen Keshi, former captain and coach of the Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s national football team.  SEE ALSO: Big Tech CEOs to defend their companies before U.S. Congress  Every 9th of August, there is an annual celebration to celebrate her in the Malindi cultural festival which has been cancelled this year due to Covid-19. Mekatilili who is also known as Mnyazi wa Menza was born in the Giriama village of Matsara wa Tsatsu in coastal Kenya during the mid-19th century. She organised her people against the British colonial rule at a time when women\u2019s power was limited within her society. At the time, the British colonial rule had threatened the sovereignty and freedom of the Giriama people with forced labour and taxation. She travelled from village to village rallying Giriama people to fight against the oppression of the British settlers. She is remembered for performing the native dance of kifudu (the Giriama funeral dance) to draw large crowds and then unleashing her powerful oratory skills to garner support and encourage her tribe to resist and swear oaths. Her leadership contributed to uprisings by the Giriama against the British in 1913 and 1914, and despite her multiple arrests and imprisonments, her campaign of resistance proved successful. The British ultimately relaxed control of the region, effectively granting the demands for which Menza and the Giriama had tirelessly fought. She is also remembered for the Mepoho\u2019s prophecy which was about the coming of strange people who had hair like sisal fibres and moved in flying vessels as well as those moving on the water and on land. She believed that the coming of these strangers would begin the erosion of the Giriama cultural traditions. That prophecy came true when the Imperial British East African Company (IBEA) started building the railway at the Kenyan coast.

Please ping me if you want a copy of the report or want to set up a call on the stock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With some of the formalities out of the way, I would like to welcome you, John, to the All Stars Conference. John, how are you?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, HESS CORPORATION: Okay, Arun. I hope you and your family are well and everybody on the call are well as well. But thank you for the opportunity to speak at this conference and very much appreciate your hard work on the company and your support of the company.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. Great. And again, thanks, again, for your important time. I know there's a lot of things between COVID and all those things that we think about. And so we do obviously appreciate you giving us some of your valuable time to meet with investors in Europe today.</p><p>So John, I have divided this topic -- or today's presentation into a series of topics to maybe help frame the discussion. And so I just thought I would maybe jump off and talk about the macro and how do you see the macro environment for oil playing out, assuming an L-, U- or V-shaped recovery.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Thanks, Arun. And we look at it really through 3 lenses: demand, supply and inventories. In terms of demand, we think we're in a V-shaped recovery. April demand in the world was down 21 million barrels a day, probably a little bit more than that out of a total global demand of 100 million barrels a day. So the most severe demand drop we've ever experienced, that U.S. and Europe shut down, 4 billion people basically were in quarantine, and the economy of the world came to a stop.</p><p>Today, demand loss has recovered to about 7 million barrels a day. I know the IEA just came out today and said it was 8 million barrels a day, but close enough. And of that 7 million barrel-a-day drop, about 5 million barrels a day is jet fuel. People still aren't flying. A million barrels a day is gasoline. People are driving, not using public transportation. And heating oil, as the industrial sector comes back, heating oil is down about -- or gas oil is down about a million barrels a day.</p><p>And while demand continues to increase or grow, it is stalling out right now. And why is it stalling out? Why has the market gone down about $5 a barrel? Part of that probably has to do with the financial markets taking a pause after the Labor Day and risk all, but part of it is also we're in a shoulder month for oil demand in September, also in October. Refinery runs go down. So the bid in the market is not quite as strong. But we see demand strengthening almost 3 million barrels a day between now and the end of the year as the winter approaches and refinery runs go up. And I think the key to next year is going to be the vaccine. Some people call it the vaccine trade, meaning when the vaccine's out, we think by talking to the different pharmaceutical companies, there's a high likelihood that the vaccine will start being distributed at the beginning of the year. We see jet fuel demand coming back, and probably, demand next year will be down on the year, maybe 2 million barrels a day. I know that's a risk, maybe that doesn't happen, but that's how we see the world going forward on demand.</p><p>In terms of supply, where demand is a V-shaped recovery, we see supply being a U-shaped recovery, meaning supply being stickier to respond to the shocks that COVID has created in the economy. In the U.S., the rig count has gone down to 254 rigs running. That compares to over 1,000 over a year ago. And as a consequence, production declines are taking effect, even though a lot of the shut-ins in the U.S. have come back, with oil being closer to $40 a barrel TI.</p><p>We see supply in the U.S. for crude and condensate going from 12.8 million barrels a day at the end of the year, to 10.8 million barrels a day today. And we see that number as being sticky until the rig count increases. If anything, we're more worried that maybe that number is going to be lower next year as long as the rig count is as low as it is.</p><p>In terms of long-cycle projects, we look at projects that are over $1 billion or more when they're authorized. That number is about 7. That's come down by a factor of 100%, probably from 15 to 7. And that long-cycle pipeline outside of Guyana is pretty much running on empty. One of the signs that the disinvestment in long cycle is going on is our own Gulf of Mexico here in the United States. 15 years ago, 8,800 blocks were leased to oil companies. Today, that number is 2,500. So there just aren't the inventory of drillable prospects out there because a lot of people have withdrawn either to the Permian or now just conserving cash. Obviously, our company is contrasted in that, in that we bought 60 blocks in the last 5 years. We have refilled our cupboard, if you will, for $120 million of some very high-return opportunities.</p><p>I think the third point on supply is OPEC+, the historic agreement that was made in April. Now their production is down about 7.7 million barrels a day. Compliance is high, probably running at about 95%. The OPEC+ countries are suffering, not just the oil producers like ourselves. Saudi itself, probably with a price drop, has lost revenue of about $100 billion this year. Their financial reserves are about $450 billion. So that's a 25% decrease in 1 year. That's not sustainable. They've got an economy and society to run. And they're feeling the pinch. Russia's feeling the pinch, oil producers are. So we think there's a reasonable chance that the compliance that has been had in the last several months will continue in the future.</p><p>So that's sort of the supply update, U-shaped recovery, demand, V-shaped recovery. All of this, when you put it together, it comes back to inventories. And due to COVID and the demand shock, global inventories built a surplus of about 1 billion barrels of oil. We think that number has gone down about 200 million barrels since April as demand has been greater than supply. While we're sort of stalling out now as demand accelerates into the end of the year, we think there will be a draw of another 250 million barrels. And basically, the balance will come in next year in 2021, probably at midyear, where we get to pre-COVID inventory levels. So with that, we do think prices will firm. They have to firm to incentivize investment, but also, they will be at a level of an equilibrium price that still will work for consumers.</p><p>So the market is in the process of recovering. But because the overhang was so severe, it's going to take some time to get to the finish line, at pre-COVID levels of inventory.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, you have a diversified kind of portfolio. So you have -- really looking for your perspective on this answer. But who do you think, from a stock market perspective, will win in the next cycle? We hope that inventories get, call it, rebalanced by the middle part of next year. But do you think that we'll be in the Catbird speed, see short-cycle shale producers, obviously, you have a large Bakken footprint, or long-cycle companies like Hess, who are investing in some of these great projects like Guyana?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: I think it's the low-cost producer that wins. We have a long-dated growing resource with decreasing breakeven costs going to $40 a barrel Brent or lower by mid-decade. And I remember being at a London energy conference a couple of years ago, and a number of the E&amp;P executives of the major oil companies were on stage in a session. And the question was asked, what's better, short cycle or long cycle. And I think the answer is not either/or, but and. It's the best rocks for the best returns. And we feel our company, with Guyana, probably the largest oil discovery in the last 20 years, world-class resource with low breakeven costs, our position in the Bakken where we've practiced lean manufacturing to keep driving our cost of development and completion down and our productivity up with plug-and-perf, we think we're in a strong position relative to our competitors to provide industry-leading cash flow growth.</p><p>One of the things we put in our investor presentation is Page 19, to show our cash flow growth over the next 3 years using third-party estimates to kind of companies as yourself, providing the estimates of our cash flow growth using your prices, consensus estimate on volumes and costs. And what you can see in that chart is our cash flow compounds out to 2022 at 10% a year, where the median of our peers actually decreases 10% a year. So then we actually raise the bar and say, how do we compare in cash flow growth versus the S&amp;P. And again, our 10% growth is competitive with big tech, with big pharma and big consumer companies. So I think our value proposition is unique. We're growing our resource, we're decreasing our cost to a breakeven of $40 Brent by mid-decade, and what that allows is our cash flow to compound, not just to 2022, but out to 2025 and beyond. And again, it's about the best rocks and the best returns in our portfolio.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, the next big topic I wanted to talk to you about is ESG. ESG topics have been at the forefront of shareholders' resolutions at energy companies' annual meetings. What's your view on the evolving sustainability preferences of shareholders? And do you see a transatlantic divide on the issue between European shareholders and U.S. holders?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Well, we believe that climate change is real and probably the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century. Our company's purpose is to be the most trusted energy partner in the world. It's fundamental to how we do business, where values drive value, and climate change is at the center of this. So we, on the one hand, want to provide the world with safe, affordable and reliable energy, but on the other hand, reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to the technology and scientific breakthroughs that are needed to respond to the global challenge of climate change.</p><p>We've been doing a sustainability report for 23 years, way before it was in vogue. So it is part of our core values. And we're honored and our teams are honored, that worked so hard on this, to be an industry leader in ESG performance as well as disclosure. Over the past 12 years, we've reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60%. We're also supporting research of the Salk Institute for nature-based solutions to grow plants, with longer roots, wider roots and suberin in them, a key element, to allow crops to store and sequester carbon where potentially billions of tons per year can be taken out of the atmosphere. So our company is doing its part.</p><p>You talk about the Atlantic divide. I certainly think some of the forward-thinking in Europe about addressing climate change is coming to the United States. It's manifest in different ways. Certainly, investors, it's a topic that we talk about in virtually every meeting, whether it's a European investor or an American investor. But I think there are 2 key points to this. One is being climate-literate, but the other is being energy-literate. And we looked to the IEA to provide the information to try to give us the idea of understanding what are the scenarios going forward to how you balance the need for the world having to have 30% more energy in 2040 as populations grow, living standards grow, mobility needs increase and yet reduce CO2 footprint by 80%, if not 100%, during the time period up to, let's say, to 2040.</p><p>And in the most rigorous scenario of sustainable development, where all the pledges of the Paris climate accord are met, oil and gas is still 47% of the mix in 2040. So I think engaging shareholders, it's important to hear what they have to say. But we in industry also have a narrative to say, the world needs more oil and gas, but the world also needs to reduce its carbon footprint. How can we have cost-effective solutions to deal with this? There's no simple answer, and it's going to -- the energy transition is going to take time. But I think Hess is uniquely positioned because we're going to have a low breakeven of $40 a barrel Brent or less. So in any scenario, I think we come out to win.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: And just maybe to add to that last question on how is Hess positioned from an ESG perspective. Can you talk about, obviously, Guyana is going to be a big part of Hess' future kind of story. How does that project kind of position, that's obviously offshore, from an ESG kind of perspective?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Absolutely. Well, just last week, we announced our Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 discoveries, bringing total discoveries on the Stabroek Block in Guyana to 18, which brings our discovered resource to greater than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent since 2015. In addition to that, we still see multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. Most of the discoveries today are at 15,000 feet vertical depth, which is shallow relative to the Gulf of Mexico, by the way. And we're starting to see -- we've had 2 penetrations in what's called the Santonian at 18,000 feet. And correlating our well logs to our seismic, we see a lot of running room, not just at 15,000 feet, the Campanian, but also at 18,000 feet of the Santonian. So we're still in early innings in Guyana, continues to get bigger and better.</p><p>Liza Phase 1, our first ship, is ramping up to its capacity of 120,000 barrels a day, where we think it will be at the end of the month. Liza Phase 2, 220,000 barrels a day. Remember, we have 30% of interest in all of these assets. That ship should be onstream by the beginning of 2022. It's currently in the yard in Singapore being outfitted with top sides.</p><p>The Payara ship, which is the third ship, which has been delayed in terms of getting a production license, in part because of COVID, in part because of a contested election in Guyana which has been resolved, we have been in constant communication as a joint venture with the new government to get the production license approved. We're optimistic that there's a few outstanding issues, mostly technical in nature, that they will be addressed so that we'll have that production license for another 220,000 barrel-a-day ship by the end of September. And the 6- to 12-month delay that Exxon -- the operators talked about, that have potential delays to that ship coming on production, that no longer will be the case and will be back on track with its original time line.</p><p>The important thing about the Redtail and Yellowtail discoveries is it really shows the greater Yellowtail area being a large resource, and it's a high-quality resource, Brent-based type of crude, lighter crude and expansive, high production rates, and we're doing the predevelopment work now to make that the fourth ship. We don't want to get ahead of Exxon or the government. We have to get the development work done. But we're relatively optimistic that, that will be the fourth ship, of about 220,000 barrels a day. Then the Uaru area nearby potentially could be the fifth ship. Turbot could be the fifth ship. And when you add those 2 together, that actually gets you to 6 ships. And we still have Hammerhead out there that's a heavier accumulation, that will be commercial one day. So there's the potential for 7 ships.</p><p>So my point in saying this, right now, we're just talking about at least 5 ships and 750,000 barrels a day capacity by 2026. So I would take the over on that based upon what I'm saying. So when people talk about when is Guyana going to plateau, we have the visibility for production growth well beyond the 750,000 barrels a day based upon the resource that's been discovered. We're just focused on investing in the lowest-cost opportunities with the highest returns, and the sequencing keeps getting optimized.</p><p>Another point there on Guyana is Liza Phase 1 has a breakeven for a 10% return at $35 Brent. And the second ship, Liza Phase 2, has a breakeven of $25 Brent. So even in a carbon-constrained world, these barrels will provide low-cost energy for many years to come and be a great return for our shareholders.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great, John. I know Guyana is going to be part of the answer to this next question, or I would assume. But one of the things that we talked about leading into the conference is the fact how energy stocks have dramatically lagged the broader market. In the U.S., it saddens me to say this, but we're now 3% of the entire market. This is a conference that includes, I think, over 60 of some of the best companies, management team stocks, cash flow stories in the whole market. So what do you think really differentiates Hess from the rest of the E&amp;P or broader energy group? And why should generalist investors do work on Hess?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: We had put out a financial outlook in our last Investor Day about 1.5 years ago and basically showed the growth of our assets on the top line at 10%, but the growth of our cash flow at 20%. And any business that has cash flow growth growing greater than the top line is a company you want to own, whether it's in the energy industry or outside the energy industry. That is our long-term strategy. It's still intact. Obviously with COVID, we took a timeout this year just to preserve our cash position so we would preserve the long-term value of our assets.</p><p>But what's unusual about Hess' portfolio, it's balanced between short cycle and long cycle. But right now, 3 of our 4 key assets, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, are cash engines. In the next 2 to 3 years, Guyana becomes a cash engine. So Hess is in a unique position, unlike shale companies, that we're able to invest in the business, grow the business, but also generate compounding cash flow and free cash flow such that, that we not only can grow our resource but also grow cash returns to our shareholders. And that balance is unusual in the business, and it's driven by the low-cost breakeven that we have.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, the next topic I wanted to talk to you about is COVID. Could you talk about some of the actions that you and the Hess management team have taken in response to COVID-19? And any lingering impacts of the virus on your operations as we sit here today?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Well, when we were faced with the challenge from COVID, we came up with 3 key strategic priorities: preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. And preserving cash, we entered the third quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. We've hedged over 80% of our crude production this year, 130 a day of WTI, $55, with put options, and 20 a day of Brent at $60 with put options. And that obviously has given us a cash cushion that has helped us quite a bit during this transition to where we become cash flow and free cash flow positive. We also reduced our CapEx, from $3 billion to $1.9 billion, and reduced our cash cost, $265 million, as well.</p><p>At the same time, we're in a long lead time business. We wanted to protect our capability. So instead of taking our Bakken rigs to 0 from 6, we took it to 1. So lean manufacturing and innovation that we have in our organization is perpetuated. The Bakken continues to perform well. We set a target of 200,000 barrels a day equivalent production for the year at the end of the year. We met it at the middle of the year. We also set a target for drilling and completion cost per well of $6 million from $7 million a year ago. We've already gone through that $6 million mark, so it's top quartile performance with our plug-and-perf completions. But we also wanted to protect our capability in exploration, which is a technologically advanced business, really capable professionals that use AI and a lot of computer tools in our seismic model. So that was an important capability to protect as well, which we have, because we believe, to get to your point of what makes us different, we still believe in exploration because it's the best way to find low-cost reserves that could create a lot of value.</p><p>And then the third priority is protecting the long-term value of our assets. I talked about Guyana in that regard. Both for us and Exxon, it's our best investment. And while we cut everything else out, that's something we're going to protect and see it through to where it becomes a free cash flow generator.</p><p>I think another key point, Arun, on our cash flow growth and growing cash flow to invest in the business but also return cash to shareholders, we are going to get to an inflection point between the second ship in Guyana coming on in 2022 and the third ship coming on in 2023, where our company starts to be free cash flow positive on a sustainable basis. It's about the durability of our cash flows, which I think are distinctive, not just in oil, but also in industry overall in the S&amp;P.</p><p>The priorities for that cash are going to be to reduce our debt first, that $1 billion we took on to bridge us of a term loan, I think it was the only 3-year term loan that was granted to oil and gas companies when COVID hit, we want to pay that debt off. But once we get beyond that and are generating free cash, the priority is to return the majority of that cash to our shareholders, first, by increasing the dividend and then by complementing that with opportunistic share repurchases. And I think that value proposition of growing our assets, but also growing our cash returns to shareholders, are going to appeal not just to oil and gas investors, but also those S&amp;P investors as well.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Got it. John, you stole my next question, but maybe -- it's such an important topic. I want to come back to it. One of the biggest questions I face as an E&amp;P analyst is, really, it's such a huge topic. The elephant in the room is this long-term investment framework. So maybe just to ask the question in maybe a different way is how do you balance investing in this great project in Guyana versus that desire to return cash to shareholders? And how do you think about that framework over a longer period of time?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Because Guyana is a world-class resource with these low breakevens that I talked about, Guyana itself becomes a cash engine, probably 2022, 2023, depending upon oil price. So all 4 key assets of Hess, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico, Malaysia and Guyana, are going to be growing. So we're going to have enough cash flow to invest in the business, and that will be between $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion, depending upon where the Bakken is and where we are in the time lines of Guyana versus the $1.9 billion we're investing now. And still, we will have free cash flow on top of that to return cash to shareholders.</p><p>So it's because of the portfolio of high quality, low cost of supply investments that we have that we're able to invest in the business but also compound cash flow growth, allowing us to return the majority of our free cash flow as cash returns to our shareholders while we're still growing the business. The challenge with shale companies, quite frankly, is they're very capital-intensive, and it takes years before they become free cash flow positive.</p><p>And if they're going to run their companies, which they should to be free cash flow positive, their top line growth has to be impeded. Because we have superior investment opportunities with higher returns and lower costs, we're able to grow the resource, grow our production and at the same time, grow our free cash flow. And it's, again, the portfolio of the best rocks for the best returns, we have that in our company. And that's why we stayed in the long-cycle business because we thought that just short-cycle shale would eventually become a mature business and have capital pressures on it that we're able to overcome because we have a superior investment portfolio between short cycle and long cycle.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Yes. John, one of the questions I get from investors is you and Exxon have had to make some adjustments to capital just given COVID, a lower oil price environment, this -- call it this -- and Phase 3 just because of the election cycle in Guyana. But the question is, has the Exxon-Hess consortium, are you still adjusting your long-term capital in any ways that would impact perhaps the timing, let's say, you get government approval for Phase 3, but are you still investing appropriately in Guyana? Are you going to bring a fifth rig next year? That's the question I get from investors.</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Sure. No. Neil Chapman, I think, on Exxon's last quarterly call, has said this, and we certainly say it as well. Whatever capital Guyana needs it's going to get because it's such a high return and enables you to become a cash engine and a free cash flow generator. So you're going to cut everything else off before you start that.</p><p>Having said that, when COVID hit, for COVID reasons, and also election reasons, first, we were worried about Payara being delayed. Now I'm pretty confident that it will stay on its original track. Remember, we've already constructed with SBM the hull for the third ship, which is Payara. But the one area that actually was delayed some was the timing for the fourth and fifth ship coming on. Originally, we said that we were going to have 5 -- at least 5 ships on, producing 750,000 barrels a day by 2025. Now that number is 2026. But actually, the timeout has worked to our advantage, where both we have found higher-quality resource in the greater Yellowtail area. So it would actually be a lower cost of development than we originally anticipated at Hammerhead, and it will also be a larger development at 220,000 barrels a day versus 140 a day at Hammerhead.</p><p>So we actually are creating value in that interim. So while we may be delayed, we're actually going to have a higher NBV and a higher cash return because of the change in ships. I think the other point is we have found, to get to your point on exploration in the fifth rig, because we are going -- we currently have 4 rigs in theater, basically 2 working on development drilling for the 2 ships and 2 working on exploration and appraisal. Once we have Payara, we're going to have to take one of those ships and have development drilling for Payara. So we think, to get after the exploration and appraisal work we have, we will need to bring the fifth ship in theater. So plans are underway to move forward on that.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Yes. The last question kind of on this capital allocation investment kind of question set is can you talk -- maybe delve a little bit deeper on how the company is managing this low-price environment and some of the outspend until you get ship 2 on phase. And just if you could also address the sanctity of the dividend. I know you preserved the dividend in the tip of this downcycle, this vicious downcycle, but I wanted to get your thoughts on both of those 2 questions.</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Well, it gets to that first strategic priority of preserving cash. Any time there's been a financial crisis or oil crisis, you have to have a strong cash position. You never run out of cash. I know it's a truism, but in times of stress, it's especially profound. And we entered the third quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. We got the 3-year term loan, $1 billion as well. We have the hedges. We also had a VLCC strategy, where other people were shutting in shale production in the United States, because we've invested in the midstream. And we also have a great commercial team. We chartered 3 VLCCs, so we didn't have to shut-in production and we could move oil out at Brent-based pricing. The first VLCC, we've actually already sold in at a Brent premium price into China. That ship should be offloaded before the end of September.</p><p>The other 2 ships we should sell during the fourth quarter. So it's all about preserving cash. To your point, yes, we have an outspend next year. People say, John, don't call it an outspend. It's an investment program in a high-return project in Guyana. That's the case, but it's still an outspend.</p><p>So how do we think about that? It's keeping the capital tight. We reduced our capital from $3 billion going into this year to $1.9 billion, a lot of that for Guyana, cutting back on the Bakken as well. Prices are here. You can assume that will be the number for next year in the range. We'll announce that in January. So keeping the first strings tight until that second ship to come on is important.</p><p>In addition to that, we will be a price-taker at the end of the year to put more hedging on. We will use puts. As you know, options have time value and as well as volatility value. So right now, putting options on would be expensive. We'll wait until the end of the year, where they are less expensive, whatever the prices it is. If the oil market firms a little better, we're putting better insurance on. But we're not doing it to call price. We're doing it to protect the downside, so we can get to that second ship. So all of these are steps to keep our financial strength.</p><p>And the one other thing, Arun, we still have some noncore assets. I can't be specific about which ones that we are advanced in considering selling. That will fortify our cash position more. So we're taking all the steps to keep the cash position strong. So even if oil prices are low next year, even if we have an economic downturn next year, we still are going to be strong as a company going into 2022 when that second ship in Guyana comes on at 60,000 barrels a day with a breakeven of $25 Brent.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, you touched upon this earlier, but I did want to maybe elaborate, the next time it's going to be Guyana. Let's start with Liza Phase 1. You got that on production early. And like any large industrial project in the early phases, you're just going to go through some commissioning and some teething issues that you troubleshoot. I know that you have a built one. And then you'll have that same kind of design on a go-forward basis. But can you give us a little bit of an update on how production, how the reservoir has been performing? And any thoughts on getting to that peak plateau rate, which I think The Street is modeling in the 120 kbd range on a gross basis and you're 30% of that?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Yes. We've had some short-term start-up problems, debottlenecking problems on the ship. It has nothing to do with the reservoir. It has to do with the gas compression and gas handling system on the ship. Some of it has to do with metallurgy. Some of it has to do with COVID to get the experts in to fix it. SBM is obviously overall responsible, but Exxon is the project manager on this. Efforts are underway to get it fixed. It's taken a little bit longer for the reasons that I mentioned, getting materials in place as well as people in place. It's taken a little bit longer. We thought it would get to the 120 a-day nameplate in August. Now it looks like it will be the end of September. But it's a short-term issue. Exxon is all over it. It's going to get fixed to get to that peak rate of 120 a day. So we're getting very close to that finish line.</p><p>I think what's important to note, this is a short-term mechanical problem that has to do with the top sides, operating system on the ship. It has nothing to do with the quality of the reservoir. The wells have been performing at or above capacity, very high flow rates. When people talk about EURs, estimated ultimate recovery, in shale wells, they talk about 1 million barrels. If you're really lucky, maybe 2 million barrels, right? But normally, it's a million barrels.</p><p>When you're talking about EURs in Liza Phase 1, it's 50 million to 60 million barrels. So it's just a whole another quantum of productivity and high-quality performance in terms of production rates as well as recovery rates. The reservoir, if anything, is better than we anticipated. And we're going to be doing a drill stem test both on Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 to really finalize and evaluate the quality of that reservoir for the fourth ship. So it's a -- top side, it's a mechanical issue, it will be fixed, but the reservoir itself is some of the best-performing reservoirs in the world.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Yes. The other question I get from investors is just Liza Phase 2. We obviously have COVID. If you think about the shipyards and that, can you provide us maybe an updated time line on your current expectations around timing for Phase 2?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Yes. Phase 2, while there were some slowdowns in the yard because of COVID in Singapore, the Keppel Shipyard, Exxon had been doing a masterful job of running ahead of schedule. So there was some cushion in the system, and thank God there was. So Exxon is still very, very confident about being able to bring that ship on with production and all the subsea and drilling campaigns that have to be done over 2 seasons. We're still looking at early 2022. So the original target is still the target for first production of that 220,000 barrels a day.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, the market has recently digested some good drill bit news from the Exxon-Hess consortium. You just talked about Redtail, success there as well as at the deeper interval at Yellowtail-2. The key incoming question from the buy side is whether these new 2 discoveries that you guys have announced, does this change your view of the peak production capacity of Guyana or just extend that plateau rate forever -- the length of, call it, that plateau rate?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: First and foremost, it extends and grows the peak production capacity of Guyana. That's why I said, when we say it's at least 5 ships and at least 750,000 barrels a day by 2026, we can see well past that with a much higher number. Obviously, we have more appraisal work to do to define what the fifth ship is, potentially what the sixth ship is, potentially what the seventh ship is. So first and foremost, it extends that and grows the peak.</p><p>In addition to that, however, it also will extend the plateau because we're finding a lot more oil, both at 15,000 feet and hopefully, it's 18,000 feet. So Guyana will be generating cash flow for our shareholders for well beyond this decade.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Got you. Next question regarding Guyana is just kind of Phase 3 of the project. The country just went through, call it, an extended election cycle. There was a change of regime. And I think during that election process, the whole government, call it, suspended approval of projects such as Payara, but where do we stand? Can you talk about any discussions with the new government? And any thoughts on when we could kind of move forward with, call it, formal approval and FID of Phase 3 of these projects? Also, I was wondering if you can maybe highlight what your thoughts are on timing. I know that you and Exxon indicated the potential 6-plus-month delay just given COVID and other factors, but maybe give us an update to the market this morning or this afternoon...</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: No, the newly sitting government, President Ali, Vice President Jagdeo, have been very constructive in working with the joint venture. We're in constant communication about the approval of the production license for Payara. We're optimistic that we will get the approval of the production license before the end of the month. So I would say it's a very constructive, collaborative relationship. I think they realize that the more our joint venture can invest in the oil and gas industry in their country, the more the revenues for share prosperity of all Guyanese citizens will increase, and it's our mutual interest to move forward with the investment. So I would say all the talks are very constructive and also encouraging to get that production license approved before the end of the month.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: End of the month. Great. Great to hear that. One of the positive surprises, John, regarding -- going back to Phase 1, is the consortium, I think, was able to deliver that project at more than a 20% discount or under budget, 21% underbudget is really unheard of or very rare in the business to have that wide a gap relative to budget. I don't know, can you give us maybe some anecdotal comments on how Phase 2 is trending and maybe some potential upside risks regarding recovery rates, capital efficiency, but regarding Guyana?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Yes. Well, the first ship, as you said, versus when we started, Exxon has done a masterful job reducing the cost part of it from operating efficiency, where I think to drill and complete a well, it was over $80 million, now it's under $60 million. That's savings on every well to drill and complete. So they've done a great job on drilling. But also design one, build many, there are learnings from the first ship that are going to the second ship and then ultimately, the third ship, a gas link being one of them right away, where we see, I would say, reductions in capital costs anticipated for Liza Phase 2 as well, just like we had it for Liza Phase 1.</p><p>We're also at the low point of the cost cycle offshore, obviously, with very little activity going on globally. So that benefits us in the FPSO that benefits us on the top side, that benefits us at subsea and drilling. So across the board, we're seeing cost reduction on Liza Phase 2, almost similar to what we saw on Liza Phase 1. And Exxon is a world-class project manager, and they continue to deliver these projects below the budgeted amount.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great. John, I think we have time for 2 more questions, but I didn't want to ask you about the exploration side. And I think we could probably devote an entire Zoom conference call on the exciting exploration potential on Stabroek and beyond that because you do have a lot of leasehold within Guyana and Suriname. But can you talk firstly about the remaining exploration potential just on the Stabroek Block today?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Yes. As I've said before, we're still in the early innings. We've had 18 discoveries as we've correlated those well logs to seismic. We're actually seeing more opportunities. Usually, you look at the seismic for a direct hydrocarbon indicator. We're starting to see there's so many sand channels where the direct hydrocarbon indicator is maybe dimmer, which would indicate that maybe there is an oil in the sand, and we're finding that there is oil in the sand. So we're seeing a lot more running room at 15,000 feet for Campanian. Early days, we only have 2 penetrations in the Santonian at 18,000 feet. So that's why we want to bring the fifth rig in theater to get after those exploration opportunities.</p><p>Obviously, right now, we have to do so much to get the development drilling underway. We're building up a pretty good inventory that will drill next year on exploration opportunities. I would say, by the end of the year, there's a prospect outboard of Liza called Hassa. That will be one that we drill. We're currently drilling the on the Kaieteur Block that's directly north of Stabroek, our first well, the Tanager well. And also, as you know, Hess has a pretty healthy inventory of exploration opportunities and acreage in Suriname on Block 42 that's contiguous to the Apache discoveries and also Block 59. We have 1/3 interest in both of those.</p><p>And also, let's not forget, the Gulf of Mexico still has a lot of prospectivity, and they're either tieback opportunities, Miocene opportunities or Cretaceous opportunities that we'll be drilling over the next several years as cash flow permits. So the Hess inventory of upside to exploration is still very significant.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Okay. John, we're going to end with 2 questions from the investors who are participating in the conference that have been sent to me. And so I'm just going to read this off to you. John, are you able to expand on your general strategy on hedging? And are the actions you took in 2020 indicative of a longer-term strategy or response to COVID-19? And any thoughts about your hedging strategy in '21 and beyond?</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Right. Oil is a volatile commodity. It goes up, it goes down. And when it goes down, it really impedes our company and all oil companies' cash flow to fund through the cycle. The oil that is exposed for Hess is our U.S. production because the good news in the tax royalty regime, we do really well when prices are up, and you get killed when prices are down. We want to take that downside risk off the table. It's about risk management. So you can assume, as I said before, as we get to the end of the year, we will put more put options on for downside protection for the company in terms of risk management of the price risk for the company on the oil side. And you can assume in future years, we will continue to hedge year-by-year on a similar basis.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: Great, John. And my last question -- or pardon me, an investor question is on the surprising question that I'm sure you get a lot in the U.S., is what are John's views on the U.S. election and potential risk assuming Vice President Biden is elected as President, comma -- or question mark. And secondly, what are his thoughts if Trump is reelected? So again, John, what are your thoughts, if Biden is elected, the impact to Hess Energy, or under a Trump second term is the question from...</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: As the saying goes, it's always dangerous to talk about politics at the dinner table. It's probably dangerous to talk about it at an investor conference. With that -- and with that as a proviso, look, Vice President Biden obviously has climate change as a major item on his agenda, just like President Obama had. Specifically, what does that mean in policy, I don't think has been clarified with specifics yet, certainly as a clean energy plan to have a $2 trillion program to make the electricity 100% renewable by 2035 in the United States. That's very ambitious, given that renewable energy currently is 15% of electricity generation. So the specifics on that, we need to learn more about, how can we afford it, how can we make sure that energy costs stay controlled and reasonable for working class families. But that's one of the issues that's out there that we need to come to closure on, to have a plus-benefit analysis to have the right landing point.</p><p>In addition to that, in the debates, Vice President Biden said, there will be no new fracking. There's no such thing as no new fracking. There isn't old fracking. It's fracking. And he's walked back on that because that would have a major impact. And it would be a bad idea for the U.S. as it recovers because oil and gas are key to jobs, 12 million jobs direct and indirect, key to low energy costs for consumers and working class families and key to our national security as we're energy-independent. So that comment has been walked back to where, well, maybe we'll have no new fracking on federal lands. What we need to realize is federal lands for oil are 23% of oil supply, oil production in the country; 2/3 offshore, basically the Gulf of Mexico; 1/3 onshore.</p><p>So again, I think we're in the campaign mode. Once the president is elected, if it is Biden, I think, industry and government are going to have to work together to have some cost-benefit analysis and find a middle ground on what makes sense for energy, but also what makes sense for climate. It goes back to what I said before. You have to have climate literacy and energy literacy for sustainable development of our economy as well as the world economy. And right now, I think Biden's policies are not that specific or clear outside of the renewable and issue there for electric generation.</p><p>Obviously, President Trump has been very supportive of the oil and gas industry, streamlining regulations. So we still protect the environment, but also encouraging investment, both in the exploration and production space as well as infrastructure. So obviously, if he is reelected, I think the policies will continue to be very supportive of the business.</p><p>In either case, the United States is going to need oil and gas investment. And I think to being successful in the volatile commodity price world that we're in, the key is having the right rocks for the right returns. We're in that position, and we're going to keep our cash position and balance sheet strong, deleverage and get to that long-term strategy deliverable, which is compounding cash flow and free cash flow, that after we pay off some of our debt, we're in a position to grow our resource and grow free cash flow to return the majority of that free cash flow to our shareholders through a dividend and then complement that with share repurchases.</p><p>ARUN JAYARAM: John, on behalf of the JPMorgan team, we certainly appreciate you participating in today's fireside chat. We covered a lot of great ground today. And again, thanks for your support for the conference, and again, thanks.</p><p>JOHN B. HESS: Arun, thanks for including us and the honor of presenting and also your support and interest in the company. It's been a pleasure.

Maar in Europa is de speeltijd voorbij, daar helpt Margrethe Vestager mee voor te zorgen. De Europese commissaris voor Mededinging legde al Google en andere digitale reuzen over de knie. Zij horen de economie te helpen, niet te verknechten. \"Voor zakenmensen zal het klinken als een paradox: om economisch potentieel te ontketenen, heb je regulering nodig.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weinig Europese commissarissen zijn zo bezongen geweest als Margrethe Vestager. De Deense domineedochter geldt als ongedwongen en doortastend tegelijk. Haalde ze als Deens minister soms haar breinaalden boven tijdens ministerraden, dan pakt ze als Europees commissaris voor Mededinging met evenveel gemak giganten als Apple, Google en Facebook aan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wanneer we Margrethe Vestager ontmoeten, heeft Mark Zuckerberg net zijn historische kruisverhoor in het Amerikaanse Congres achter de rug. De Facebook-baas moest er uitleggen hoe de persoonsgegevens op zijn servers in de verkeerde handen terecht konden komen. Miljoenen Facebook-gebruikers speelden ongewild mee in manipulatie van verkiezingen en andere duistere spelletjes. Als een miljardenbedrijf als Facebook zijn data niet kan beschermen, wie dan wel?</p><p>Voor Europa kon het Facebook-schandaal op geen beter moment komen. Deze maand treden de nieuwe Europese privacyregels in werking, de GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Waar de Verenigde Staten achteroplopen, kan de Europese Unie zich als een voorloper profileren, voor een keer. Nog niet lang geleden was digitale privacy iets voor oude mensen, maar het tij keert snel en de EU is bij de les. \"We zijn vooruitgelopen op de curve\", zegt Vestager niet zonder voldoening.</p><p>Met digitale rechten voor de consument doet Europa wat het moet doen. Zelfregulering was geen optie meer voor de machtige Big Tech-bedrijven. \"Je mag niet afhankelijk zijn van goede wil\", zegt Vestager, die in haar thuisland Denemarken tot de sociaal liberalen behoort. \"We hebben de regulering nodig, niet door het Facebook-schandaal, maar wegens de complete machteloosheid van mensen bij pagina's en pagina's gebruiksvoorwaarden. Uiteraard vinken ze dan het blokje 'I accept' aan.\"</p><p>Afgezien van privacy, zien sommigen geen probleem. Bedrijven als Facebook en Google domineren de markt, maar ze bieden ook gratis diensten tegen goede kwaliteit. Zolang de consument er wel bij vaart, hoeft de overheid niet in te grijpen, luidt het.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER. \"Als een bedrijf geen concurrenten heeft, zal het dan blijven innoveren voor het goed van de consument? En dat is niet het enige probleem. In veel landen is Google zowat de enige toegangspoort tot het internet geworden. Als een klein, innovatief bedrijf niet te vinden is in de zoekresultaten, hoe kan het dan de aandacht trekken van investeerders? De markt kan alleen de consument dienen bij voldoende concurrentie. Want dan is er druk om te innoveren, om het beste te bieden tegen competitieve prijzen.\"</p><p>Dus de concurrentie komt het eerst, daarna zien we wel of de consument aan zijn trekken komt.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"De consument moet toch een keuze hebben? Als een dominant bedrijf hem die keuze ontzegt, kan je dat toch geen concurrentie noemen? Neem de zaak Google Shopping (de prijsvergelijkingsdienst van Google, door Vestager beboet met 2,4 miljard euro wegens misbruik van marktdominantie, nvdr). Google zet zijn prijsvergelijker op de eerste pagina, recht voor uw ogen. Concurrerende prijsvergelijkingsdiensten verschijnen gemiddeld pas op pagina vier van de zoekresultaten. Dan is er geen sprake van keuze. Niemand gaat naar pagina vier.\"</p><p>Als zoekmachine heeft Google zijn dominantie niet gestolen, maar opgebouwd met knowhow. Mag het daarvan de vruchten niet plukken?</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Ik zou u volledig gelijk geven als Google 25 procent van de zoekmarkt had. Maar Google heeft 95 procent van de markt.\"</p><p>Maar is dat de fout van Google? Het bedrijf kan toch moeilijk zelf de concurrentie organiseren.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Neen, marktdominantie is toegelaten. Een bedrijf mag succes boeken in Europa. Maar je mag die dominantie niet misbruiken om concurrenten op afstand te houden. Marktdominantie brengt verantwoordelijkheid met zich. We controleren nu of Google die verantwoordelijkheid opneemt en concurrerende prijsvergelijkers dezelfde kansen geeft als Google Shopping.\"</p><p>Voert u geen strijd van het verleden? Misschien wordt Google morgen al omvergeduwd door een start-up met een betere technologie, blockchain bijvoorbeeld.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Ja, als die start-up tenminste aan bod mag komen. Als hij niet eens de kans krijgt zijn innovatie te tonen aan de markt, hoe kan hij dan bedrijven omverduwen? Het wordt moeilijk concurreren als uitvinders in hun spreekwoordelijke garage moeten blijven. De digitalisering van de economie maakt gelijke kansen des te belangrijker. Landbouw, transport, gezondheidszorg: alles digitaliseert. Ook verkopen almaar meer kmo's via een onlineplatform (zoals Amazon, nvdr). Het is de feitelijke voordeur van hun winkel geworden. Veel bedrijven zien die voordeur plots gesloten worden, zonder uitleg, zodat klanten hen niet meer kunnen vinden.\"</p><p>Het platform is de markt geworden en ook daar moet het spel eerlijk gespeeld worden.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Precies. Over enkele weken leggen we daartoe maatregelen op tafel. Je moet altijd oppassen voor overregulering, zeker bij fenomenen die nog in volle ontwikkeling zijn. Maar zonder regels regeert de wet van de jungle. En de jungle geeft geen tien bedrijven met elk 10 procent van de markt, de jungle geeft monopolies.\"</p><p>Je kunt monopolies ook van onderuit te lijf gaan, zeggen economen. Zorg gewoon dat consumenten hun data kunnen verkopen, aan meerdere bedrijven en meerdere keren in de tijd. Dan hoeven nieuwe marktspelers minder op te boksen tegen de immense databestanden van Big Tech. Wat vindt u daarvan?</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Consumenten verkopen hun data nu al, voor niks. Of tenminste, ze krijgen zoekresultaten in ruil, of ze mogen tweeten. In feite geven ze Big Tech een gratis licentie voor het gebruik van hun data. Door de GDPR zal dat veranderen. Je krijgt rechten over jouw data, wat het mogelijk maakt die data te verzilveren. In enkele lidstaten duiken nu al initiatieven op, digitale assistenten die je helpen met het beheer van je privacy en de verkoop van je data.\"</p><p>Met een beetje geluk ontstaat een compleet nieuwe economische sector.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Het potentieel van data is enorm. We zullen ziektes uit de wereld kunnen helpen waarvoor vroeger geen behandeling was, we zullen vlot verkeer krijgen waar voordien files stonden, en veel meer. Maar dat zal pas lukken als we eerst de duistere kant van data aanpakken, als bijvoorbeeld verkiezingen niet langer gemanipuleerd worden op basis van ontfutselde persoonsgegevens. Als iedereen te bang wordt ook maar iets over zichzelf prijs te geven wegens de akelige gevolgen, dan zal het potentieel van data nooit naar boven komen. Voor zakenmensen zal het klinken als een paradox: om economisch potentieel te ontketenen, heb je regulering nodig.\"</p><p>Is Big Tech niet te ingewikkeld geworden voor adequate regulering? Amazon is een webwinkel, een logistiek netwerk, een cloudbedrijf en nog veel meer. De ene activiteit is een hefboom onder de andere. De concurrenten van Amazon zijn vaak tegelijk zijn klanten. Kunt u dat nog behappen?</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Bedrijven met elkaar versterkende activiteiten zijn niks nieuws. De digitale tijden veranderen ook niet de motieven achter machtsmisbruik, zoals hebzucht en machtshonger. We hebben daarom geen nieuwe regels nodig maar modern gereedschap, in de vorm van hedendaagse IT. En daar investeren we ook in. In het dossier-Google moesten mijn mensen zich door 5,2 terabyte data werken. Zonder de gepast soft- en hardware lukt dat niet. Het doet bedrijven zelfs teruggrijpen naar de ouderwetse methodes. Afspraken over prijzen en de verdeling van de markt worden weer gemaakt op het golfterrein en niet langer in de cloud, waar wij ze nu kunnen vinden.\"</p><p>Marktdominantie is niet alleen een zaak van de digitale wereld. Volgens onderzoek is er ook een groeiend probleem in de traditionele sectoren, althans in de Verenigde Staten. Gaat het in Europa dezelfde kant op?</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Dat is inderdaad ons aanvoelen. Om dat echt te besluiten, hebben we nog onvoldoende data. We hebben al data sinds de financi\u00eble crisis van 2008, en die wijzen op een toenemende concentratie in de Europese IT- en telecomsector. In dezelfde periode steeg ook het aandeel van de bedrijfswinsten in het bruto binnenlands product van 8 naar 12 procent. Dat lijkt niet veel, maar het is wel een stijging van 50 procent in een korte periode. Dat suggereert een toenemende marktmacht van bedrijven, die zo een groter deel van de koek voor zich kunnen houden, in plaats van de koek te delen met de consumenten.\"</p><p>U moet de concurrentie bewaken. Is het niet even belangrijk de concurrentie te stimuleren, door het inperken van lobbying bijvoorbeeld? Kleine bedrijven kunnen geen lobbyisten betalen.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Wij zijn er juist om de belangen van kleine bedrijven te bewaken. Concurrentie zorgt ervoor dat de winsten niet terechtkomen bij een select kransje bedrijven. Bij de overname van Monsanto door Bayer zorgen wij ervoor dat de boer nog altijd kan kiezen uit dezelfde hoeveelheid leveranciers van zaaigoed en onkruidverdelgers, zodat er concurrentie blijft bestaan.\"</p><p>Is lobbying een probleem in de Europese wandelgangen? Je hoort allerlei verhalen, zoals gekonkelfoes bij beslissingen over hormoonverstoorders of emissienormen voor auto's.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Er gaat almaar meer geld naar lobbying. Bedrijven moeten dus wel denken dat het werkt. Er is een reden waarom sommigen investeren in lobbying. Wij maken de zaken zo transparant mogelijk. Ik doe mijn best om geen lobbyisten te ontmoeten. Als mijn collega's een ontmoeting hebben met een lobbyist, komt dat in een register, zodat dat zichtbaar wordt.\"</p><p>De EU heeft het niet gemakkelijk. Toen de kloof tussen noord en zuid wat minder diep leek, kwam er een nieuwe kloof, tussen oost en west. Wordt het niet stilaan hopeloos?</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Het wordt alleen hopeloos als je stopt met proberen. Niets is ooit verworven. Het kan altijd weer verkeerd gaan. De Europese democratie zal alleen werken als we ze gebruiken voor het goed van de mensen. Europa moet concrete problemen oplossen, het liefst van Europese of zelfs wereldwijde schaal. Wij, Denen, hebben niet de minste illusie dat we op eigen houtje de Europese grenzen kunnen beveiligen, of de opwarming van de aarde te lijf kunnen gaan. We moeten alleen oppassen dat Europa niet in een zeepbel terechtkomt. Neem die discussies over - hoe heet het ook al weer - 'interinstitutionele relaties'. Natuurlijk vragen mensen dan of we niks beters te doen hebben. Want in dat geval zijn we enkel met de interne keuken bezig.\"</p><p>De hervorming van de euro is geen interne keuken, helaas. Daar blijft maar hommeles over bestaan.</p><p>VESTAGER. \"Conflict brengt verandering. Weinig belangrijke dingen ontstaan uit harmonie. Je weet hoe het gaat met grote politieke beslissingen: eerst zijn er heftige discussies, gevolgd door pauzes en daarna nieuwe onderhandelingen, tot de tijd eindelijk is rijp voor een compromis. In Denemarken zijn we zo blij met de Grote Beltbrug, tussen de eilanden Funen en Seeland. Het heeft ons 100 jaar gekost om te beslissen. Nu vraagt iedereen zich af waarom we de brug niet eerder hebben gebouwd.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRNDMG-TR18180081intern</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRENDS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7G-K2C1-JCSJ-11CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Roularta Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trends</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41059\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 3, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Tijdschrift</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>DUTCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>NEDERLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Publication Location: Belgium</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0009S73</classCode><className>Software Services + Applications</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>STX000444</classCode><className>Data Mining</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware that such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last week, U.S. social media - indeed, worldwide social media - remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p> Last week, our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of Big Tech are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p> Then, on Monday, reports confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \"FAANG\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (Disclosure: I own only Amazon stock, and The Washington Post is owned by Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p> Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p> No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p> I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.\"</p><p> But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There's little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings - perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p> What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p> Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p> Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p>  Hugh Hewitt, a Post contributing columnist, hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of \"The Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-b9a71356e480d0a55f32aed2d670951feeac72e5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E56B3479FE0 NWBKOH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MDM1-DXVP-V1B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. social media \u2014 indeed, worldwide social media \u2014 remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p> Our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of Big Tech are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p> Then, in early June, reports confirmed the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \"FAANG\" \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p><p> Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues or even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p> No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p> I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.\"</p><p> But count me skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were not widely aired, much less debated. There's little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings \u2014 perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p> What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p> Barr knows the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p> Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-e645306125e640dc1ff9c24be8a18c931988c255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896EFBA38A978 NWBKTX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB7-D4G1-DXVP-V360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Longview News-Journal, Longview, TX<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware that such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last week, U.S. social media - indeed, worldwide social media - remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p> Last week, our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of Big Tech are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p> Then, on Monday, reports confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \"FAANG\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (Disclosure: I own only Amazon stock, and The Washington Post is owned by Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p> Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p> No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p> I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.\"</p><p> But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There's little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings - perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p> What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p> Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p> Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p>  Hugh Hewitt, a Post contributing columnist, hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of \"The Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-f8d369374f6e94d28616d6e98a4f493ed742bf0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E56A9B43178 NWBKOH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9T-0MT1-JBCN-412X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I'm Daisy McAndrew.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC, ANCHOR, CHEDDAR: And I'm Tim Stenovec. To say that this HPE Discover is like no other is an understatement. The state of the world, amid a global pandemic, has changed everything, and it's hit very close to home for HPE.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, it certainly has, Tim, because HPE's CEO, Antonio Neri, himself recently shared that he tested positive for COVID-19. But I am so pleased to say that Antonio is able to join us today to talk about all that's ahead for this HPE Discover Virtual Experience. Antonio, before we talk business, I know the entire community, including myself, really wants to know, how are you feeling?</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Well, first of all, hi, Daisy, and thanks for having me today. I feel much better. I'm now into the second week, and I have to say I feel pretty much back to normal. Obviously, the first few days were a little bit more difficult where you're tired, you're lightheaded. But I feel much better, ready to go for the week ahead, which is a very exciting week as a part of our HPE Discover, which this year is a virtual experience, and you will see we are raising the bar once again.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Certainly raising the bar. And so many changes. Antonio, we've got your keynote coming right up in just a moment. I'm so glad you're well enough to bring that to attendees. What can we expect to hear from you?</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, as always, we want to come across as the best partner for our customers to work. We listen to them. We understand their needs. And we're going to demonstrate the progress we have made in the last year. As you recall, last year, I said that we're going to make everything we do in this company available as a service by 2022. So I'm going to provide an insight into that. And with a series of announcements, which are very exciting, around the cloud services and our software portfolio. We'll also talk about the -- a new age of insight, is a new area we are entering. And I have asked my dear friend, John Chambers, to talk about this, because even in the pandemic, we see that the opportunities continue to grow tremendously. And we believe we need to move from collecting data to providing insight to the business. And John and I have a unique point of view. I'm sure the audience will enjoy hearing from John how we think about the future.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: I'm sure you're right, Antonio. We look forward to hearing more from you in your keynote.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, thank you for covering us this week, and I hope to speak to you throughout the event. Take care.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Antonio, you, too. All right, Tim. Well, as they say, let's get on with the show.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Thanks, Daisy. It is so great to hear from Antonio. And by going virtual, HPE has managed to make Discover into a more global, yet more intimate experience for people around the world. It's going to be a great couple of days.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Tim, you're so right. 150 sessions coming right to you, the attendee, live and on demand. You consume the content HPE will provide at your own pace. You choose your own adventure, if you like. Now all of the things you've come to expect and look forward to from past Discover events are still available. The sessions, the demos, training, the HP leaders, industry experts and customers, all available to you in this new virtual experience. So HPE has even managed to bring a little bit of Vegas to this event. What do I mean? Well, you know Vegas never shuts down and neither does this, the HPE Discover Virtual event. This Discover is always on with live programming to accommodate any time zone in the world with a wealth of on-demand content available in your own time anytime.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: A special thank you today to customers and partners. Just by registering, you've helped in the fight against COVID-19. Each registration for Discover Virtual Experience translated into a $10 donation on behalf of HPE to 1 of the 10 charities in the fight against COVID as the company lives up to its purpose of advancing the way people live and work.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: That's such great stuff, Tim. And thank you, of course. Now as an IT leader on the front lines during the COVID pandemic, and as we make our way forward in the digital transformation that's become mission-critical for businesses today, HPE is here to help. In 2020, the success of businesses around the globe won't be judged on earnings or stock prices. This year will be all about how enterprises stepped up in society or in support of their employees as COVID-19 swept the globe and life became remote.</p><p>Now, of course, the tech industry was front and center in a movement known as Tech for Good. And I'm really thrilled to be joined now by tech industry leader, Sally Eaves, to talk about the role the industry needs to play in the rebuilding of work and the rebuilding of societies in a post COVID-19 world. Sally, a very warm welcome. I want to start off by asking you, does the tech industry have a responsibility to -- I know it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but make the world a better place? And if it does, how?</p><p>SALLY EAVES, OFFICIAL MEMBER, FORBES TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL: Firstly, wholeheartedly, yes. As you know, Tech for Good is a massive passion of mine, and it's not something just to be spoken about. It's something that we have to do. It must be actualized. And I think COVID-19 is a tipping point moment for Tech for Good. We've seen how we can come together. We've seen how we must come together, and tech could be a massive force, not just for digital transformation for business and for business continuity to keep business going, but much more than that. It can make a pivotal difference for society as well. So we've seen this tipping point moment. I think the high-performance computing consortium is one great example of that. The tech industry coming together, 11 different tech companies, an ethos, a collaboration above competition and working together hand-in-hand with a variety of different other organizations, especially education, especially academia, closing the gaps.</p><p>Now we've seen innovation, for example, around vaccines and pharmaceuticals would normally have taken, say, 15 to 18 months. We've seen huge strides in 7 weeks. That's unprecedented. But we've also seen, over this period of time, digital equity gaps. We have to close them. But, again, we've seen tech companies stepping up to the plate in 24 hours coming out to schools, setting up WiFi systems in car parks, doing all sorts of things at very short notice and being very pragmatic at times as well, but it's been about that doing. So I think now Tech for Good is becoming embedded in everything that we do. And I'm -- looking ahead from COVID-19, for me, the positive legacy of this is that this is being embedded into all business models.</p><p>I've always said this, it's not an add-on. It's not an afterthought. Tech for Good should be at the heart of all we're doing as good businesses. So I think in the future, people won't be looking on return on investment. I'd like to think of it as return on social investment. And I have a real [inner] clarion call to really follow that example. And I think it's, yes, to say, tipping point moment for Tech for Good right here right now.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: It certainty is what you call a tipping point moment. So I think all of us realize that this is a big moment and a big moment of change. And I want to talk to you now about trust in tech and what's changing in that area. Is this an opportunity to help rebuild some of the erosion of trust that exists towards technology today, Sally?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Absolutely. I think we have to grab hold of this moment. We're starting to change the narrative. Again, something else I talk about a lot, in the past, some of the headlines around tech have used certain language, and it's been scary, words like elimination or destruction in terms of AI. And we're seeing now actually tech in partnership can make such a difference. This is -- this human tech partnership is the way forward. We've shown concrete examples of how we can step in and make a difference. So we need to focus on that and really expand it. So it is a tipping point moment in that sense.</p><p>One of the aspects, I think, is communication. There's some recent research looking at trust, and it was saying that if people feel adequately informed, that's the biggest driver to changing your view about trust. And again, we can bake trust in. Blockchain tech, for example, is one way of embedding trust actually within the technology we use. And I think all the discussions there's been around track and trace systems, for example, to help over the COVID-19 experience, if something like that was used, that's a way to embed tech -- trust in with the tech itself but it has to be coupled with education, with awareness, making sure all voices are at the table. So it's not just tech driving change or government, for example, it's about every voice being heard, so academia, civil society, the general public, and having that opportunity for cross sharing, and feel part of that conversation, feel listened to and to contribute before the outcomes rather than just kind of being a [reciprocant] of an outcome.</p><p>So yes, again, trust, identity, massive key themes at the moment. And again, I think we're seeing some real progress to embedding that in and building that trust back.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And, Sally, it's not just the pandemic that we're all thinking about or experiencing at the moment. So I want to talk to you about the unrest surrounding social injustice and the worldwide call for change on that. Where does the tech industry come into play in that area?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Absolutely. A massively important point. I think we've seen, well, a, real leadership in coming forward and making a stand. That's absolutely critical. We need to have leaders at all the big tech organizations really stepping up to the plate here, and we've seen some powerful examples of that already. There's some practical things we can be involved in. I think AI is probably the most critical example of them all in terms of technology areas. We've seen that there are issues with bias in AI. We've seen the lack of diversity in the talent pipeline who is building AI. And that's not just about gender or about race. It's about whole diversity of experience of who is involved in building the tech of the future. So we need to do more work in that area.</p><p>I think there's lots we can do to attract more people into the tech industry to fill the talent gaps, to change the conversation about what tech is. I think that embedding of purpose in all we do is absolutely critical. So yes, it's leadership. It's showing up. It's calling out when things are being done wrong and real practical examples of making a difference. And I think AI is probably the biggest talking point that worries people and where we've seen concrete examples of where it has gone wrong. So where it has, let's not hide away from that. Let's be transparent, massively important, and learn from those examples where mistakes have been made because then we can get better. We can learn, we can build and we can make improvement. So, again, it's this dialogue, people coming together, more open sharing around these development and investing in education.</p><p>As you know, a massive -- with the foundation I have, a massive proponent of STEAM learning. So that creativity, diversity of experience, art skills alongside tech confidence as well and enabling more people to benefit from this, that's the way we start building into the future, and we start reducing the risk of inherent bias whether intentional or otherwise.</p><p>So yes, tech and education absolutely hand-in-hand and investing to impact, massively important.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, Sally, I think you've really laid it out for us just now that so much work has been done, so much has been achieved, but there is still so much more to do and so much for us to discuss here. So, Sally, for the moment, thank you so much for being with me today. Sally is going to be back with me later in the day to wrap up all that's happened at the Discover Virtual Experience. Tim?</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Over the next 20 minutes, Daisy and I will be joined by 3 more special guests to help set the stage for what's to come on day 1 of the HPE Discover Virtual Experience.</p><p>Today kicks off with a keynote from HPE CEO, Antonio Neri. But before we hear from Antonio, we are going to spend next little bit with HPE's new CTO and Head of Software, Kumar Sreekanti; and CMO, Jim Jackson; we'll also get perspective from IDC's Crawford Del Prete.</p><p>We're going to kick it off with Kumar Sreekanti. Kumar, welcome.</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI, CTO &amp; HEAD OF SOFTWARE, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Thank you, Tim. Nice to be here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, let's start with your new role at HPE, Kumar. You are now Chief Technology Officer as well as being the Head of Software. Congratulations on your roles. Of course, you come to HPE via the acquisition of your company BlueData. What can you tell us about your new dual role?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes, indeed. I've come to -- my entry into HPE is through the BlueData acquisition. I was the Co-Founder and CEO of BlueData. And in my new role, dual CTO as well as Head of Software, my CTO role is the classic technical advising to Antonio and my leadership team as well as working with our M&amp;A and investment strategies and focus on organic and inorganic innovations and combining the software technologies that we have into the new era.</p><p>As far as the software role is concerned, as you know, HPE's strategy is edge to the cloud platform company. Software is a very key component of this technology. So we have made a decision to bring all the key software technologies under one leadership so that we can focus on not only setting the strategy but executing and aligning the execution with the innovation.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So I want to drill into that a little bit more. I'm curious why HPE is entering the software business, specifically, though, in areas like containers and Kubernetes.</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes. So what's happening in the modern application development is containers and cloud-native technologies is taking hold. And the customers are looking to innovate and modernize their applications. As you know, HPE, we announced the container platform back fall of last year, and this -- what this container, it's a very unique container platform, which takes advantage of open source technologies as well as the technologies that HPE has acquired through BlueData and MapR. And this brings all the both organic and inorganic innovation and build a very, very robust container platform for enterprises to modernize their applications.</p><p>On the top of that, we have recently acquired an open source CNCF technologies company called Scytale. And this -- what it clearly indicates is we are committed to having an open source technologies and software technologies to help our customers to modernize their applications. And then as you can see, as our strategy has indicated, that our edge-to-cloud platform has 2 key components in it. One is a software that allows us to build elastic, scalable, automated, secure and optimized infrastructure, at the same time building a runtime software that allows us to build workload optimized solutions. These 2 technologies are key for our GreenLake. There will be some exciting announcements. Stay tuned from Antonio in the keynote.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, speaking of Antonio, people who are watching right now who have seen previous keynotes know that he's talked about data being the new currency, and also unlocking value from all of an enterprise's data is the ultimate goal. So what do you believe must be addressed to make that a reality?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes. As I mentioned, data has a gravity. And what people don't realize is you can't shift the data overnight. And in addition, as it's been told, the data is the new oil, right? There is a lot of opportunity for customers to figure out how to get value out of this data. This is the reason why we have announced recently ML ops platform. It's a machine learning ops platform. And we are very focused on -- our platform is very focused on AI, ML applications around containerization. So we expect us to continue our journey in this direction and help the customers to realize the value at the lowest workload optimized cost for the customers.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, you and your team certainly spend a lot of time with clients. I would imagine that now most of it is virtual, previously would have been in person. But I'm curious, what are they telling you about their transformation journey?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: We have spent a lot of time talking to the customers, and the customers are looking at modernizing their applications to make -- take advantage of all the new technologies and stay competitive. And another very interesting -- as we all know, as we just said, because of pandemic, the digitization -- or digital transformation has put additional requirement on these enterprises to transform them very quickly.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Kumar Sreekanti, HPE's Chief Technology Officer and Head of Software at HPE. It's great to have you with us today. Congratulations again on your new position. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Thank you, Tim.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Okay. Let's get some analysis on everything that Kumar just had to say as well as expectations for this HPE Discover event. I want to bring Daisy back in. And we're thrilled to be joined by the President of IDC, Crawford Del Prete. Crawford, so great to see you today.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Look, you and I are hundreds of miles away, Daisy, thousands of miles away, and we have people tuning in from all over the world. This year's HPE Discover event is quite different from years past. What do you make of this virtual experience?</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE, CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER AND EVP OF WORLDWIDE RESEARCH PRODUCTS, IDC UK LTD.: Yes. Thanks for having me, Tim and Daisy. It's fascinating, right? We've seen events change before our very eyes over the last 15 weeks here. And what I make of this is that in an interesting way, I think that HPE will be expanding their reach dramatically. This event lowers the barriers to making it to one of the faraway places that Discover typically happens, whether that be in Las Vegas or whether that be in Germany or whether that be in the U.K. or around the world. And I think this virtual event is another example of how companies are really focusing on creating an environment where people can get the information that they need. They can do it virtually. They can download the information that supports the videos that they're going to see. And HPE can amplify their message.</p><p>And actually, in some ways, people can start to understand who else is there. You can understand the partners, the ecosystem partners that are at the event and really understand how HPE is planning to continue on their journey but also participate in this new normal going forward and help lend a hand in transitioning to this new normal. So, look, I think that this event is yet another evolution and a really positive evolution.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So, Crawford, what are you looking to hear from Antonio Neri's keynote today?</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE: Well, when I look at Antonio's keynote, you have to remember, HPE has been on a journey, and that journey is to support customers where they are in their hybrid cloud evolution. And at IDC, we believe, and our research says, that the majority of applications are still outside of the cloud, outside of a cloud service provider. So what that means is the customers are looking for cloud service experiences within their data center, and they're also looking for that ability to move across clouds and be able to have services that support these clouds within their physical environments. So I think you're going to continue to see an evolution of that message. You're going to see more services that HPE is developing to support that long-term hybrid environment.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, the world that we're in right now, just close to halfway through 2020, is completely different than the one that we entered back in January of this year. How has the landscape changed for HPE since COVID-19 in the marketplace or just in its business approach?</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE: Well, for HPE, it's -- and all technology companies, it's really quite amazing, right? You have all these sales reps that are now inside salespeople. They have to meet with their customers virtually. And then also, we're seeing that, particularly, companies like HPE and many tech companies have really stepped up with a level of empathy around trying to understand how can customers be successful in this new normal. Now, of course, if you're a customer in the retail business or if you're a customer in the tourism business, that's been a massive pivot, and it's been devastating for a lot of those sectors. And HPE, I think, is really focused on trying to help those companies visualize their journey going forward as we start to get back to work in different geographies around the world.</p><p>But beyond those segments, what we -- what you start to see is that how can HPE do 2 things? How can they help companies be productive while information workers are working from home? And that means secure access to applications. That means being able to get the information that you need and make the decision at the edge of the network. So HPE being able to offer edge-based solutions is very, very important in that environment.</p><p>Additionally, we've seen that HPE, I think, is going to take a stance here and really focus on how do they develop services that will enable companies to get back to work productively. So that means being able to really help companies think through and have services to think through what does a return to site plan look like, how do I have services that are going to help my employees feel safe, feel productive, feel like they can operate virtually if that's required. And I think there's an entire service catalog and service portfolio that you'll likely see going forward from HPE and from companies like HPE in order to enable the journey from work from home to sort of a hybrid work-from-home environment to ultimately a new normal, which is, I think, the journey we're on over the next 12 months.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Crawford, I'm longing to ask you about the subject matter that Sally Eaves and myself were talking about just a few minutes ago. We were discussing the responsibility that tech industry bears in society today and how that's changed. And when it comes to helping find a cure for this pandemic and providing technology to communities in need, there's so much to do. And, Crawford, are you seeing tech companies step up?</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE: Yes, Daisy, I am. I'm seeing -- obviously, to varying degrees. And whether that means a company providing the compute power to try to research ways -- in HPE's case, that could mean providing supercomputing power to companies that are trying to crack the code around COVID-19. Whether that means the tools to help with things like contact tracing, whether that means having edge devices as well as geospatial devices to help understand who were you with, if you were around somebody who's been infected, I think that tech companies are trying to step up and are making a commitment to try and get through this ordeal in as rapid a way as possible.</p><p>But let me just say that when you think about tech companies in general, we believe at IDC that what this ordeal represents is almost like hitting the fast forward button by 5 years in a number of different areas. In the future of health care, in the future of work, in the future of collaboration, in the future of education. And you kind of get the point. And I think that tech companies need to continue to innovate.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: It's fascinating what you were saying, Crawford, there about the speed in which everybody is having to either change the way they think or to literally innovate and invent things. And with that speed, there must come dangers.</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE: Yes. Well, of course. And, of course, some of those dangers, the tech industry is well schooled in kind of fast fail and experimentation, perpetual beta, trying these things and then, of course, quickly course correcting. And I think that what you're putting your finger on basically is a very, very important trend, which is that we can experiment around the way people work and the way people collaborate. But then there are areas where experimentation is a lot more risky when it gets into health care, when it gets into the caring of individuals who are sick. And in those areas, obviously, we have government controls and we have to be very, very careful about those things. But I think that the experimentation nature of technology is something that, in the end, will be of value here because it will allow us to try many different things in order to reinvent the new normal, which is kind of where we're headed.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Crawford Del Prete, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>CRAWFORD DEL PRETE: Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Now for HPE's Chief Marketing Officer, Jim Jackson, who's joining me today to make sure you, the viewer, gets everything possible out of the HPE Discover Virtual Experience. And, of course, this is new territory for all of us, whether you're a presenter, a customer, a partner, an influencer, an analyst or whether this is your 10th HPE Discover or perhaps your very first. Welcome, Jim, to the program.</p><p>JIM JACKSON, CMO, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Thanks, Daisy. Excited to be here. It's going to be a great day.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, Jim, here we are in our new virtual setting, but tell us about the journey to create this event.</p><p>JIM JACKSON: Yes. We had to pretty much rethink everything about this amazing event: content, audience acquisition, demos. We had to really rethink it all. And for us, it really all started with the vision, and that vision was to bring the Discover experience to our customers, to our partners and to our team members. So that kind of guided us. The other thing is this opened the aperture for us to really reach a global -- a true worldwide audience. So we're really, really excited about what we're going to do over the next few days and coming weeks.</p><p>Daisy, you've been to our Discover in-person events. We have an amazing large demo hall, and what that enables us to do is showcase our technology. We had to rethink all of that for a virtual delivery, and I'm so proud of the teams because we have over 61 demos. And if you think about it over the first couple of days of the event, we're going to showcase that over 1,700 times live. Meaning if you have a question, we will have experts on the line who can address your questions. We have another 100-or-so sessions as well that people can attend.</p><p>And then, finally, for us, the party doesn't stop after the first week. We're going to continue this through multiple waves in the follow-on weeks. So we are really excited and fired up to get our story out.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Now, Jim, I am hearing quite a lot of whispers about some really pretty exciting names we're going to hear from.</p><p>JIM JACKSON: Daisy, we have some amazing speakers that are going to be part of the Discover Virtual Experience. We have Lewis Hamilton, six-time Formula 1 Champion; Simone Biles, Olympic champion, 25 medals; Steve Kerr from the Golden State Warriors; we have John Chambers, former CEO of Cisco; Soledad O'Brien; Toto Wolff; Christian Horner; Daniel Levy; Rick Welts; Susie Wolff. We have just an amazing set of speakers. Great stories, but also reinforcing the messages that we want to get across. It's going to be really exciting to hear from all of them.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, I can't wait to hear from them. But, of course, we are just about to hear from Antonio himself. Can you give me any hints about what we might get to hear from him in just a moment?</p><p>JIM JACKSON: Antonio is going to demonstrate massive progress toward delivering against our edge-to-cloud platform as a service strategy that we rolled out last year. This is really unique in the industry, and it's what's needed to help customers accelerate to digital transformation. There's really 3 sections to Antonio's keynote. The first is how we're here to help with customers' recovery. We have got amazing stories that you're going to hear from multiple different customers, and they're going to really bring that to life. We also have the Cerner CIO that will be joining Antonio.</p><p>Then we also have John Chambers. I talked about that earlier. John is going to join Antonio, and they're going to talk about how great companies really support their customers and their partners and their team members during a time of crisis, but also how they come out on the other side, and what are some things that you should be doing to really be more prepared for the future. And then finally, we have some significant industry reveals that Antonio is going to announce. These are really, really significant. They're in the cloud space. So we're going to be announcing new cloud services that span from edge to cloud and that really are targeted at the 70% of applications that we feel will not go to the public cloud. So huge, huge announcements.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And such a huge amount of work and such an ambitious project. It's going to be so exciting over the next couple of days. Well, it's Jim Jackson, HPE's Chief Marketing Officer. So good to have you with us just now.</p><p>And that brings us to the main event. We'll be hearing again from Antonio himself in just a moment. But before we go, Tim and I want to let you know that we will be here with you throughout the day. We'll be right back straight after Antonio's keynote, and we'll count you down to Keith White's spotlight. Then later today, I'll wrap up all that took place on day 1 at the Discover Virtual Experience with analysis and a look ahead at what to expect from day 2. But right now, let's listen to the keynote from Antonio Neri.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Welcome, everyone, to HPE Discover Virtual Experience. This is a truly global event. Over the next 24 hours, we are streaming Discover to you wherever you are around the world, translating content into 10 different languages, and we have hundreds of HPE experts available to speak with you anytime.</p><p>I know you have no shortage of virtual events to attend, and I'm honored you have chosen to spend time with me and my HPE team members. So thank you.</p><p>You may have noticed, I'm coming to you from my home in California. We slightly adjusted the virtual experience plans after I tested positive for COVID-19 last week. The good news is I'm feeling much better and have learned to set up my home production studio in my living room. But joking aside, this is a very serious virus, and I feel fortunate that I'm well enough to join you at HPE Discover.</p><p>Today, we will focus on 3 topics. First, we will discuss your immediate needs for recovery post-COVID, things like connectivity, capacity, cash flow and business continuity. We are here to listen and here to help. Second, we will discuss how we are entering what I call a new age of insight that is driven by the next phase of digital transformation. I have asked John Chambers, former Chairman and CEO of Cisco and my dear friend, to join me for this discussion. Third, we will discuss HPE's expanded portfolio of new cloud services and software that brings to you a cloud experience for all your apps and data no matter where they live. This accelerates the commitment I made last year to deliver everything to you as a service by 2022, transforming HPE into the edge-to-cloud platform as a service company.</p><p>Before we get started, I wanted to share the last few weeks has been very hard for me to process. I have felt many emotions, anger, disbelief, sadness, grief and frustration, with the systemic operation and racism that still exist in our society. HPE as a global company has a responsibility to help shape a world that is equal for all people. I am committed to taking a stand, to speaking up, to advocate within and outside the HPE for equality.</p><p>We have a belief at HPE, and it is to solve humanity with humanity. Everyone deserves to live free of oppression and racism. I challenge you to join me to use this moment to take a stand to speak up on inclusion and to advocate for equity. We have to do better as a society. And together, we can make a difference and be a force for good. So let's get started.</p><p>We are living in unprecedented times. The COVID-19 pandemic created many new challenges not just for your technology, but also for our society as a whole. At HPE, our purpose is to advance the way people live and work. Solving challenges like these is why HPE exists. And through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of HPE's response. We consider it our responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather this storm together.</p><p>The future everyone talked about before the pandemic is now here ahead of schedule. Three years ago, we predicted the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. Today, that's no longer a prediction. It is a reality. And we know this edge-centric, cloud-enabled world will require the right technology, expertise and financial flexibility to help you accelerate your transformation. These ingredients made us unique before this crisis. They were also essential to you when you needed our help the most. And these same ingredients are what will enable us to continue to serve as your strategic partner going forward.</p><p>During the pandemic, we also responded with very important initiatives to address your key needs. For example, we designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to help customers and partners with financial hardships. This program helped May Seed, the leading agricultural company in Turkey, when financial uncertainty threatened to derail a critical IT initiative. They turned to HPE for financing help by participating in our 2020 payment relief program. Rather than jeopardizing the production and delivery of crucial crop seed to more than 40 countries, May Seed was able to eliminate disruptions and keep their supply chain on track while deferring more than 90% of the cost until next year.</p><p>Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual health care clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. Let me give you an awesome example. In the state of Arkansas, right here in the United States, Bentonville Schools had 1 business day to move 18,000 students and 1,200 teachers to virtual learning. Days after the shutdown, a photo emerged of students huddled outside the school on a cold, rainy day. Their families did not have Internet access. Our local Aruba team sprang into action, created turnkey WiFi solutions with drive-up connectivity for students, teachers, families and community members in the school parking lot.</p><p>Our high-performance computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions speed up drug discovery with complex modeling simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities. At The University of Alabama in Huntsville, HPE cleared the way to provide Dr. Jerome Baudry with full free access to our Cray Sentinel supercomputer to fight COVID-19. We also joined forces with the U.S. government and other high-tech companies to form the White House High-Performance Computing Consortium, giving COVID-19 researchers access to HPC resources. It is clear, HPE's edge-to-cloud strategy delivered as a service is the right solution now and in the future.</p><p>You asked us for immediate help in your hospitals, schools, stores, employees, homes and other unexpected places. You needed equipment, capacity and connectivity as well as security, services and support across your edge locations and data centers. You wanted flexible financing to get it deployed immediately. Around the globe, thousands of HPE Pointnext Services members provided the critical support to large or small companies alike to run their operations smoothly without interruption.</p><p>And HPE will not be who we are without the dedication of our partners. We have hundreds of thousands of partners who build, deliver and help manage solutions in over 80 countries. Together, we're all working side-by-side to build incredible solutions that solve your most immediate and unexpected challenges. I am proud to say that these were just some of our unique assets that we brought together to help you respond and recover. I know many of you have your own unique situations and needs like this. Rest assured, we are here to help, and we will make them happen for you.</p><p>Here's a video showing some stories of what our HPE team members and our customers achieved together.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>While technology accelerated these victories, our team members and partners made them happen. Their daily acts of innovation and the power of their \"yes, we can\" spirit inspire me every day. It makes me even more proud to be part of HPE.</p><p>To demonstrate our commitment, you may have noticed when you registered for Discover, we committed to donating $10 for every single customer and partner who join us today. So on behalf of HPE, in your name, we have donated to 10 amazing nonprofit organizations, all making a real impact on the life of people around the globe.</p><p>Like all of you, we are still learning about driving our business and serving customers through this pandemic. On the frontline of our response here at HPE was Liz Joyce, our Chief Information Security Officer, with representative from every team across the company. I'm happy to have Liz with us today to share her insights. Welcome, Liz, and thanks for joining us, and thanks to you and the entire team.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: During this unprecedented time, what were some of the most unexpected challenges that the team found?</p><p>ELIZABETH JOYCE, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Yes. Thanks, Antonio. I think we, like everybody, learned a lot during this event. The first thing that jumps to mind for me is the fact of the truly global nature of this event. We, as a company, at HPE, have a good history with business continuity and resilience, but even we weren't fully prepared for a global pandemic. And so with the breadth and the scale of everything going on, we had to very quickly react and adapt and put in place a lot of global structures in order to support the massive amount of activity that was going on. So that was everything from 24/7 war rooms, to all of the structures in order to have local action, with strategic and global decision-making, and all of that supported by a huge amount of communication. So we're managing globally but at this local level.</p><p>I think the other really key thing is around the fact that a crisis, in my mind, is normally a time-bound, finite event. And it's usually measured in minutes and hours and days and weeks. We have been in this for months, and so this is not a short-term crisis. This is a long-term sustained event. And so as we do things as part of the crisis and managing it, we need to think of them in terms of they may become foundational to what is going to be our new normal moving forward. And so we have to be very thoughtful in that, make sure that we have sustainable and manageable processes. I think those have been the 2 biggest challenges to date.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: We are, what, 4 months into it. Obviously, we have a lot of learnings that you just went through it. But as we go forward, how we are thinking differently? And what advice actually you can share with our customers?</p><p>ELIZABETH JOYCE: Yes. I think a couple of things that we're definitely doing differently is we are thinking global but acting local. So the word you've been using at Discover, glocal. It really is about managing the entire process globally. You want to keep everybody safe no matter where they are. You want to provide consistent services and products to our customers no matter where they are. So you need that constant global structure. But to do that, you also need to have local detailed knowledge. So where are people? What are the conditions? You have to be able to merge those 2 things in order to ensure that we can still get on with our job.</p><p>I think the new normal, we're all trying to figure out the new normal. We're trying to understand how we can work remotely and still get the same or even better outcomes. But then when we really do need to go to sites, how can we do that safely and securely and keep people protected?</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: So, I mean, obviously, we are planning our return to work, and your team was at the beginning of the crisis through the crisis management team now under kind of returning back to whatever the new normal is. I think about automation because, also, we're going to be way more distributed. I think about security, obviously. I think about safety. So what is top of mind for you and the team right now?</p><p>ELIZABETH JOYCE: Yes. Well, all of those things, safety, first and foremost, for everyone. And obviously, we're collaborating with all of the teams to deliver on that to keep people physically safe. From a online, cyber perspective, we obviously -- it's all again about data and intelligence and also speed of response. So having all of the information, being able to gather that, being able to truly understand, again, at a global scale, whether people are at home or whether they're on the network, just have that visibility and ensure that we can protect them.</p><p>That automation is really key because that speed of response, when you're talking about a global situation, it's just really important. So understanding your tooling and your configurations, focus on automation. And the insights you can get from the data and applying those in a very automated, real-time, consistent way, those are all critical and fundamental to us ensuring that we can protect everyone going forward.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, thank you, Liz, for joining me today. But most importantly, thanks to you and the team for all the hard work, dedication, has been long hours managing the crisis, getting us through the crisis, obviously, preparing us to get back to work. It doesn't go unnoticed. And what you guys are doing is just amazing to me. But also, we're going to learn quite a bit, as you said, and we're going to share this with our customers. So anyway, thanks for joining me today, and first and foremost, be safe.</p><p>ELIZABETH JOYCE: Thanks, Antonio. Be safe.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Based on our own learnings and from helping customers, today, we released a new report, the new IT playbook for disruptive times with strategies and best practices for accelerating successfully into the next chapter.</p><p>Our customers have told us they need help getting back to work in the new normal, whatever the new normal may look like. So to help get our customers and communities back to work safely, we launched 5 new solutions through HP Pointnext Services to address critical needs such as social distance tracking and tracing, touchless entry and fever detection.</p><p>Another inspiring example was our partnership with Cerner health care. When the U.K.'s National Health Service, or NHS, rapidly required increased hospital capacity, Cerner health care transformed the ExCel London convention center into a 100-acre temporary hospital in days. Please join me in thanking all the Cerner employees and the medical professionals who helped to make this happen.</p><p>I had the chance to catch up with the CIO of Cerner, Bill Graff, and asked him to share Cerner's amazing story with us today. Hi, Bill, thank you for sharing your experience and insights with us today. Cerner is on the front lines every day with response to COVID-19. However, why don't you share a little more to our audience about who Cerner is and what do you do?</p><p>BILL GRAFF, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, CERNER CORPORATION: Thank you, Antonio. Cerner is a 40-plus year-old company that's been focused really the last 40 years on digitizing health care. Really, over the last few years, we believe that the health care digitization has happened, and so now we're not only focusing on continuing that effort, but also taking our big data platforms and driving insights through our population health platform as well as our electronic medical record platforms to better provide insights and continue to improve health and care for all of our clients, primarily in the provider space.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Thank you, Bill. Tell us more about your learnings from the NHS Nightingale experience, which was amazing.</p><p>BILL GRAFF: The Nightingale experience was -- they're based in London, and we were asked by our clients there to help set up a field hospital, allowing for a surge of COVID-19 cases. So they asked for Cerner's assistance in setting up a 4,000-bed, basically field hospital in a large auditorium space. So in working with our partners, HPE, I called Antonio and asked for him to help us expedite some additional hardware capacity, which HPE did very generously, got that to us in time. As well as our consulting organization and technology organizations helped the actual client become prepared in new processes and workflows to be able to support the surge that was happening in London at the time.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Yes. I think it's an amazing and inspiring story. I'm glad we could help. And thank you for your partnership, and thank you for joining me here today, Bill.</p><p>BILL GRAFF: Thank you, Antonio.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Our conversation went on to cover many more topics, including Cerner's outlook for the future. So please visit our (inaudible) website to watch more.</p><p>As we recover, I believe it is important to focus on and discuss the future. Mary Meeker recently published a report title Our New World 2020, which explores the impact of COVID-19. She made a striking observation in describing the state of the world at the height of the pandemic. She said, \"We are awash in data but lacking connectivity and insight.\" Even in the early days of the pandemic, officials around the globe shared spreadsheets to track utilization and hospital capacity. We have enormous amount of data we couldn't analyze, and what we did analyze often created conflicting answers.</p><p>Despite decades of investment in technology, there remained hundreds of dark, unconnected pools of data. Researchers and providers were overwhelmed by the volume of the data, unable to create insight and action from oceans of information. We cannot repeat this failure. I believe we are nearing the end of the information era, which focused on generating and collecting massive amounts of data, data that could not be brought together to create timely insights and actions to change our future.</p><p>The next decade must be about insights and discoveries that are shared and elevate the greater well-being of every human being on this planet. Today, we are entering the age of insight.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: The age of insight required new principles and priorities for digital transformation. The focus is to build an edge-to-cloud platform that connects, protects, analyzes and acts on all your data and brings agility to your apps to unlock your enterprise's full potential. These capabilities will be mission critical to you and unique to your strategy, industry and customers. Your edge-to-cloud platform will allow data and services to move without constraint. This is possible when you build up on open-source, cloud-native technologies, optimized for a highly distributed infrastructure model based on proven trust and identity. Our future can unlock you and your data into someone else's walled garden.</p><p>To make the next wave of digital transformation a reality, our first priority is to address the workloads that must be close to the data, whether the edge or in data centers. Almost 10 years after public cloud emerged, more than 70% of apps and data are still outside the public cloud. They still lack agility due to data gravity latency and app entanglement. As a result, you have 2 divergent operating models: one in the cloud and one on-premises, while paying higher cost to maintain them both. In the next wave of digital transformation, I believe we will shift from a cloud-first mandate to a cloud-everywhere mandate. And to bring the next wave of digital transformation into focus, I had a chance to sit down with my good friend, John Chambers, Founder and CEO of JC2 Ventures and Former Chairman and CEO of Cisco.</p><p>Thank you for joining us today, John. I appreciate you making the time to speak with me and also to speak to the audience. We have an incredible cast attending this webcast. The first question I have for you, John, you have managed a powerhouse through 6 different market crises. Just amazing to think about 6 market crises. What advice you have for today's leaders as they navigate through this uncertain future?</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, FOUNDER AND CEO, JC2 VENTURES: Well, it is my sixth financial crisis; my fifth health care crisis, although, obviously, the most severe; my third supply chain crisis. So I've seen the movie a number of times. And the playbook, both on what you do and learning from my mistakes in the past as well, is remarkably repeatable. First thing is, as a leader, you don't hide. You need to be very transparent, out in front. Secondly, you want to be realistic, how much was introduced by the crisis you're dealing with, and how much was the company also needed to change because you must address both at the same time.</p><p>Then you basically say, what are the platforms or key focus area. I like odd numbers, 5 to 7 platforms that are going to lead you through the crisis and prepare you for the outcome. You anticipate what are the elements here in terms of what you will look like 12 to 18 months, paint that picture for your employees, for your customers, your shareholders, your partners. And then you regularly communicate back on how you're moving toward those objectives. The platforms you deal with are usually around how do you control expenses, free cash flow, your employees, your customers. You also want to say, what are my new big bets we're going to make through it? And a crisis always lasts longer than we anticipate and will usually be deeper. So you try to make your changes one time, prepare yourself for the future.</p><p>Then what's exciting is once you do that, then you take your company. And remember, my parents are both doctors. They taught me to deal with the world the way it is, not the way I wish it was. We all wish we could avoid this. But once you're here, what are you going to look like 2 and 3 and 5 years out? It's a chance to do a new IPO. It's how do you really position the company and your employees to not only survive this but to lead in the next generation of great companies.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: In many ways, you have reinvented yourself every time there is a crisis, learned from the past, make a decision quicker, obviously, but also position yourself for the massive opportunity ahead, because where there is a crisis, there is an opportunity.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: So part of it is reinventing yourself, and I absolutely agree with that. But part of it is the aspects of the playbook you can run again and again. Reinventing yourself is the hardest thing for a CEO to do. It's how do you have the courage to say, let's learn from my strengths, but also, what am I going to have to do differently in this next era. You've got to disrupt or you get disrupted. You have to have the courage to initiate that vision and strategy and say how we're going to change. And this is where culture and communication become so important.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: We are going through a crisis right now, right? And I believe the world is going to change forever. We're going to live in a massive distributive world. And I believe many organization are totally unprepared. They never thought they will send 100% of their people working from home. I think -- and I talked about the power of delivering outcome from the data. And so when you think about the next wave of digital transformation, what do you think are the key principles and priorities customers should have in mind? Because you and I talked early on, it's not about the digital transformation, it's becoming digitally native in everything we do.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: So, Antonio, when I really think about what's about to happen, first, 40% to 50% of the Fortune 500 will not exist in a decade. It's going to be a brutal change. And these terrible events we're now seeing will actually accelerate that. Probably 60% of the startups won't exist in a decade. And a number of them won't exist in 2 to 3 years. So it's a period of time whether you either disrupt or you get disrupted. Your ability to compete not against competitors, but compete against the new market transitions, the new business models, outcome-focused, enabled by the Internet of everything, big data and being able to analyze that and then do the compute, do the storage, do the access to that big data, the applications, the security at the edge.</p><p>And it gives a company a chance to really transform themselves into a direction. One of the positives out of these challenging events will be companies will move much faster to a digital world. HPE, I think, is positioned yourself for how do you do that. How do you do it with innovation, how do you do it as the cloud moves to the edge? How do you use this digital, if you will, architecture to disrupt.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: And now, we talk about the edge, right? We try just to explore a little bit about the distributor world where the edge is where we live and work. And you and I have both the same vision. We believe that's the big opportunity going forward. And we both invested in a company called Pensando. Maybe you want to share with the audience a little bit about how we're thinking about that future together.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, what was fascinating, Antonio, the first time you and I talked, I used acquisitions at Cisco, where we did 180 of them to really move into new market areas. Then I began to learn how do you do strategic partnerships. With start-ups, they're often able to attract the talent at a faster pace, and their investors are willing to invest 10 years out, which is hard to do it as a public company. So the ability to partner with start-ups in a way that a large innovative company can partner with a start-up that's very innovative and change your market is there. With Pensando, this is a team that has built $8 billion products, usually 50% to 70% market share. And it's a company that combines basically the ability to do storage and security and compute at the edge. And I think we both envision how that's going to transform, where probably 75% of the data and applications will occur at the edge.</p><p>It's a team that loves you all and you all love them. And this is where when you partner, you've got to have a culture that moves rapidly together. We've been together since you literally were a key investor in our last round, but our teams have melded so well together. I can't tell the difference between your team and my team at that end.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: So in light of everything going on in the world today, this, I think, is a nice pivot, right? How do you build the culture for transformation? Because we talk about reinventing yourself, transformation never ends, right, it's a journey here. How you do that over and over and over again?</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: Well, I think it first starts with -- you've got to have a strong culture yourself. One of the many reasons that I love HPE is Lew Platt. When I first came here to Silicon Valley...</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: That's the time I joined HPE when Lew was the CEO.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: Oh, did you? Amazing man, but your culture was amazingly strong. I called him up, and I said, I'm in charge of a company called Cisco, not the food company. I've only got 400 employees. We're doing something called the Internet, and I don't understand the valley. He asked me to come over and spend time with him. And I met with him every quarter for the next 3 years. He taught me about Silicon Valley. By that time, we were on a roll on our way to becoming the most valuable company ever in history. I turned to Lew and said, \"What can I do to pay you back?\" And he said, \"Do it for the next generation.\" So I have, over the last 3 decades. But the cool thing is now to work together to change the marketplace. Back to the cultural part of that, you can't have a great company without a very strong culture. You may like it or you may not. I love the HPE culture. HPE, what you all have done, it starts with the CEO. You've got to walk the talk, you've got to have the courage. You can't say change is good for you all, not for me. You lead by example, and you have to reinvent yourself every 3 to 5 years. Also the culture of are you a good person. People love working here. I love the culture that you've built. But you have the courage to say, we've got a change. You outline a strategy and vision on how you change and then you pull your team with you. It's an honor to be a wingman and part of that, and we'll do our best not to let you down.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, thank you, John, and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts today with us. For me, it's an honor to work with an iconic person like you. I never stop learning from leaders like you because in the end, Silicon Valley has done amazing things. But ultimately, we as the leaders, have a responsibility to do it in a sustainable way. And you have been a voice in the market for decades. And so for us to partner together on something that we believe is going to change the world, it's just a unique opportunity that we take it very seriously. And thank you for being with me today.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS: Yes. It's my honor. You really think about leadership, the role of the CEO is simply strategy and vision, develop, recruit, retain the leadership team to implement the strategy and vision, the communications and the culture, and I'm betting on HPE for the future.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Thank you, John.</p><p>Next, I wanted to introduce you to an innovative company at the forefront of building an edge cloud platform and who is on the front lines of ushering an age of insight. If there is an automaker that's nearly synonymous with driver safety, it is Volvo. If there is a technology that's pushing the auto industry in the vast unknown, it is autonomous driving. So what it does look like when Volvo enters the race to build the safest, self-driving car? The answer is Zenuity, a start-up launched by Volvo to dream up the car of the future and turn it intra reality.</p><p>Zenuity's CEO, Dennis Nobelius, has been on both sides of the driver safety conversation. He guided the creation of the model 90 for Volvo before leading its self-driving car start-up company, Zenuity. I had the opportunity to catch up with Dennis earlier.</p><p>Let's see what he had to say.</p><p>Thank you, Dennis, for joining me today. It's an honor and a privilege to have you as a part of our event to share your story. I hope everything is going well in Gothenburg. I note that the summer is always an important part of the season that I know you and the rest of your competitors are looking forward to it. But why we don't jump into it? Zenuity is a new company, and it has a great motto, which is make it real. So how you put in action the make it real in your day-to-day activities?</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS, CEO, ZENUITY AB: Thank you, Antonio, and thank you for having me here. Yes. So we are a young company, but we also have a very strong heritage on the safety side. But when it comes to make it real, it's all about bringing automotive software out on the streets, in the hands of customers and we're all about -- we are super focused on the unsupervised driving, so making autonomous driving real. And we also believe that this technology will change the way we live in our society and actually the way we build our society. So it's a technology that holds a lot of potential in saving lives. And when it comes to making it real, you need a few things, you need a lead customer, and we have Volvo Cars, both as owners and as a lead customer. And they are so committed in making this technology come to life. And then of course, you need talented people and a very strong ecosystem. And here is also where we are teaming up with HPE and think that this partnership will prove a lot when it comes to making it real.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: So I'm sure there is a lot of people out there wondering how autonomous vehicles really work. Maybe you want to share with the audience kind of the life cycle of an autonomous vehicle. How that works?</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS: Sure. So right now, we are in the development phase. What that means is that we equip cars with kind of 30-plus sensors and a big trunk with a lot of computers. We go out, we test drive this, and we test it and collect data all over the world. So it will be in Malaysia, it will be in U.S., of course, be in China. So all over the world, collecting data, sending that back to a certain data center provided by HP. And then we simulate the data, so we cannot leave all that roads traveled every night, and resimulate and test and run our features. So that's for the development phase. Then moving into production because validating autonomous driving is really complex, and you need also the customer fleet. So the kind of the Volvo Cars out on the street, we need those as well to test features and to send it back, doing dark launches and finally, be able to validate autonomous driving and switch it on. So that's kind of the life cycle of the data.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: And that's an amazing -- because it kind of -- process because I was there with you, right? So we drove through the streets of Gothenburg and seeing the amount of data you're collecting. It's just mind-boggling. Maybe you just can share with the audience here. How much data you have collected like in half an hour driving?</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS: Yes. No. So it's like 16 terabytes an hour, at least. And then we are running more than 100 petabytes of data just to get this -- yes, to get the entire system to work. And then you need to scrap continuously. So actually, the amount of data you collect is even greater than that.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: So now this is a perfect example from the edge-to-cloud kind of transition we are seeing, right? And the -- and how we create data. And to me, this is a perfect opportunity to derive insights of the edge. Obviously here, it's all about safety. As you think about the future, right, and HPE and Zenuity have partnered together to build this platform. Think about what going on -- what's going on in the process with the developers? Because obviously, in your company, everybody is a developer, right?</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS: Yes, absolutely. I mean what we're doing right now is working very intensively. We're also looking into the next levels. So we're having research activities in the field of AI, of course, federated computing and the next levels. And that's where we believe where we can actually train the neural networks out close to the cars, close to the different sites globally. And that's what you need to have that data loop, we call it the machine, to be up and running. And that's one of our key advantages to build this together with you.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: And it's all about intelligence and automation because one of the things are -- when you and I reviewed the project last time, obviously, the amount of automation in the platform to make the data available immediately to the developers. It's just amazing, the amount of software and integration that takes place.</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS: Exactly, and you need to search for the chronic cases, you need to have a good search algorithm to directly get the data in the hands of the developers, so you know exactly what to test for and what to understand. So that's really a key part of our process and our way of working.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, we are super proud to work with you, Dennis, and the Zenuity team. I think what you're doing is simply amazing. I mean Volvo is recognized for safety. It's a brand that everybody knows. And I'm sure you're going to position your company and also the Volvo brand in ways that people have never imagined before. But ultimately, it's all about driving that digital automation and transformation through a use case, I think it's going to change society forever, like you just said. And we're super proud to work with you and your team to provide you the infrastructure or the software and the services to be able to deliver against the unique vision.</p><p>DENNIS NOBELIUS: Thank you very much, Antonio. And autonomous driving is all about safety and data, and you're assisting with that. So thank you for leading this together with us.</p><p>ANTONIO FABIO NERI: Well, thank you for being with us today. That was an amazing example of Innovation HP can help you deliver to accelerate your own digital transformation. As you can see, the world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of small centers of data everywhere, highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a common cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to your data sources to create real-time insights everywhere.</p><p>Today, public clouds are extending their platforms into the data center in what Gartner calls distributed cloud. The problem is these solutions were architected to be very centralized and rely on connectivity to their control plane. They still don't address the other 70% of your apps and data. They are not open, and they don't enable up movement between other cloud platforms. Data transfer and egress is expensive. We know the realities of your enterprise. With HPE GreenLake, we deliver cloud services directly to your data in the environment of your choice with one consistent operating model and with visibility and governance of all your apps and data. And with more flexible financial terms to preserve your cash flow, all from one platform, to help you go even faster.</p><p>Today, I'm excited to introduce our next-generation of HPE GreenLake cloud services with point-and-click, self-serve simplicity. So you can quickly deliver services to your developers, data scientists and line of business so they can create solutions that they like to your customers, protect your business from risk and streamline your operations.</p><p>HPE GreenLake is delivering a whole new cloud experience, enabling you to explore our services, initiate a free trial and get pricing online. All of our new class services can be deployed and run on your choice of 17 pre-integrated workload optimized configurations available in small, medium and large sizes. These solutions can be delivered to your edge, colo or data center in as little as 14 days. And each one is pay-per-use, rapidly scalable and managed for you. For those who want the private cloud experience, we are launching a series of HPE GreenLake cloud services for virtual machine services, container cluster services, storage, (inaudible) and more as a service.</p><p>Through GreenLake central, you can provision VM and compare instances in just 5 clicks. We also introduced new cloud data protection services, which is an enterprise cloud backup service that modernizes backup and recovery and helps you get value from your data, all delivered with speed and agility without the data egress costs or locking. And to deliver against our edge-to-cloud platform strategy, we are enhancing a new cloud services for the Intelligent Edge. Based on the Aruba edge service platform, or ESP, to unify, secure and automate network operations and serve as the foundation for realizing the full potential of the edge. HPE GreenLake is the cloud that comes to you.</p><p>As we continue to transform HPE, software is a significant focus for us. Today, we have more than 8,000 software engineers, focused on you more than software for the most important part of our business. That is why I'm also very excited to introduce a new software portfolio, HPE Ezmeral and our first 2 offerings, HPE Ezmeral Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral ML Ops, both available as a software license or as a cloud service offering through HPE GreenLake. While most enterprises are investing in AI and machine learning, only 6% have a mature process to operationalize their ML models. With our HPE Ezmeral ML Ops software solution, data science teams can instantly spin up and scale containerized environments for their ML pipelines, with secured access to the data they need so they can deliver insights in minutes, not months. With the new HPE GreenLake ML Ops cloud services, you can bring DevOps agility to the end-to-end machine learning life cycle, to accelerate time to value for AI projects from pilot to production. I am really proud of what the teams have delivered here today as it shows tremendous progress towards our promise to transform HPE and to deliver everything to you as a service by 2022. We are building for your future. With our new HPE GreenLake cloud services, you have data egress charges ever. With the public cloud, users can pay 2x the costs for storing data just to get it back. More and more of you have shared how inflexible your public cloud costs actually are. With GreenLake, we give you much more flexibility to plan and land cost, how and when you want. Our offering is elastic and pay-per-use, providing the financial guardrails that fits your needs. With HPE GreenLake and our container services based on Kubernetes, you are not locked in. You can move those workloads and data to any public cloud later if that makes sense for you. And HPE Pointnext services can advise you on the placement of your workloads and data to maximize your budget and get the right mix across your hybrid estate. We have heard your concern about how some software companies are changing their cloud license in terms of requiring you to buy new licenses to move into a public cloud. Not with HPE GreenLake cloud services. You can use your existing licenses. If you have this issue, we are here to help.</p><p>Finally, in many cases, you can begin building your HPE GreenLake cloud with your existing infrastructure. We can help you repurpose it and move it to this model and potentially return value from those assets to fund your transformation. Over the last 3 years, we have returned to customers more than $0.5 billion to fund their transformation. As we continue to build the HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform and HPE Ezmeral software portfolio with greater automation, self-service and ease of use, we can unlock many more possibilities for you. You focus on your business, customers and data, we will do the rest.</p><p>We just covered a lot. We are in the age of insights and technology and digital transformation are more critical than ever before. HPE is answering the call to bring the right technology, people and economics to solve the world's most pressing problems.</p><p>We are driving the next wave of digital transformation, and the next wave will be to become digitally native in everything we do. This will be required in order to connect, protect, analyze and act in a new normal. We are committed to being the edge-to-cloud platform as a service company by transforming our portfolio to deliver meaningful customer outcomes.</p><p>So in closing, I want to say that I am more optimistic about the future than ever. In moments like this, people, communities and companies show the world who they truly are. At HPE, we are continuing to deliver on our purpose to advance the way people even work. It is how our founders, Bill and Dave, imagined our company, and it remains our North Star today.</p><p>I am incredibly proud of the innovation we continue to bring to market, but what is more important is our belief that technology's greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change to map our galaxies, to prevent future pandemics, to heal our environment. And that enormous impact is only possible because of you, our customers and partners.</p><p>Technology is enabling real tangible change and at HPE, we are leveraging our most powerful innovation so that you can accomplish more than ever before. I know we can and will get to this unprecedented time together. I am inspired and humbled by the humanity in your responses and recovery efforts. And our society is stronger for it. As we begin to reimagine a new and better world for ourselves, HPE is committed to helping each of you move forward. Thank you for joining us, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Please stay well and safe. Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: It won't be long now before we hear Keith White's much anticipated HPE GreenLake announcement. But before that, to shed some light on how HPE GreenLake is helping customers around the world is Mitsuyoshi Ogawa, joining me all the way from Japan, a very warm welcome.</p><p>You are the Vice President and General Manager of Pointnext Services, very warm welcome to you, Ogawa-san.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: I'd love to start off by, if you could just help us understand a bit more about your region, a bit more about businesses in Japan, how they've changed since the start of the year? And what is most concerning them right now?</p><p>MITSUYOSHI OGAWA, VP &amp; GENERAL MANAGER OF JAPAN POINTNEXT, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: (foreign language)</p><p>The Japanese government lifted the state of emergency. And then during the state of emergency, as you can imagine, okay, everything in the south, we closed the school and also the department stores are closed and the restaurants, et cetera. And also the business is the -- that a lot of the Japanese company closed their office and then start on their working at home. And then now we are trying to get back to the normal mode, but it's very different from before the COVID-19.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And you're saying that, of course, what's normal now was never normal before. But specifically, what challenges do you think the businesses are now looking to you to help them with?</p><p>MITSUYOSHI OGAWA: Yes. Sure. Actually, as I mentioned, some company still -- even, after we have lifted the state of emergency, that some of the company continue to work at home. And also, a company recently announced that the 15% of their employees continue to work at home permanently. So the -- every company is trying to change the work style. And also they are trying to enhance the remote work environment. So we are now trying to help that kind of the implementation of their remote working environment, such as implement faster resource infrastructure and also the enhance of their network. And also the implementing (inaudible) for the Microsoft solution, et cetera. So we are now helping from infrastructural point of view to drive the remote work environment.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: I suppose a lot of that, Ogawa-san, what you've been describing, would chime in with how Antonio has been talking about how HPE is here to help. We're hearing that phrase a lot at the moment, aren't we? Are there any more examples of how in your area in Japan, HPE is trying to help its customers?</p><p>MITSUYOSHI OGAWA: Sure. Actually, there are 2 aspects. So how we can help the people in Japan. And also, how we can have for our customers. So how we can help out the people in Japan with the [statement] of the vision? This is the kind of the global program for Aruba business. So we are now offering here to donate the temporary network, wireless network environment to the healthcare facilities. So in Japan, we have signed the temporary healthcare facility to handle the COVID-19. So we are providing the -- trying to providing the temporary wireless network to connect their healthcare equipment. So now we are discussing the 3 sites to help -- how we can help.</p><p>And secondly, how we can help the customer is that we continue to support, the on-site for the data center because the -- it's very important, business continuity for our customers. So we are supporting on-site data center continuity. And also we continue for the healthcare project at the customer side.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Ogawa-san, I'd love to talk more now about HPE GreenLake. Specifically in Japan, how are your customers responding to it? And how do you think it's been helping them?</p><p>MITSUYOSHI OGAWA: So we now are providing GreenLake model to our Japanese customers a lot. And there was recently after COVID-19, some of the client is serving for their cash flow. So we're now offering the buyback program, which is the buyback, the HPE existing infrastructure from them to us and then we providing HPE GreenLake model by using that infrastructure. So we're helping their cash flow. And also the -- as I mentioned, most of the company side remote working. And then they need to enhance their remote work environment. So we're providing a bunch of desktop infrastructure solution with HPE GreenLake.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: So great to get the Japanese perspective and Japanese experience. So many, many thanks to you, Mitsuyoshi Ogawa.</p><p>And thank you for your time. Right now, though, it's time for us to check back in with Tim. Tim?</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Thanks, Daisy. Great stuff. Keith White's spotlight is just around the corner. But before we hear from him, I want to bring in Erik Vogel. He's global Vice President of Customer Experience for HPE GreenLake. Erik, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So what do you think were the biggest takeaways from Antonio's keynote?</p><p>ERIK VOGEL, GLOBAL VP, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OF HPE GREENLAKE, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Well, I'll tell you what I'm most excited about is really hearing about our transformation to really becoming an as-a-service company. And a lot of those key points he was making about the new services we're launching and what's coming with HP. I think should be really exciting for everybody. I know it is for me, really positioning us as a true -- everything as a service edge-to-cloud company. And this is a new day for HP and a new day for GreenLake.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Given what you've heard from customers, how do you think they're going to respond to this GreenLake news?</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: Yes. The response up to this point has been fantastic. And I imagine that it's just going to continue that trend. What we've been hearing from customers, and then we talked to over 1,000 of them last year. What we're finding is they love that public cloud experience. And that is the new bar, the ability to get things easy, simple, fast. And we've responded. So HP GreenLake is responding to that by being able to provide that cloud experience for customers on-prem. We know that customers have moved a lot of the easy step to public cloud, and they've started to slow, and they're looking for a solution to address those applications that can't move in the on-prem environment, but they want to get that cloud-like experience, and that's what we're bringing with GreenLake to those customers. So the response has been tremendous, and we're going to continue to see that trend, I'm sure, because this is really what our customers are asking for. They're saying, we want a way to address those on-prem applications, but we want to put that experience that we love, which is that public cloud experience. So bringing that cloud experience to our customers, I'm sure we're going to see continued interest in these GreenLake solutions.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, Keith White's spotlight is just around the corner. And give us an idea of the anticipation around it and why customers are so excited to hear what he has to say.</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: Yes. I think what we're going to hear is really starting to focus on the solutions, how we're executing against those solutions, what customers can start buying and consuming and how it can really drive business value within their environment. We're going to hear from some customers who are leveraging GreenLake, how they're using it. And I think that's going to open the eyes of a lot of our customer base who might not be aware that really what GreenLake can do, especially if you're thinking about GreenLake from the historical perspective, it's more just a flexible capacity model, now really looking at it as a true cloud solution and all of the value that it can bring. So when we hear from Keith, I'm excited to hear some of the specific examples around the specific offers and specific services we're going to be launching and really getting into the heart of here is the value it can drive for our customers. I think that's going to be very exciting for all of our customers, not just existing GreenLake customers.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, a lot of big and exciting news are breaking today, Erik, thank you so much. And that moment is here, Keith's spotlight is about to start. Let's listen in.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>KEITH WHITE, GENERAL MANAGER OF GREENLAKE CLOUD SERVICES, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Hi, everyone. My name is Keith White, and I'm so excited to be leading the HPE GreenLake business. I joined HPE in January of 2020, and it's been a very interesting time for sure. I came from a long career at Microsoft, where my last role was leading the intelligent cloud business and Azure for the past several years. Now I've seen firsthand how our customers are digitally transforming and modernizing their environments and how the industry has accelerated to a hybrid and distributed cloud world to meet those needs.</p><p>I'm very excited to be at HPE. We're with the forefront of this transformation to help our customers across their entire hybrid estate. So welcome to all of you.</p><p>When I arrived at HPE, I found an amazing foundation in business within HPE GreenLake. To date, we have approximately 1,000 customers and $4 billion in contract value across 50 countries. HPE GreenLake is being used for several Fortune 500 companies and across all major industries. Now the customers I met with, they just love the value proposition of HPE GreenLake. It's a better way to deliver infrastructure as a service to them, all managed for them in a pay-per-use model in their data center, so they can reduce costs and focus their valuable resources on more critical and value-add efforts.</p><p>Now as Antonio mentioned in his keynote, there's a shift to distributed cloud and on-prem solutions across the market. Public clouds are extending their platform into the data center. And as I've experienced firsthand, distributed on-prem systems are totally different than a central control model of public cloud. We believe solutions need to be autonomous and not rely on connectivity back to the mother ship. They also need to be open, built on open source APIs, using tools like Kubernetes versus closed systems that essentially block app and data movement between cloud platforms. As we've demonstrated, HPE is here to help. We understand the realities and requirements of the enterprise, and I'm very excited to share what we've been up to.</p><p>Now in the next 30 minutes, we're going to try to accomplish 3 things. First, as Antonio and John Chambers discussed, we know your current and future efforts to digitize your operations and business models are not just aspirational, but they're reality today. Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with Tanja Vainio. Tanja is the Managing Director of ABB's robotics and automation business for their automotive and Tier 1 segment. We discussed how HPE and ABB are working together to define the factory of the future and help drive the success of our customers, and I'm really looking forward to sharing that conversation with you.</p><p>Second, I'll be joined by Arwa Kaddoura, who leads our HPE GreenLake go-to-market business, and she'll demonstrate the new catalog of HPE GreenLake services that we launched today. So I'll also walk us through an exciting and immersive look into HPE GreenLake to give us a sense of the breadth and depth of the platform and how easy it is to use these cloud services.</p><p>And finally, Kumar Sreekanti, HPE's Chief Technology Officer and Software General Manager, will join me to talk about how HPE Ezmeral, our newly launched modern software portfolio, and GreenLake together deliver our strategy to be an edge-to-cloud platform as a service company and bring tremendous value to our customers.</p><p>So let's jump in. So it starts with solving some core customer challenges. Our customers basically tell us that the public cloud gives them speed and agility, but only for about 30% of their apps and data. The other 70% of current and future workloads lack that same agile experience. They can't easily be refactored for the public cloud or they need to stay close to the data from a physical standpoint, and to the other apps at the edge or in colos or in data centers. As a result, most organizations are forced to deal with the complexity of 2 divergent operating models while paying higher cost to maintain them both.</p><p>With HPE GreenLake, we bring the agile cloud experience directly to the other 70% of current and future workloads. In a pay-per-use model, we provide one consistent operating model with visibility and control across your public clouds and on-prem environment. This applies to all your workloads, including cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications. Our approach delivers other benefits like no cloud lock-in, no data egress charges that you would otherwise incur when you want to move data out of the public cloud. You're free to use your existing third-party software licenses. And as part of running it all for you, we provide mission-critical support SLAs and much, much more. To accelerate our strategy to becoming the edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service company, today, we announced a new catalog of cloud services from HPE GreenLake that bring a variety of new capabilities to your developer, data science and DevOps teams as well as new services to help manage your cost and compliance across your hybrid estate. Accessible from hp.com or from within GreenLake Central, our new cloud services can be deployed on your choice of 17, pre-integrated workload optimized configurations available in small, medium and large sizes. These solutions can be delivered to your edge in a colo facility or data center in as little as 14 days. Each 1 is pay-per-use, rapidly scalable, self-serve, automated and managed for you. So you can focus those critical resources on your outcomes that matter the most.</p><p>Now I'm excited to introduce my first guest, Tanja Vainio of ABB. ABB is a global leader and pioneer in electrification, industrial automation, motion, robotics and discrete automation and power grids. Tanja is the Managing Director of Robotics and Automation for ABB's automotive and Tier 1 segment. We spoke last week about our exciting partnership to help accelerate their digital transformation and our shared vision for the factory of the future. Here's our conversation.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Hi, Tanja. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today. Let's first start with ABB's own digital transformation and the part that HPE has played in it. Now you're a fantastic HPE GreenLake customer. And that's inspired new ways of looking not just at your business but also how it can impact and totally transform industrial environments. Can you share with us more about the partnership and your efforts here?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO, INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, IMPACT COATINGS AB (PUBL): Thank you, Keith. First of all, building an ecosystem, together with leading industrial partners is key part of our strategy. And it's important for us, not only in our own digital journey, but also transforming the industries in the future. And HPE is a fantastic example of that. Together with our domain expertise, our products, our offering and HPE's expertise in IT infrastructure, we really can have end-to-end automation solution for our customers.</p><p>In our own operations, we use GreenLake solutions as key parts of our IT infrastructure, both for manufacturing and for process automation. And like you said, moving into our customers, one of the exciting developments and one of the common solution that is really exciting for me is the secure edge data centers.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Well, that's super interesting. How do you see the use cases manifesting themselves here?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: If you're edge data center, it is like a data center, but really with the physical size of an IT rack, offering ultimate flexibility. And we use it as an enabler to deploy the ABB Ability digital solutions and other IT solutions in the same platform, with practically any workflow directly at the premises of our customers. And it's really not only about productivity, security and efficiency. It's also about user experience. At Robotics and Automation, we focus on easy-to-use robotic applications. And it's very good fit with the GreenLake solutions that offer self-service, automation and management. And when we combine this together, we free up time for our customers to really focus on what is essential. Running their business and innovation.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: This is really where the power of HPE GreenLake comes into play. The as-a-service experience, bringing the power of self serve, automation and scalability into a pay-as-you-go environment. Can you share how GreenLake is bringing value to ABB and to your customers?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: It's all about speed and agility. And in today's ever-changing business environment, everybody needs to have the ability to react fast. And if your systems are holding you back, then it's really difficult to stay ahead of the trends and run your operations effectively. And you talked about future of industries, and future of industries are all about data-driven services. And it's all about flexibility. And if we combine the data-driven services with new business models, such as robotics as-a-service, that's an ultimate value-add for our customers and really the flexibility that they need because then you are able to access latest technologies and latest innovation, in my case, in robotics applications without the upfront investment, really using day-by-use model.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Well, you mentioned data and before you go, let's talk about how ABB is leveraging all the data you're gathering and analyzing as part of the factory of the future. Data is the lifeblood of any organization. And when you can pull the right insights from it, everything runs better, faster and more cost effectively. What are some of the outcomes that you're able to deliver here?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: Absolutely. And I'm happy that you say that it's not only about data because it's -- data is the basis, but then it's understanding the data and really delivering and making an action based on the data. And only disclosing the loop translates the data into productivity. And let me give you an example of one of the big manufacturers, where we have a large majority of the robots connected. We started to look at the locks of the robots, and we found out that some of the robots actually had micro-stoppages. So fast stoppages that even the operators could not really depict them and could not realize that this is happening. And we could only do that by reading the locks and reading the data. By correcting what was happening, we were able to really improve the productivity for our customers significantly. And it's not only about looking into the past. It's also about looking into the future and using the data in order to predict and really avoid any stoppages. And Keith, you mentioned a few days ago that in your experience, improving the productivity by 10% is often bringing bottom line improvements to our factories that are really a factor of 2, and I really support that with our experience. So with that, I'm super excited to continue the partnership with HPE because it really offers value for our customers with the end-to-end automation and bringing also the flexibility, combined with data analytics.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: That's just amazing, Tanja, thank you so much, and we're excited to continue the partnership as well. The factory, the future, bringing robotics-as-a-service and even this whole predictive maintenance strategy to improve efficiencies within the manufacturing scenario. It's just amazing. And frankly, so interesting. So thank you so much for taking the time. Really appreciate the opportunity to get a chance to talk with you and look forward to spending more time with you in the future. Thanks so much.</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: Thank you, Keith.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: I want to thank Tanja so much for taking the time to talk with me and share her story with us. The factory of the future, robotics-as-a-service and prescriptive maintenance are really game changers in the industry. I look forward to a lot more exciting and innovative solutions from our work together.</p><p>Now as you just heard, HPE GreenLake is bringing a whole new level of speed and agility to our customers' digital transformation and modernization efforts as well as their apps and data where they need to reside.</p><p>Now I'm pleased to introduce Arwa Kaddoura, our Vice President of Sales and go-to-market for the HPE GreenLake business.</p><p>She will take us through a demonstration of the newly announced GreenLake services as well as a guided tour of HPE GreenLake. Welcome, and take it away, Arwa.</p><p>ARWA KADDOURA, VP OF WORLDWIDE SALES, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Thank you, Keith. I'm excited to walk through some of the incredibly powerful features of HPE GreenLake and show you the experience it delivers. So let's get started.</p><p>I mentioned the experience. For the next-generation of cloud services from GreenLake, we've accelerated every step of your experience from pricing and delivery of services to provisioning on-prem resources on the fly, to driving insights across your multi-cloud environments. So let's start at hpe.com. The first thing we've done is to build an entirely new digital experience for HPE GreenLake, enabling our customers to explore our services, initiate free trials and get pricing online.</p><p>Let's take the example of virtual machines. I can select the virtual machine service, learn a little bit about the offer and go right into our pricing tool. We've structured our offers and what we're calling t-shirt sizes to make it simple to configure and price and super fast to deliver. In fact, once you've placed an order, you'll receive your HPE GreenLake solution in as little as 14 days. This rapidly accelerates the buying cycle for cloud services on-premises, enabling you to respond remarkably fast when new opportunities arise.</p><p>Let's see how this works. We're in the pricing tool for virtual machines. And now we're just going to size the workload, select the options we want and boom, we've got a price, all in about 8 to 9 clicks.</p><p>Now let's talk about another major innovation for HPE GreenLake, HPE GreenLake Central. GreenLake Central is really the hub of HPE GreenLake. It's a software platform that centralizes the operations and insights for all of the GreenLake services you're using. For example, there are widgets for cost and capacity and widgets for services like VMs, containers and ML Ops. So let's continue with our virtual machine example. You'll find a widget right here on the console that gives you high level KPIs about your VM environment, number of instances, utilization, et cetera. And if I want to provision a new instance, I can launch that right here from GreenLake Central. This self-service point-and-click experience gives developers the freedom they need to deploy code faster.</p><p>I'll show you. Let's select the type of incidence I want to spin up. Give it a name, select the network, define a schedule, review and complete. 5 clicks. That's how simple it is to deploy a new instance. We also announced an as-a-service container offering, built on our HPE Ezmeral Container Platform software. This container service brings speed and portability to both your cloud-native and non-cloud-native apps using open source Kubernetes. And we have a unique data fabric that provides persistent container storage for stateful apps.</p><p>Let's take a look. With HPE GreenLake Central, we can create a cluster right here from the main dashboard. Here, we click into the container widget, give our cluster a name, select a blueprint and create a cluster. Now our cluster is ready for our developers to use within the platform. That's all there is to it.</p><p>There's more to HPE Ezmeral than the container platform. We're also introducing our new ML Ops service. This is an end-to-end data science platform that brings DevOps agility to the machine learning cycle in your own environment. Your data science teams can instantly spin up and scale containerized machine learning environments with a rich set of tools to build their models and secure access to the data that they need.</p><p>Now enterprises can turn their AI experiments into operational deployments, which is critical in our age of insights, and it's all available through HPE GreenLake. The new service is, of course, integrated into HPE GreenLake Central. So it simplifies IT admin tasks, and lets data scientists focus on their work. Here, within what we call the ML Ops work bench, I can create a new project. And as services are consumed by the users, I can track usage and costs right from the main dashboard.</p><p>Speaking of managing usage and costs, let's keep going with the demo. One of the key pain points for IT executives and the line of business is managing costs across hybrid cloud environments. Without the visibility GreenLake delivers, it's really hard to do and costs can quickly spin out of control. With HPE GreenLake Central, we integrate cost KPIs into the dashboard, so you can easily see your current monthly costs by service, by location, by any number of different criteria. And see how your spend is increasing or decreasing over time. And because HPE GreenLake has such a sophisticated metering engine, you now get self-service visibility into who is using? How much? Of which resources? So you can make better decisions about where to optimize costs. What's even more powerful, as you can see here, is that we give you the ability to connect your public cloud subscriptions and get a holistic view across your entire hybrid estate. Now let's take a look at our capacity management capabilities. Our goal with HPE GreenLake is to make sure that you always have capacity ahead of your business demand not overprovisioned, not underprovisioned, but safely in the green zone that you see on this chart.</p><p>Part of the HPE GreenLake service is active capacity management, which means we're always monitoring your environment and working with you to align your capacity with business needs. This keeps you from buying for the high watermark, and that saves you upward of 30% to 40%.</p><p>The last thing we're going to look at is compliance. With our continuous compliance capabilities, our experts work with you to tailor frameworks according to your specific needs and requirements, selecting from over 1,500 controls to ensure compliance across a wide range of areas, HIPAA, GDPR and so on. The continuous compliance widget shows the status of the automated compliance controls so you can easily spot failures. And it gives you a detailed view of your compliance status with remediation guidance to keep your business protected. I hope you're as excited as I am with all the new great capabilities and services we're rolling out.</p><p>HPE GreenLake is really delivering the cloud experience everywhere across our data centers, colos and edges and providing new levels of speed, ease and value. Pretty cool, isn't it? Now back over to you, Keith.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Thanks, Arwa. As you can see, we put a lot into the new HPE GreenLake with point-and-click, self-serve simplicity, so you can quickly order, price, configure and operate new services for your developers, designers, engineers and data scientists. And with deep integration around cost and compliance, including Azure and AWS, you can truly manage and optimize your entire hybrid estate, all managed for you by HPE Pointnext and our partners.</p><p>I'm excited to welcome in Kumar Sreekanti. He's HPE, CTO and Head of Software, and he's going to help me introduce the new Ezmeral software portfolio and the unique capabilities it brings to HPE GreenLake. Professor, welcome, and congrats on the announcement.</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: It's great to be here, Keith. Thank you.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Awesome. Well, as Antonio mentioned, we're becoming a cloud services and software company. Can you share with us this Ezmeral news and help us understand what it is?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes. You bet. We announced at the Discover as a part of Antonio's keynote, HPE software platform branded Ezmeral. It's essentially encompasses our container platform, our data fabric and our various solutions, including ML Ops. It allows our customers to run, manage, control, secure their data and applications. It's built on a proven technologies from BlueData, MapR as well as organic technology of InfoSight and others that we are in HPE. This is a very powerful platform. It provides the customers to give ability to run both stateful and stateless applications, meaning legacy and non-legacy applications like CNCF. And it is a very unique innovation and very unique opportunity for us. It's not only available to the customers to run on their hardware as well as a part of the GreenLake.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Love it. No, that's exciting. And so as you think about your overall software strategy, does this -- how does Ezmeral sort of manifest itself inside this broader strategy you're going after?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Very good question, Keith. So as you and I have talked many times, think of our strategy, HPE strategy going forward on the 2 axis. On the horizontal axis is what is GreenLake, which is part of the GreenLake team builds and develops to build, what I call, a fleet software, automated, secure, elastic, scalable, and optimized software that allows us to run large number of applications in a repeated fashion, Ezmeral is on the vertical axis, that's a runtime software that allows us to build workload optimized applications that are very efficient and it provides the customer best cost for the workload. And together, these 2 is our go-forward strategy that allow us to help build HPE's one-of-the-top software platforms that provides the GreenLake, the ability to give the customers the solutions.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Got it. So you mentioned a couple of things that I thought were really interesting. One is the most value or best value per workload, then the efficiency. So how should our audience think about HPE from a software standpoint and the differentiation and unique value that we bring to our customers?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: A very good question. In fact, there are many differentiations. So I'll start with -- we are -- HP is one of the most innovative hardware companies. So we are actually not only giving the customers the workload optimized on the software as well as on the hardware. Focusing on the HPE Ezmeral platform, HPE Ezmeral platform is of -- only of its kind that allows both stateful and stateless workloads. In other words, customers don't have to lift and shift and run everything on a CNCF or repurpose modernize applications overnight, which allows us to run both applications in a uniform fashion under one pane of glass.</p><p>In addition, all our software will be available through GreenLake on a pay-per-view basis managed for our customers by the GreenLake team, which focus on elastic, scalable and complete runtime stack. There's a lot more on my blog that customers can actually have details around this.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Great. I'm excited to read that and get -- and thanks for the clarity on that. That's super helpful. So shifting gears over to your role as CTO. You've talked about the world being hybrid. You've talked about digital transformation as being an imperative. How are we helping customers as a company, especially in this COVID environment to really continue the acceleration around this transformation and hybrid world?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes. It's very good question. We've been spending a lot of time with the customers. I know some of sometimes, in fact, even this morning, we were on a call together with some of our key partners. I think COVID magnified the digital transformation by an order of magnitude, right? We have always believed you can take the data to the compute. I think a lot of people have tried it. I think we want to take compute to the data, and we have a unique advantage as an edge-to-cloud platform. As-a-service company, we understand. So what we are really noticing customers are saying is, we are collecting the data where you collect. And we want to make sure we want to have the ability, whether it is edge, it's a data center. It's a GreenLake, it's the cloud. It doesn't matter for us. We want to have a seamless ability for customers to provide a complete solution. That's exactly what we just talked about, Ezmeral software and GreenLake software. So we also notice that as a part of this COVID, people want to modernize their applications. And if you notice them, they can modernize overnight, and this is where our Ezmeral platform allows, you can actually run both legacy applications and a cloud-native applications under the same umbrella of -- single pane of glass.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: No. That's fantastic. Again, frankly, you and I spend a lot of time with customers. This should actually enable a whole new set of experiences for our customers. Can you share us -- share with us a little bit about how we're focusing here?</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: Yes. So you and I've talked about this many times, right, the era of trying to sell isolated summer isolated storage instances. It is over. Customers are looking for outcomes and solutions. What we have talked about earlier in the conversation, customers are looking for a complete experience solutions, this is what we are focused on. This is what the GreenLake team is focused on. An example of that is ML Ops that we just announced ML Ops as a service, so that in the context of AI/ML, customers can focus on building the model and running the models as opposed to worrying about how do you actually train, build and life cycle the model management. And we are just getting started.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Thank you, Kumar. Super insightful. I learn something new from you every single time we talk. So thanks so much.</p><p>KUMAR SREEKANTI: It's been a pleasure, Keith. Good partnership here.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Thanks, Kumar. That was super insightful. Now both Kumar and I couldn't have chosen a better time to join HPE. We're excited about this market opportunity and what we're hearing from our customers about the value we can bring to their transformation and modernization efforts.</p><p>Now we rely so heavily on our partner ecosystem to bring solutions to our customers. And as part of the transformation to an as-a-service company, we're expanding and deepening our engagement with many system integrators, ISVs, MSPs, colos and telcos, along with our traditional reseller and disti partners. As you can see, we've made a lot of headway here. And although we're all experiencing challenging times, HPE is here to help. We want to help you manage through your current realities and accelerate your plans for the future.</p><p>So to summarize, HP GreenLake provides the market-leading IT-as-a-service platform, for delivering the modern cloud experience to customers' applications, data and workloads in their location, at the edge, in a colo, in the data center and in the cloud. And we do this in a self-served pay-per-use all-managed as-a-service by HPE Pointnext and our partners. We provide customers with the ability to pay for what they use to eliminate overprovisioning and free up capital, especially in these challenging times. We ensure customers always have capacity ahead of demand and provide the speed and agility they need to rapidly innovate and meet their customer needs. You saw this with ABB. All of this with no cloud lock-in, no data egress charges and the flexibility to leverage your existing investments.</p><p>We invite you to visit us on the web, and please attend these additional sessions and demos to learn more or reach out to one of our HPE representatives and request a trial. Thank you so much for spending the time with us. We're really excited to have the opportunity to partner with you on your digital transformation and modernization journey.</p><p>Thanks, and have a great day.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Okay. Great stuff there. You have it. Keith White's much anticipated spotlight, really drilling down on HPE GreenLake's new capabilities and how the cloud experience is being ramped up to a whole new level.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: That's right, Daisy. Keith focused on HPE GreenLake's commitment to customers and their support through this next wave of digital transformation. He talked about delivering a new cloud experience at faster speeds than ever, really bringing agility and insights into workloads and places that traditional cloud cannot.</p><p>Now to help us unpack everything that Keith said, we have Erik Vogel with us here again. Hey, Erik. Good to see you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: How do Keith's announcements show HPE's commitment to being an edge-to-cloud everything as a service company?</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: What we just heard, and what's really exciting with the launch of the new services, the everything as a services and solutions that we've launched, it really now is positioning us squarely in that everything as a Service space and providing that as a cloud service. And it's not a service that our customers have come to expect and come to demand from us. So this is really exciting for us.</p><p>If you look at some of these specific services around virtual machines and containers, this is a cloud experience. This is very similar to what our customers are already seeing and used to in public cloud, but now we're doing it on-prem. And we're putting it where they need it, when they need it. So significant advancement. This is really exciting stuff.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Erik, how have customers been using HPE GreenLake? Give us some examples of what they're doing with the technology.</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: Yes. What really started out as -- so if you think back, GreenLake, historically, was very much around flexible capacity, giving customers the ability to adjust how they pay for this solution. So moving from a traditional CapEx model, where they have to go buy a whole bunch of gear and then begin to consume it and moving to a true consumption economic model, where they could basically pay for what they were using.</p><p>The next step, and what we're seeing now with customers is they want that end-to-end experience, that cloud experience. They don't want to have to manage the infrastructure. They don't want to have to deal with it in their data centers. They want HPE to take care of that, and they want that point and click ease, that simplicity of cloud for that infrastructure.</p><p>So this is what we're seeing our clients moving into. They're saying, \"Hey, for our data center consolidation, we've got to quickly go in and provision our virtual machines or our virtual targets. We don't want to have to go stand up the hardware and provision it and do all of that. We just want to point and click and provision those targets and migrate these applications and move these applications. And we want it for our virtual machines. We want it for our containers. We want you to make it fast and easy for us.\"</p><p>And that's how we're going to see customers begin to use this as a true cloud solution, again, sitting where their apps and data reside, which is the on-prem, the colo or at the edge, which is really unique and innovative for those clients.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Look, this is a crowded market. So how much of a differentiator in the marketplace are the new HPE GreenLake solutions?</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: Yes. This is -- well, it's a crowded space. What we're doing, I don't think anybody else is doing today. This is very unique. We are able to take these high-value services with the infrastructure HPE is known for, provided as a cloud service with a cloud experience and put it directly where the customer wants it, where the applications and data reside. That is key. And that is a significant differentiation between what the public cloud providers can do and even what our other competitors, traditional competitors are doing because we're marrying the best of what public cloud offers with the best of the on-prem infrastructure capabilities. So giving customers the control, the regulatory requirements that they have, being able to meet those by having this sitting within their data center, giving them the performance and the low latency. Things they couldn't achieve with one or the other, we're bringing the best of both worlds to our clients, very differentiated.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, given this news, I'm expecting that you're already starting to hear from customers at this point. How do you think they're going to respond?</p><p>ERIK VOGEL: I'm sure the response will be tremendous. It was tremendous before. After -- especially as we started to get into this whole COVID shutdown in March, we really started to see more and more interest in GreenLake solutions. And now with these announcements, where we're really making it and providing that cloud-like experience, we expect that demand to continue.</p><p>This is a real option for our customers. This is something they have been asking for and they've been demanding, and we expect that demand to continue in the future.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Awesome. Really exciting news, Erik. Thanks so much for sharing your insights with us and with the audience around the world. Daisy, back to you.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Thank you, Tim. I really think one of the highlights from Keith's spotlight was that interview with an early adopter of HPE GreenLake's new capabilities, ABB.</p><p>Now Keith sat down with the Managing Director of Robotics and Automation. Let's hear what they had to say.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Thanks so much, Tanja, for taking the time to way talk with us. Now obviously, there's been a lot of challenges going on in the world today. So I'm excited to talk with you about the road to recovery. Now you've been quick to respond to the needs of factories and fulfillment centers as they're just now beginning to come back online. Tell us a little bit about how you supported your customers during this uncertain time.</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: In the last months, the remote services suddenly became super important. And to respond to our customers' needs, we made our connected services and all the remote support free of charge to our customers until the end of the year. And it's not only about connected services and remote support. We are also looking at innovative ways to do factory acceptances. So we have now a remote factory acceptance test, but also how we deliver services in general. So we are looking at new ways to do service and maintenance using artificial intelligence and virtual reality. And with that, we are able to support our customers in new ways in this new situation.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Now do you see that combination of automation and robotics becoming more relevant in a world struggling through a pandemic?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I guess this would be the case even without the pandemic. But for sure, pandemic is accelerating this development. At very first step, it was about, how do we ensure the safety in the factories? And how do we deliver remote services? Now in the second step, it's more about supporting our customers how to bring the factory loads back to the normal level, and, at the same time, keeping the rules for social distancing and making sure that employees stay safe. So with that, I believe that robotics and automation will continue to be key pillars moving forward, and this will be accelerated now with the new situation that everyone is facing.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: And how do you see the outlook of factory of the future driving operational equipment efficiency, given some of the global economic recovery forecasts?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I would not tie robotics and automation to any economic forecast. Because at the end of the day, we need to deliver value for our customers from day 1. That said, for sure, one aspect of factory automation and robotics is becoming more important than ever before, and this is flexibility. So I do believe that the current situation and the need for flexibility will actually drive the demand for robotics and automation even more than before.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: So does the pandemic delay or accelerate our journey to a more digital production line?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I believe that the situation will accelerate the digitalization actually throughout our lives, not only in the industry. Because everyone needs to be prepared if something like this happens in the future. And this is also the feedback that I hear from our customers. The ability to run businesses without stoppages in any situation as well as ability to ensure the workers' safety is priority #1. And with that, we are really looking forward, robotics and automation being the key drivers for industry moving forward.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Now you've spoken recently about the ongoing need for female diversity in STEM. Can you share some of your thoughts on the concepts of diversity for women, especially as it relates to innovation and challenging our own thinking?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I think diversity is more important than ever before because we cannot solve new challenges with the past methods in today's world, and that requires innovation. And innovation requires challenging our thinking. And in all honesty, it is not always easy to challenge our thinking because we really have to be prepared to see the other side of the things. But only by doing that and only by challenging our thinking, we can move forward.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: Well, as the pace of innovation continues to accelerate, how does this idea of the diversity of thought play into the future of technology?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I believe it plays a key part of that. Just looking at what we do in ABB robotics at the moment. We are looking at -- and we are having the most innovative robotics portfolio that is really the widest in the whole industry. And in addition to that, we are now combining it with automation portfolio from Vienna. So that whole requires innovation moving forward. And we are not stopping there. We have an incubator for artificial intelligence. We have an incubator for collaborative robots, for health care, for digital automation, just to name a few. We are investing in software, in artificial intelligence.</p><p>And that all requires innovation. And we come back to diversity. And of course, diversity comes in all senses and forms. So we talk about age diversity, we talk about gender diversity, we talk about cultural diversity. But I think in the technology, in the world of technology, where there is less females, gender diversity is a top priority.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: 100% agree. Now ABB and HPE are working together on projects right now that have the ability to rapidly transform productivity, agility and safety in the world's industrial environments. What's the most exciting thing for you about being part of that right now?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: I work in an automotive industry and with automotive industry. And I believe that this industry is maybe in front of biggest transformation ever. We are looking, for example, how do we move from inflexible production lines into flexible production cell concept that allows customers to manufacture different parts in one line. And that alone is exciting. But if you look at it from end-to-end perspective, it's not only about manufacturing infrastructure. You can really provide value to our customers by combining the manufacturing infrastructure with IT infrastructure. And that's where the partnership with HPE comes into play, and being able to offer that whole package for our customers is super exciting for me.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: We really appreciate the opportunity to partner with you on this. Can you tell us why you chose HPE to be your partner here?</p><p>TANJA VAINIO: For ABB, foundation of an ecosystem with selected industrial key players is an integral part of our strategy and really needed to transform industrial environments in the future. And HPE is a wonderful example of that. Combining ABB's product solutions and our vast domain expertise together with HPE's expertise in IT infrastructure, we can offer our customers end-to-end automation solutions, providing reliability, productivity, flexibility and even worker safety.</p><p>KEITH WHITE: That's fantastic. We really appreciate the partnership and really appreciate you spending some time with us. Thank you so much, Tanja.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, that was a really fascinating interview from Keith. Why? We heard some interesting insights about how that HPE ABB partnership is reshaping the future of manufacturing.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: That's right, Daisy. And we are just around the corner from hearing Irv Rothman, the President and Chief Executive Officer of HPE Financial Services, deliver his spotlight. And definitely a critical voice that customers want to hear from as businesses look to recover and reshape their future during this challenging time.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, Tim, there really is a lot of excitement around Irv's spotlight coming up in just a little while.</p><p>Now HPE Financial Services has been a critical help to customers in the face of this pandemic. We're now really helping enterprises address key issues like cash flow. But as businesses switch gears, looking to the long road ahead, many have completely rethought their business models and IT budgets.</p><p>Now joining me now to give us some deeper analysis is Jenny Marinaro, Vice President of Global Strategy at HPE Financial Services; and also Susan Middleton, Director of Flexible Consumption and Financing Strategies IDC. Ladies, thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Susan, I want to start with you. We've heard a lot from some of the immediate needs customers are facing or did face rather when the pandemic first hit. But I'd love you to tell me now where businesses are now, what they think their most critical needs are now to get them into recovery.</p><p>SUSAN G. MIDDLETON, RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR TECHNOLOGY FINANCING STRATEGIES, INTERNATIONAL DATA CORPORATION: We've talked a lot about disruption at IDC, but this is the ultimate disruption. But now where we are is customers have come to the other side, and organizations are starting to take a serious look at, what worked? And what didn't work? What do they need to focus on to continue to support all the changes that have taken place over the last few months?</p><p>So for instance, we're seeing things like there was immediate need for work from home. But going forward, is that going to still matter? And we're finding that a lot of organizations are saying, \"You know what? We were still productive. We were able to work with our clients. So if there's not an urgent need to go back into the office, let's continue to support that.\" But that means making sure that not only do all your employees have the right equipment they need, they need VPN access. They need bandwidth. They need remote support.</p><p>When we look at consumers, when we were all in shutdown, what mattered most to us in terms of supply chain was making sure that we had groceries, toilet paper, things like that. For organizations, it was much more about setting up all your end users to be remote. And if those services and support did not work, then that was a really red flag for what your future investment strategies need to be going forward.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Jenny, similar question to you. Obviously, as Susan was saying there, we all had that initial firefighting stage, where we're just struggling to keep afloat to mix my metaphors. But of course, now we are in a different stage. And how do you think customers are facing this new stage. And what do they need?</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO, VP OF GLOBAL STRATEGY &amp; GO-TO-MARKET EXECUTION, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Well, it's been such an interesting time, right?. We all keep saying that people, whose life was about digital, long-term transformation, had to suddenly become very new to in very real terms to solve those problems. And as they're coming out of the crisis and looking forward, what we're hearing is they're looking at a very new tomorrow. It's not the tomorrow they envisioned in their 2020 business plan. It's something that has catapulted forward. A lot of technology got deployed rapidly through the pandemic period, and it's created the possibility of accelerated transformation. What we're hearing from customers is they want to seize that. They want to do different things, but they are kind of also between the devil and the deep blue sea in the sense of a huge amount of uncertainty. And a lot of what people have gone through already has created deficits in their budget. They are -- they're depleted in a lot of ways. So we're talking to a lot of customers about, how do they seize that new tomorrow? How do they embrace the digital leap that they've been through as it were? And how do they do it right now rather than wait for a 2020 budget or true post-COVID situation?</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: I think that's so interesting, that phrase you said there about accelerated transformation because that is how it looks from the outside. But then when you start to see what it would feel like from the inside for most businesses or most individuals, most of them feel exhausted in some way or another. Lives have spent either financially or physically all their employees. So it is like this totally disruptive state, but there's not a lot of gas in the tank.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: That's exactly right. Because for a lot of businesses, their revenue streams haven't come back. So what do CFOs do when you don't have revenue coming in? You lock down expense going out. So it creates almost like the rock and a hard place. I keep mixing metaphors today, but it's really tough. You see the opportunity, but you're seeing it behind a locked gate. So the key to that lock is financial vitality.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Susan, similarly, on that point of businesses feeling depleted and exhausted, whether it's physically or financially. That is the sort of the state that a lot of companies find themselves in right now.</p><p>SUSAN G. MIDDLETON: One of the first reactions within this change for how to respond to the pandemic was CFOs looked at I'm going to conserve as much capital and cash as I can. So in order to fulfill needs for employees that were working from home, we saw a lot of focus on alternative methods. So instead of using capital, using operating budgets. So that was great for short term leasing. It was great for flexible financial models like as a service and pay as you go.</p><p>And it also, we saw -- another reliance was to use certified used equipment. So anything that could reduce the price tag was deployed immediately. And frankly, I think that's going to be the outlook for most of 2020 because Jenny pointed out that revenue has not come back yet for a lot of these companies. So they recognize that to improve their productivity, they need to be much smarter about how they're going to budget their money and what they're going to spend it on. So I expect to see continued investment in those types of models as CFOs and IT managers look at more innovative ways to conserve money, but meet the capacity requirements that they need going forward.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: There's a lot in that inbox. Jenny, talking about the inbox, I'd like to ask you specifically about HPE Financial Services. Just tell us a little bit more about how they're helping businesses in the way that Susan was just talking about, reimagine their IT infrastructure.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: We're asking people to think very differently, to innovate, to capture Susan's word, in how they think about infrastructure. So the things that we have, like old IT, pre-owned IT, they really gives some strategic thought to the placement of those things within their IT infrastructure. The truth is a lot of dollars get used every year in upgrading systems that are essentially giving end users the same functionality. And we're saying like maybe you don't need to do that. Maybe you can use pre-owned equipment to stabilize and reduce your expenditure on maintaining functionality. And that gives you the option of investing in a lot more new, and, again, thinking about that in a very different way.</p><p>So one of the solutions that's super popular right now is what we call accelerated migration, and it's a process of us looking at the infrastructure customers already have in place and talking about really doing 2 things. One is turning it instantly almost like imagine a magic wand, turning that infrastructure immediately into an as a service platform, so customers can pay as they use.</p><p>And the second is turning it into a source of capital, literally buying out the IT infrastructure that a customer has to create the kind of cash infusion that allows them to invest in innovation projects. So we've been really trying to bring customers to a place where they can think about their entire tech estate and think about it in terms of what's maintaining functionality? What needs to transform to as a service? And what can become a source of income that I can use to really propel my transformation efforts forward?</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Susan, I just want to turn now to as a service models and what the crisis has done as far as shining a light on to them.</p><p>SUSAN G. MIDDLETON: This is definitely a tipping point, I think, in terms of market awareness and adoption for as a service models. So we just did a survey at the end of May, and we asked about interest in as a service models. And over 43% of the respondents worldwide said, \"Yes. That is something that we're definitely going to take a significant look at.\" It removes a lot of the pain points that we're hearing customers talk about today. So remote service and monitoring, being able to deploy the assets immediately. Someone is monitoring at all times to make sure that you're meeting the service levels that you require. You're meeting the capacity needs that you require. If you need more capacity, it's there. If there's a chance that you need to detune a little bit and slow down, that option exists as well.</p><p>The adoption trend is there. We started with very large organizations. Now we're seeing mid-sized organizations look at it. But there's a great play there for mid- and small-sized companies. And I do think now, when you're looking at, how could I have responded faster? These models provide a lot that can help organizations. And a big piece of this, too, is the whole automation.</p><p>As a service models are being monitored constantly. So that is happening all behind the scenes. So that if you're an organization that had so many different fires to put out basically through this process, if you had an as a service model already deployed, that was happening for you. So you could focus on other urgent needs within your organization. So I think a lot of the tales that have come out of this process, you're going to see a lot of those adopters of these models really tout how well this worked for them.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Jenny, do you agree? Or were you surprised by Susan's market research that the tide seems to be turning on those models?</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: No. For me, Daisy, it's all part of that digital leap forward the companies have made. Something that people might have had their toe in the water was on the plan for 2021, 2022 all of a sudden hit home. It's like, yes, if we've done this now, we'd be in a better place. So whether it's the as a service move, whether it's trialing with things like pre-owned, whether it's building flexibility around systems, you have to keep super secured, so they have to stay on-prem, I think everybody is certainly saying, \"I can't wait for 2022. I need to do it now.\" So to me, it totally makes sense. And it's totally in that framework of the digital leap.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Jenny, we know that Irv Rothman's spotlight is just around the corner. And from what I'm led to believe, an interview you did with Nationwide Building Society will be part of it. And obviously, I don't want you to give too much away, but can you give us a little sense of what we're going to hear?</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Yes. And actually, I was speaking with a lady called Debbie Hubbard from Nationwide. And it's a fascinating story because it covers a whole bunch of instances where Nationwide has taken quite a different approach to how they've spun their technology. So she's going to talk about what they did during the COVID crisis. She's also going to talk about what they've done more systemically as well as a big picture commitment they have to sustainability and a circular economy. It's practical. It's results-oriented. And I think it will be super in terms of first-hand experience customers can take on board themselves after they hit the spotlight.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Susan, anything that you're particularly keen or looking forward to hearing?</p><p>SUSAN G. MIDDLETON: So it's interesting the sustainability and circular economy angle. Because we're finding that one of -- when customers put as a service models in place, there were a lot of different pieces of that, that they recognized would help their organization. But we're definitely finding, through surveys and our research, that now they're starting to focus on other intangible topics that might not have been related necessarily to cost and support. But the whole concept of having safe and secure disposal has become paramount for clients. And they're also looking at refurbished gear. So if you take that gear out of my sight, it's good to know that it's going to be repurposed and reused someplace else because that helps the whole circular economy discussion. And as we've seen, and as you have talked about a lot, Jenny, we're seeing organizations really get behind that mindset that they don't want to be innovated to insecure, disposal, e-waste and a lot of the recycling issues that you hear about. So anything that can be done there is really gratifying for clients right now.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Now, Jenny, I don't know whether you can tell Susan whether she's going to hear what she wants to hear. I don't know if you can give us a sneak peak of what the highlights should be in this presentation.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Well, Irv has 30-plus years experience working directly with CIOs and CFOs. And he's going to bring together in the spotlight the thinking of both leaders to give people a path forward. So whether it's just shoring up the coffer so you can run what you need to today or it's about building tomorrow, he's going to be talking about that. And sustainability is such a huge part of it. And you have to have that practical part that Susan talked about, things like you have to have locked down, rock-solid data security. So I think you can look forward to Irv addressing some of those topics as he speaks. It's going to be a great spotlight.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO OF HPE FINANCIAL SERVICES, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Hello out there, everybody, and thanks so much for joining us today. This steep line you see here is not the unemployment rate or any sort of debt number. Now we've seen a lot of similar trending curves recently, haven't we? But this one, I believe, tells us everything we need to know about 2020 so far. It's actually the use of the word unprecedented in online media.</p><p>Now we've just lived through 6 months of incredible history, painful for many, intense and strenuous for all and maybe even inspiring at times. One thing we can all agree on is that these last few months have acted as oxygen on the flame of change.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, working from home was not that unusual, but not practiced by all. Now it's everywhere, and it could be the future of work for many. So do you think the majority of your workforce will be location-independent anytime soon? And have you started envisioning the implications? Many business models are changing or will change, and the questions we face can be daunting. So how do we embrace these tectonic shifts even as we face economic challenges and uncertainty? How do you prepare for and build what's next when, in just a few weeks, your IT budgets can be depleted, delayed or maybe even shut down? And quite importantly, how can we do some good along the way? Can we build a more sustainable IT? So businesses and the planet can thrive. And it's not one or the other.</p><p>To take a step back and fuel our determination, I'll soon be joined by customers who are working to reimagine their IT estate. Renowned technology analyst, Jeremiah Owyang, will also share his perspectives on opportunities for the new world.</p><p>So let's get started. If you're here today, you probably think as I do that digital transformation can do extraordinary things. Virtually every company is a technology company, and digital drives the world today, more so than maybe even just a few weeks back. But this dynamic is not without consequences. I'm sure you're concerned by the amount of e-waste that increases exponentially as the world population grows and access to technology expands. In fact, e-waste will exceed 50 million tons in 2020. It's 2% of all solid waste. That doesn't seem like a big percentage, right? But consider e-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, and it now accounts for up to 70% of the toxic waste just in U.S. landfills alone.</p><p>Our industry simply cannot turn a blind eye to this.</p><p>HPE has designed an overall approach to sustainability and a more circular economy. And it all starts with product design and manufacture. There are innovations around materials, energy efficiency and recyclability. And when the products are used, it's about optimizing the IT infrastructure to reduce energy and waste.</p><p>Now a key component of this is HPE's pivot to offer its entire portfolio as a service. This eliminates overprovisioning as near real-time usage information leads to higher utilization while avoiding the cost of depreciating or idling equipment.</p><p>And finally, at end of use. Whether your technology is aging or simply unused, we partner with you to wage a war on e-waste. We own and operate 2 substantial technology renewal centers, 400,000 square feet in total. One is on the U.S. East Coast and the other one's in Scotland. And in each location, your technology, from 52 countries in 2019, is taken in and refurbished. The data is properly and securely overwritten, and then it is reused.</p><p>Now beyond the planet's well-being, there is a business benefit to this. We see this war on e-waste as an enabler for your business. How so? Jenny Marinaro, our VP Strategy, sat down with Debbie Hubbard from Nationwide Building Society to help paint the picture and let you imagine how this could work for you. So let's hear from Jenny and Debbie now.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Well, welcome, Debbie, and thank you for joining us.</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD, TECHNICAL SERVICE MANAGER, NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY: Thank you.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Why don't we start by talking about Nationwide? I know it's a very special organization with a very special mission.</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: Yes. So Nationwide was founded in around 1984, where a group of people got together, built their savings to help someone else buy their first home. That ethos for Nationwide continued since then. So we now help many first-time buyers. Last year, it was 1 in 6. First-time buyers get into their first home. So it's really important to us, that culture of helping people. We were one of the first to come up with our Internet banking offering in 1997. One of the -- a group of organizations, who are in the first wave, who adopted Apple Pay, which, in the current environment that we have, contactless payment has become all the more important. So the innovation agenda is still there to this stage.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Now I believe your role in that innovation agenda is about equipping the people of Nationwide with the technology, the devices and the tools they need to be successful. Why don't you tell us a little bit more about that?</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: So we support around 20,000 colleagues. They work in a variety of locations. They're geographically spread throughout the U.K. They're also doing a variety of different roles. So everything from people in a branch, people in contact centers to IT professionals, they all require desktops, laptops or mobile devices. So our team supports the provision of those and the support of it throughout its life.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: So 20,000 end users, that has the potential to be a great deal of e-waste, but I know that's something you and Nationwide are very committed to making sure it doesn't happen. Can you tell us more about your sustainability agenda?</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: The sustainability is really important in Nationwide. We try to send 0 waste to landfill. We're Carbon Trust Accredited. We look to make sure that when we take the device on, we look to build it through its life cycle with the user. Then once we're finished with it in terms of our estate, we send it off to be upcycled, so that it can have its next life.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: And how did you get started, Debbie?</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: We had started to lease with HPFS, and it became a natural addition when we discovered the asset upcycling service to investigate that and look at what it would mean to Nationwide.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Well, the environmental benefits from asset upcycling are pretty clear, but IT equipment, particularly end user devices, often store some pretty sensitive information. Were you concerned about that at all?</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: Certainly, we -- data security is obviously really, really important for financial services. We've got to consider that the data that we hold for our members is something that's very important and very precious. So we have to make sure, at the end of the time that we've used the IT equipment, that we dispose of that in a secure fashion. We've got to ensure that we meet all our regulatory compliance.</p><p>But it's more than just that. It's about doing the right thing. We're also very conscious of our sustainable footprint on the world, as a lot of organizations are. So we're looking to make sure that everything's dealt within a sustainable fashion.</p><p>We also -- obviously, there's an economic benefit to working with HPFS. The asset upcycling means that the devices can be passed on to be used for the next group of people, and that helps return something for our bottom line on top of the fundamental focus, which is the data security.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: So thank you. That's really helpful to hear insights about data security and all the additional benefits from upcycling. But I know you also believe that the partnership you have with the vendor you choose is super important as well and became particularly so during the COVID crisis. Can you tell us more about that?</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: Certainly. So we had a bit of a problem where the U.K. went into lockdown. Everybody had to stay home. But by the same token, we're still a financial services organization, and we've got to look after the data and the equipment that we have in our possession. So once we're in lockdown, we realized that if anybody was to leave the organization, we couldn't get the device back in the same secure fashion that we normally would. Because we've built up the partnership with HPFS, we got in touch with our account team and said, \"Can you please help us here? We're not quite sure how we're going to achieve this, but we've got this problem. Can you help us find a solution for it?\"</p><p>I'm really pleased to say that the account team were phenomenal. They turned around not only a new process, but also, more surprisingly, a change in contract within around 24 hours. And anyone who's gone through that contracting process can often realize that contracting didn't normally take 1 to 24 hours in any organization. So not only to have that new contract in place, but to give us that confidence that our devices were being picked up, securely wiped and then returned to us, so that we could reuse them for the next user because we try and make sure we maximize the investment in any equipment.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Well, Debbie, thank you. It's been a tremendous pleasure speaking with you today, and great to hear the insights and experiences you've had about deploying IT asset upcycling. Thank you again.</p><p>DEBBIE HUBBARD: Thank you.</p><p>JENNIFER MARINARO: Irv, back to you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: Thank you, Debbie, and thanks, Jenny. This story brings to light two simple and universal truths about technology. One, there is a lot of technology, more and more tech everywhere. And there is a cost to it. If you manage an IT budget, you know this better than anyone. Data center equipment for one is a significant investment, $157 million on average for a typical U.S. data center. And, two, a lot of that technology is sitting idle or aging. Research has shown that on average, around 30% of servers in large data centers are sitting idle, unused or underutilized, but still draining power. This translates into at least $30 billion in wasted data center capital around the world every year.</p><p>Now bringing these two truths together and you have the ingredients for a recipe that will serve both your business goals and have a positive impact on sustainability. With programs such as HPE asset upcycling that Debbie Hubbard described or with the move to as a service models, where technology comes back to us, we've taken in over 8 million assets in our technology renewal centers over just the last 2 years. 90% of these get reused. We find them a new home. Close to 10% gets recycled, and only a fraction becomes e-waste. And to be clear, we take in practically any technology no matter the vendor or life cycle stage. Of the data center tech we do take in, about 40% is HPE. And when it comes to workplace devices, about 80% is HPE Inc. The rest, literally any other vendor you can name. So for you, think of the possibilities for your entire IT estate, from your data centers to the edge, to your end users' workplace devices, even some 3D printers.</p><p>And when you take this deliberate path toward a more sustainable and circular IT, your choices lead to significant e-waste avoidance. With HPFS and 90% technology reuse, you can reduce environmental impact in considerable proportions. For just this last year, the CO2 we saved is equivalent to the average emission of 37,000 cars. And the waste kept from landfills could pile up to 434,000 moving boxes. And when upcycling and reuse are simply not possible, recycling in a secure, environmentally responsible way is the best option.</p><p>Last year, in our technology renewal centers, the equivalent of 120 million plastic bottles was recycled, and the list simply goes on and on. All this is thanks to your decision to reimagine your IT estate. The technology we take in from you and refurbish is often sold as pre-owned to other customers who need it. There's been a big uptick in pre-owned technology this year. As the pandemic spread, HPE Financial Services' essential personnel worked tirelessly to ship tens of thousands of pre-owned PCs and data center gear to hospitals, government agencies, banks, educational facilities and other businesses who urgently needed technology.</p><p>This was done to equip employees and their families working and learning from home or to make online food ordering possible or to keep a hospital running and save patients' lives. But this trend for preowned started way before. It's a profound shift toward a wiser use of IT budgets and more market circularity.</p><p>Now recently, we connected with our partner, WWD, and one of their customers, Boys Hope Girls Hope. And I believe Kristin Ostby even braved the tropical storm in Guatemala to make this video. So I'm very grateful. Why don't we hear their thoughts on pre-owned technology?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: Thank you. It's a great story and an inspiration to all of us, and we're so glad to be a part of it. And on that note, I have to say a special thank you to our partner community, who is doing an incredible job helping customers achieve their goals and solve their most pressing problems. Boys Hope Girls Hope is aligning budget to priorities without coming up short on efficiency. Nationwide is reimagining what it can do with their current IT assets to create more sustainability and infuse some vitality in their budget looking forward.</p><p>You too may be looking at the possibilities to optimize and leverage your tech estate. Our teams of experts in both technology, asset management and financing are here to help you with that. Today, more than ever, you need a partner that can combine the financial acumen of a CFO with the technology insights of a CIO, so you can create a dynamic, sustainable IT investment strategy that works for you.</p><p>Over the course of the last 4 years, we've put over $1.3 billion back into our customers' budgets with our HPE asset upcycling and accelerated migration solutions.</p><p>In the case of Liberty Mutual, their approach has helped them accelerate their transformation and move to as a service with HPE GreenLake. Let's hear about this now from Chris Lund at Liberty Mutual.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: If you want to hear more about Chris' story, I encourage you to join the discover session with our COO, Gerri Gold.</p><p>And we know your challenges are many as IT leaders. Sometimes your most pressing needs are just keeping the lights on and the business running. And surely, it's been a tough start to 2020. And that's why in early April, I approved the allocation of $2 billion to help you. This includes a suite of programs, including technology buybacks and rentals to help alleviate your financial constraints. We also offer a 2020 payment relief program where you can acquire the technology you need today and pay only 1% of the total contract value each month in 2020, thereby deferring over 90% of the cost until 2021. Our objective is simple. It's to help you avoid freezing projects that you deem important for the near or long-term future of your company.</p><p>And speaking of the future, I'd like to welcome someone with a vision as to where we're heading and what will make a difference tomorrow, technology analyst, Jeremiah Owyang. Jeremiah has perfected the concept of work from anywhere, as you'll see.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: Jeremiah, welcome. You do have a unique working setup. Can you tell us about it?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG, INDUSTRY ANALYST &amp; FOUNDING PARTNER, KALEIDO INSIGHTS: Yes, welcome to the Tiny Airstream Studios in the heart of Silicon Valley. Rent is very expensive around here, and I actually did an economic calculation. I could just afford an Airstream for a small monthly fee. And it made a lot of sense for economic reasons. Not only is it an asset, which I could resell at a great valuator, but it's something that I can quickly just pay on a monthly basis. Secondly, it's great for the environment. It's just 29 steps from my house. And then the most important thing is my customers love to come out and hang out. It's a great experience for all of us.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: That certainly sounds nice, Jeremiah. As a technology analyst, how do you think business leaders should anticipate what's coming next in this fast-changing world?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: Yes. Unfortunately, times look like they're going through a really tough time. And I think it's going to be challenging going forward. Not only do we have a climate crisis to contend with, but the economy is up and down, political strife. And then on top of that, we're in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p>Now that's a lot to take in, but the important thing to think about is, what will our customers do? They could radically shift directions, and we might be stuck in the lurch, not even connected.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: So what should business leaders do then?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: Well, I have some good news. We can really focus on a mindset, shifting from being fragile to actually being agile. So a fragile business is one that doesn't change. And when it does, it goes very slow. And when it hits an immovable object, it could actually shatter. That doesn't sound fun. Instead, we should actually have an agile business, a company that's constantly changing. And when it does, it does so very quickly. And more importantly, it grows during times of change rather than shatters. So we have to shift from fragility towards agility.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: And can you give us an example we can relate to?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: Absolutely. We all love forests. But did you know that the trees are actually interconnected like a network under the ground using a network of fungi? You've heard of the worldwide web, but this is actually called the wood wide web. And the fungi are sharing nutrients from tree to tree. It's an ecosystem that enables agility for all of those creatures.</p><p>Now this applies to your own company as well. Rather than think of your own company as a stand-alone tree, we're actually connected to an ecosystem of buyers and sellers of assets, talent, data, hardware and everything that we need. We're not in isolation. When we're actually connected to the ecosystem, our company can be more agile.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: So staying on the economics conversation, what question should businesses be thinking about?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: We should think of our companies like an agile start-up. Start-ups are shy of having too many assets which become liabilities. Instead, they think about, how can we make everything be on demand or like a utility? This could be from the actual physical real estate to hardware, networking gear, talent and even data. And the opportunity is to quickly onboard these items. Sometimes preowned makes a lot of sense. And then when it's time to change the business, whether it's shrinking it or growing it, we can quickly have those assets sold to the ecosystem and upcycle it and then bring in new assets. Our company's actually agile. And of course, this is great for all of us. We can sleep better at night knowing that our company will be agile during times of great change.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: So Jeremiah, what's the most exciting prediction you have?</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: In our research, we found that companies are becoming more digitally connected to their ecosystem of partners, manufacturers, customers and beyond. This means that the amount of information flowing and assets between them is moving at a rapid pace. And it's actually very difficult in the future to tell the difference between your own customers and employees. They start to look like one unified body. And when you hit this level of maturity, it means that your company is a core part of this ecosystem connected in a very agile way, and that means your company will be resilient and can survive any change that comes.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: Thanks so much for these insights, Jeremiah.</p><p>JEREMIAH OWYANG: Thanks for having me, everybody.</p><p>IRVING H. ROTHMAN: Well, I think it's fair to say that transformation is not an option. Profound shifts are underway now, and only the digitally fit will thrive. So CFOs, our suggestion is don't cut IT blindly. Your company can and must transform. We think you should work with your CIO and IT leaders instead, so you can create financial vitality from your technology, and you can contribute to a more sustainable IT.</p><p>And bring us in. Let's get creative together and use today's challenges as an opportunity to reimagine and optimize your technology estate. And whether we're talking about from edge-to-cloud to end user, wherever your workplaces may be, this will be for the good of your company and the betterment of the planet.</p><p>A few months back, we received a special award presented to us by HPE's CEO, Antonio Neri. It was the Force for Good award in recognition of all HPFS is doing for circular economy. We know that we owe this award to the choices you make around your IT and sustainability. Because you are helping build something that is more dynamic, more agile and sustainable. So we all have an opportunity to improve for the better.</p><p>Now let me close by thanking all of you for joining us, and we leave you with this message from our team.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So the digital transformation of edge-to-cloud is creating data at an unprecedented pace, and all of that data, it creates challenges for companies who need to store, access and analyze it. The solution, a data fabric. I'm joined here by Ted Dunning. He's the Chief Technologist, Data Fabric, at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Ted, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: I just want to start by establishing what exactly a data fabric is. It's a term that's been in use for a couple of years, but define it for us.</p><p>TED DUNNING, DATA FABRIC TECHNOLOGIST, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Yes. It's a term that's evolving a little bit. And rather than talk about exactly what it is, I prefer to talk about what a data fabric does. And what a data fabric does is it enables you to run the right programs at the right time, in the right place with the right data. That used to be easy when there was one thing to do with one kind of data in one place. But people's business doesn't happen in a data center anymore. Instead, it happens wherever they touch their customers, and that can be all over the place. And it can be time-critical as well, and there's lots of programs that need to touch that data. And that's made this job of running things in the right time, place and so on much, much harder. And a data fabric is what solves that problem.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, with the digital transformation, enterprise data is increasing by an estimated 40% per year. Thinking about legacy IT systems, how can they keep up? And how does the data fabric help?</p><p>TED DUNNING: Well, that's exactly the point. Legacy data systems don't keep up. There's a couple of assumptions that they're based on that are basically incompatible with the highly variable, fast-growing world that we have. And to make it all worse, IT budgets are not growing at that comparable rate. And so people have to do, with essentially the same level of resources, a job that's growing bit by bit, or many bits at a time even, and that's hard. Now the data fabric is changing some of the rules of the game, things that we thought were set in stone.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So how does a data fabric actually make the collection of data easier?</p><p>TED DUNNING: One of the cool things it does is it lets people focus on a singular part of the overall business task. So if we're talking about telemetry, that's one sample application, which many people use, it's possible then for the person building the data, making the data, recording the data to focus purely on the recording task, on inserting the data into a stream. It's possible then for the person analyzing the data to look at a single stream, a single data source and see the entire world in a drop of data. They each can focus purely on their own task of data origination or data analysis. And the third person, the person administrating the system, can worry about geography. This is a separation of concerns. The old ways of doing things tend to have people worry about everything all the time. And if everyone does that, it leads to a real problem, productivity. If, on the other hand, we allow people to focus on the key parts of the task that they're good at, then we can make these problems much, much easier to solve.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: In terms of solving those problems, give us an idea of the biggest effect that a data fabric could have on an enterprise.</p><p>TED DUNNING: There are a couple of major effects. One is that we can break down geography. Another is we can surpass elements of scale that have defeated us in the past. That could be in terms of number of bytes, but it can also be in terms of the number of objects. And then thirdly, it helps us have more multi-tenancy. And the essence of multi-tenancy is what happened at one of our customers a couple of years ago where 2 people sat down at lunch time, one lamenting, \"If only we had this data, I could do X.\" The other responding, \"We do have that data because I was doing something else.\" Now because they were able to work together on the same data fabric, because that data fabric supported that multi-tenancy, they were able to prototype over the next few days a feature of an entire business practice that, that customer has attributed to causing an incremental $1 billion, with a B, in incremental revenue.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: How do you see the space evolving moving forward, if you think just 10 years down the line?</p><p>TED DUNNING: Yes. No, that's incredibly dangerous and really, really hard for a technologist to do. But 10 years ago, we had an idea, and the idea was to build something that people could share, that could scale, that could provide this geographical distribution. And that vision, I think, was pretty much on target. And I think we're going to have a lot more of the same, but we're also going to turn the entire Internet upside down.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: What exactly does that mean for the average Internet user?</p><p>TED DUNNING: The design of the Internet has been all about a few large sources of information, pushing it to millions and billions of consumers. But we're seeing an inversion of that where we have gazillions, and that's a technical term, of data sources that are driving data to a few large aggregation points, well, actually, many of them but not as many as data sources by a long shot, and then turning that data inside out and driving it back toward consumers for benefit of various kinds. That might mean something as prosaic as better manufacturing, but it can also mean real effect on our daily lives as well.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Who's generating the most data? Where is this data coming from?</p><p>TED DUNNING: The customers that I've seen who, you might say, have gone from 0 to 60 faster than anybody you might imagine is, interestingly enough, the automotive industry. They're developing autonomous vehicles, and to have those vehicles behave safely in the real world, you have to sample the real world. You have to see what things really look like. And these companies are acquiring data at a rate of gigabytes per second per test vehicle, and there could be hundreds of them. That leads to petabytes per day and hundreds and hundreds of petabytes, even exabytes, of retained data that has to be analyzed well, and moving that data from the cars to the core is difficult. But the goal eventually is to have these cars run safely and to acquire more data when something is novel and interesting.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Ted, it's been a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much, and thanks for joining our Hewlett Packard Enterprise Discover Virtual Experience. I'm Tim Stenovec.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Data is growing at this staggering speed. How do we take all of that data and make it work for us? What kind of computing power do we need? Here to tell us is Peter Ungaro, General Manager of High-Performance Computing and Mission-Critical Solutions at HPE. Peter, thanks so much for being here. It's great to see you.</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO, GENERAL MANAGER OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) &amp; MISSION CRITICAL SOLUTIONS (MCS), HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: Good. Thanks, Tim. Glad to be here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: I think for a lot of people, it's a challenge to really wrap our heads just around the concept of exascale. How powerful is an exascale computer?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: Yes. In supercomputing, we really try and look at the physical world and recreate it digitally. And exascale is just the way to think about a performance level of a supercomputer. So it's actually measures of floating point operations of the system, and exa is a quintillion or 1 billion, billion floating point operations per second. That's like one with 18 zeros behind it. So it's a huge number. I mean to give you a perspective, Tim, the entire galaxy of the Milky Way is about 1 billion, billion miles wide.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: So it's a huge, huge figure. What can we do with supercomputers that are that powerful?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: In supercomputing, as we do a model or a simulation of the physical world, we're trying to make it more and more accurate. And so the more capability, the more power that we are able to have, the larger the model that we can do, we can add in more science or more physics into the model to really try and represent it as accurately as we possibly can. So it just gives us a capability to do that with larger and larger problems faster and faster.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Well, we're certainly not carrying around supercomputers in our pockets, at least not yet. But how does supercomputing impact daily life? What are some of the applications of the technology?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: Every day, we drive our cars, and one of the things that we do with supercomputers is we look at crash testing vehicles. So we try to identify how to make these vehicles safer and safer in an auto accident. The thing that we can do as we start to scale this up is we can not only model a car within a supercomputer crashing maybe against the wall or against another vehicle, but we can start to model human beings inside the car, a baby in a chair in the backseat of the car with working organs and such and really understand how the human body interacts with the vehicle upon impact to make the vehicle safer and improve our -- safety of our lives.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: I understand that HPE has a relationship with the Department of Energy and the national labs. Take us into that relationship. I know that they've bought a number of these exascale-class systems, right?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: Yes, that's right. The Department of Energy is one of the largest users of supercomputers in the world today, and we have a long, very collaborative relationship with the Department of Energy, which is very exciting and very important relationship with us, because we actually do co-development on new machines. They tell us what their applications and what their needs are, and we're able to understand that and build supercomputers that really enable that. So that's a really big partnership for us overall. In fact, when you talk about exascale, the first 3 exascale supercomputers in the world are going to the Department of Energy, and we're super proud at HPE that they selected us for all 3 of those.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: You really sound like the type of person who thinks a lot about the future. Now as the speed of supercomputing continues to get faster and faster, what else becomes possible? What does the world look like in a decade, in 20 years, beyond?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: One thing we all agree on is that data continues to grow. And wherever that data is -- any company, small and large, they're dealing with just a huge growth of data overall. And so what that means is in order to do supercomputing with that data or to do modeling of that data, or to do analysis to get some business insight from that data, we have to compute on it. And so the models get larger and larger. And we have new technologies, new ways to compute on these models with new algorithms like artificial intelligence and machine learning. And so I really believe that these supercomputing technologies are going to become more and more important. And I think, really, as we go out and think about it in the future, virtually all corporations of larger size, the Global 2000 and companies like that, will have supercomputing technology in it. And they'll be needed to do these next generation of really digital transformations that these companies are going through and do this advanced modeling. So pretty much, I think, supercomputers will become very pervasive in the future and be used across a variety of different analytics and scientific applications.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: How does an exascale technology that's used in these labs, that's used by the Department of Energy, how does that then translate to use in commercial business?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: One of the things that we're very excited about is that we're building -- is we're building like these large exascale supercomputers. And just to give you a perspective, the 3 systems that I mentioned before, if you added them all up, that's more powerful today than the entire top 500 fastest supercomputers in the world of today. So just to give you a perspective of that. But what we see is that those technologies that we develop for those machines, we like to call them Exascale Era technologies, these technologies are going to be delivered to companies in much smaller sizes. So a national laboratory that's buying an exascale computer, think of it that they may have 100 cabinets that are like refrigerator-sized cabinets that have -- packed full of processors and interconnect chips and software technologies to make them work together. We'll take that same technology in a much smaller scale, maybe a cabinet or 2, or maybe in a smaller business, even a server or 2. And that's what's really exciting, is taking these technologies from the extreme scale and bringing it down to be able to be used by all corporations to handle their massive growth of data and their digital transformation.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: What's the application of this technology that excites you the most?</p><p>PETER J. UNGARO: None is more interesting than what's going on right now with COVID-19. I mean one of the exciting pieces about being part of the supercomputer industry is just seeing what these amazing scientists and engineers do with our systems, and I think there's no better time to see that with -- than right now with COVID-19. And we see a number of researchers using our systems to help to find a therapy, a cure for COVID-19. So it's really exciting to see people leveraging these supercomputers and trying to solve a problem that's affecting all of us around the world today.</p><p>TIM STENOVEC: Yes. We're watching the solution happen in real time. Fascinating stuff, Peter. Thank you so much for joining me, and thanks so much for watching.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, hello, and a very warm welcome to the HPE Discover Virtual Experience. I'm Daisy McAndrew with today's headlines. And it's here where we will recap the key announcements, offer insights into how the news made at Discover today will benefit customers and differentiate HPE in the marketplace. Well, today has been, of course, all about how HPE is accelerating recovery and transforming our future. And I'm thrilled to be joined by Hewlett Packard Enterprises' Jason Newton, and back again with me is also Sally Eaves. Thank you both so much for being here on what is certainly a big day. There's always such a buzz, isn't there, around day 1 at Discover.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Jason, I want to start by looking at it from HPE's perspective, what did you make of this new format, virtual format?</p><p>JASON NEWTON, VP OF X-HPE MARKETING &amp; MESSAGING, HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY: I really loved it. I thought it came together beautifully. It really felt interpersonal, getting to know Keith White; of course, Antonio and his guests, the energy of all the guests and the celebrities really came through well for me on the screen. I thought John Chambers was an absolute treasure. Simone Biles was a breath of fresh air. It really enabled us to help our story and demonstrate to the market just how rapidly Antonio Neri is transforming HPE.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Sally, this is a whole new way of doing things, isn't it?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I, first of all, echo the subject of energy. I absolutely love that. For me, massively important, the passion really came to the fore. And some of the stories that were brought to the fore weren't just about digital transformation for business, it was also about wider purpose transformation for society as well and building that shared value. That, for me, massively important. So tech for good and tech for business, hand-in-hand. That was massively -- it's embedded in the entire keynote throughout a lot of day 1. So really impressive of the whole leadership there.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Sally, you just mentioned the keynote. And of course, the day kicked off with the always much anticipated CEO keynote. Several things stood out during Antonio Neri's remarks. Of course, he spent much of the 45-minute keynote talking about how HP is helping customers. Jason, what was your takeaway on that?</p><p>JASON NEWTON: I think it just really showcased how different HP and unique HPE really is. Of course, we brought the technology to the problems, and we've been doing that for decades. But you really got the value of our people, our expertise there on the ground. When our customers had challenges, we were there to help them physically put those solutions into place. And then, of course, the financial flexibility in a time where cash flow was at a premium. So I think it really showcased the unique ingredients that Hewlett Packard Enterprise can bring to bear to solve not only these immediate needs of the COVID-19 crisis but also the transformation needs going forward.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Sally, it's such an extraordinary time to be having to make such an important speech. It's such a big moment in history, not just for tech, but for the world.</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Echoing that point on finance, actually, I've been really impressed by everything around it. We're here to help, it's not just a motto. It's been something that's substantiated. There's been true action around that. I've been involved in HPC consortium. We've seen examples around that. And it's been really important here with financial flexibility alongside tech has made a massive difference. Lots of businesses, if you didn't have that flexibility, they couldn't defer payment, they wouldn't have been able to carry on. And we see a lot of real-world examples how businesses have been able to carry on, but also in education, lots of different sectors. So that real tech human partnership, it has to be leadership and organization that cares. And again, throughout day 1, in the heart, the people, the purpose behind the tech has really shown. So I've been really impressed by that.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And there were some meaty announcements in that speech. We heard Antonio underscore how HP is committed to being the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service company. And his goal, he says, is to have everything as a service by 2022. Jason, why is that so crucial now?</p><p>JASON NEWTON: Well, it's crucial now because that's what customers are telling us more and more. That's exactly what they want. They want to focus on their business and their customers and their outcomes and their digital transformation strategy. They don't want to deal with the technology that's underneath of that. And ultimately, what the edge-to-cloud platform strategy is all about is about data. Customers are -- have massive amounts of data, but most of that data goes unused, and it can't be acted on in the time -- in the right place and the right time in order to create value. So what an edge-to-cloud platform does is it brings all of the collection, the connecting, the protecting, the analyzing of all of the data at all of the edges and connects it with the power of the cloud and their applications in their data center. And that's ultimately the ultimate aim that we're going for to help customers unleash the value of all of that data with that platform.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And it wasn't just Antonio we heard from. Of course, we also heard from HPE's Financial Services, Irv Rothman, on financial flexibility and what's available. Now HPE is talking today about how it's here to help companies rebuild and modernize. Sally, I imagine that flexibility is crucial for businesses at the moment.</p><p>SALLY EAVES: It's absolutely vital and that -- if there hadn't been that over this period of time, and everybody is dealing with different types demand or lapse in demand, depending on what you're looking at, the personal context matters and knowing that you've got trust and support and you can defer payments or you can have the new consumption models where you pay for what you use, it massively helps. But also investment for the future. We've seen how vital digital transformation is, the businesses of all sizes of all types in all sectors. So these are some really interesting developments around consumption. And that also we had a release investment from your existing estate and use that to kind of fuel your innovation going forward. So again, this flexibility and the agility to adapt and grow, not have to do everything upfront, that's massively important, particularly for SMEs and never more so than at this time. And we've seen a massive acceleration of innovation actually over the COVID-19 experience in certain areas, particularly research, that we've seen. And I think we can use that as an example and a tipping point in many other sectors as well. And this financial backing, tech, finance people that all has to come together, and we've seen some exciting announcements about that today.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Jason, that flexibility is also all about the relationships, isn't it, and the collaborations and the partnerships?</p><p>JASON NEWTON: Yes, absolutely. I think what Irv and his team do a great job is they really establish a more of a long-term relationship with that customer. And they look at their asset strategy, their financial strategy and their business strategy holistically over the long term. This isn't a leasing business. This is a financial partnership business to really help them maximize all of the assets that they have and repurpose them and transform them in a sustainable way to help the business grow.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Sally, we heard this phrase being discussed today, that today is the age of insights. Antonio Neri said the age of insights has replaced the information age, and he talked about the next wave of digital transformation. What did you make of that?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Absolutely. I love this. So something echoes, something that I would like to give out as we speak. So I talked about the 3 Vs, the velocity, the volume, veracity of data. And in the past, we've had this information age. It's all been about the volume, the quantity of data, that sometimes, the nuances, the insights from that have got lost. And particularly with things like 5G becoming more mainstream, that will only grow. So we need to be in a new era now, and that's what Antonio was stressing, is age of insights where we're looking for enabling insights for action, informed action that can make a difference, both in our businesses and the wider society as well. And he was also talking about the move towards highly decentralized and distributed models and shifting away from this highly centralized approach to large data centers. And in the future, we're going to more smaller data everywhere.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Well, I want to talk a little bit more about some of the big product announcements, HPE GreenLake Cloud Services and the new software business, HPE Ezmeral. Jason, what should customers take away from those announcements? What do they mean?</p><p>JASON NEWTON: Antonio made a promise last year that we were known as a product company, we're going to become a services company and a software company. And I think he delivered on that in spades today with the announcements. They weren't products. They were actually cloud services. The way that Keith White and team, and if you saw the demo, it really brought it to life just how simple, point-and-click, just a complete cloud experience. But it's a cloud experience that comes to you in your environment, in your edge, in your data center. So I think it's really unique. And I think that the conversation right now is about distributed clouds, and I think GreenLake squarely put themselves in that conversation today as an alternative for customers who need that agility and that intelligence where their applications live. And then secondly, we saw the announcement of Ezmeral, our new software portfolio and brand, new container platform and machine learning operations platform that are really aimed at bringing that DevOps agility to the machine learning workflow. So pretty big, monumental and, again, another example of how rapidly Antonio is transforming HPE.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Sally?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: The personalization aspect of this was really important in 2 specific areas. So one was speed and agility. I thought the 14-day delivery offer was really exciting, that consistency of end-to-end services. So you've got that visibility around governance, around compliance, around all the things that you described around edge-to-cloud, but also the ability to adapt and grow with you. You don't have to do everything straight away. There's a lot of talk around how you could build new excellent infrastructure, for example. And also the ability to reuse licenses. I love the fact there's no lock-in. There's no data egress costs. I think that's a real differentiator, actually, in the market, so that was really, really good to see. So again, it's all being about partnership, not just from the tech, but also about how you can access it and how that's relevant for you and can grow with you and depending on your context. I also love that point around machine learning as well. I think there can be a real opportunity here to really add value from AI projects. And sometimes, in the past, we've seen how they can get stuck at different stages within the journey. I really think that will be a differentiator in this particular area.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: And Antonio didn't only talk about HPE, did he? I thought it was really interesting to see him take on the competition. He mentioned AWS, Google Cloud Services, Microsoft and Oracle by name, saying that the new HPE GreenLake Cloud Services will bring agility and workloads to locations that competitors don't. Sally, how is HPE positioned in that space? And were you surprised to hear him really take the fight to the competition?</p><p>SALLY EAVES: Yes. Yes. It was a real kind of leadership moment, wasn't it? It was a real standing-on positioning, which I thought was really exciting. And kind of -- I mentioned, I think kind of the key areas there, it wasn't just the tech, it was around the finance and around the access and the ability to personalize to your business content. It was something for all different sizes of business to grow and develop with you on your journey. So I love that. But in particular, the differentiation around things like licenses, not having those additional costs around data egress, for example, no lock-ins. That is a big, big standpoint, but then everything around the end-to-end, seamless platform-as-a-service experience was very, very impressive.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: Okay. Jason, well, I think we've pretty much covered the headlines today. What do you think is in-store for day 2?</p><p>JASON NEWTON: Well, it's another action-packed day tomorrow. We're going kick off the day with Keerti Melkote, our President of the Aruba Group. He'll be sharing the latest innovations from Aruba and our cloud-first ESP network that they announced a few weeks ago. Then Soledad O'Brien is going to join us, and she'll be hosting our Women Leaders in Technology event with some special guests and surprises there, and then really good, rich conversation that will be happening in that session. And then we'll end the day -- today, we ended the day with Performing Under Pressure with Simone Biles and Lewis Hamilton and others. Tomorrow, we're going to be speaking to the team leads and the principals and presidents of those different organizations, and they're going to be discussing the business of sports and how that's going to change as we go forward, and how technology and data are going to intersect the sports experience. So it's going to be an exciting day.</p><p>DAISY MCANDREW: A lot to look forward to tomorrow. But for now, for me, I just want to say a very big thank you to Jason Newton and Sally Eaves for giving me and you so much insights and perspective. And that just about does it for me today. I'll be back tomorrow with my colleague, Tim Stenovec, for a preview of Keerti Melkote's spotlight session on intelligent edge. We'll have a live session on Women Leaders in Technology as well as a deep dive into HPE's approach towards diversity and inclusion with its Chief Talent Officer. But until then, do spend some time getting the most out of your HPE Discover Virtual Experience. I promise, it will be worth it. I'm Daisy McAndrew, and I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

IBD's Internet &amp; Technology staff chose these:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">** 1. Hewlett-Packard buys Compaq Computer. Way back on Labor Day weekend 2001 came word of HP's intent to buy its rival Compaq, the biggest merger ever of computer companies. The action occurred mostly in 2002, as CEO Carly Fiorina and top executives fought for shareholder approval of the $19 billion merger. And what a proxy fight it turned out to be. Company director Walter Hewlett, son of the company's legendary co-founder, came out of nowhere to lead the opposition. His key allies included David Packard Jr., son of the company's other legendary co-founder. With Fiorina and top executives lobbying big shareholders right up to the day of the vote, the pro-merger group eked out a win by a 3% margin. Now the question is: Can the huge merger work? So far, so good, but the upshot might be on top 10 lists for 2003.</p><p>** 2. Microsoft settlement. Talk about way back. This story began Oct. 20, 1997, when the U.S. Justice Department sued Microsoft for antitrust. It ended -- well, sort of -- on Nov. 1. That's when a U.S. District Court judge affirmed most of a settlement that Justice and the company reached in November 2001. Contrary to an earlier judge's ruling, that settlement does not include the drastic measure of forcing Microsoft to split into two companies. It does force the company to \"open up\" in many ways. For instance, it should be easier for rivals to get their icons on PC screens. A new judge had to make this November's ruling because nine states and the District of Columbia had opposed the pact reached in November 2001. Most of the states agreed with the latest decision, but Massachusetts and West Virginia plan to appeal.</p><p>** 3. Tech stocks, venture capital investing and IT spending falter. Downtrodden. It's a dull word. But it fits \"tech\" and \"spending\" in 2002. People and companies weren't spending much money on tech in 2002. The numbers tell the story, and they ain't pretty. To take one stock example, IBD's 55-company computer networking group fell about 50% this year. Analysts say U.S. spending on information technology will fall 2% to 3% this year, to about $340 billion. And that's an improvement. IT spending fell 10% or so in 2001 after rising at an average of more than 10% a year for the 10 preceding years. Third-quarter venture capital funding fell 48% from the year-earlier period to $4.5 billion, says a quarterly survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association. Only 159 companies received venture capital funding in the third quarter, the lowest number in seven years. Observers expect $20 billion in total venture capital investment in 2002, vs. $107 billion in 2000.</p><p>** 4. WorldCom bankruptcy. Nearly all telecom carriers far overspent during the Internet bubble years, and most have courted trouble since late 2000 -- especially WorldCom. As regulators investigated its accounting, CEO Bernard Ebbers resigned on May 1. Then, on July 21, the pride of Jackson, Miss., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. It admitted to improper accounting of $4 billion in expenses, and later upped that figure a few billion. The firm, which listed $30 billion in debt when it filed, plans to emerge from Chapter 11 this year.</p><p>** 5. Comcast No. 1. December 2001 marked the announcement that Comcast would buy AT&amp;T Broadband, the cable company known as Tele-Communications Inc. before AT&amp;T bought it in 1999. On Nov. 18, the deal was completed, creating a company formally called AT&amp;T Comcast Corp. It serves more than 21 million subscribers in 41 states, making it almost double the size of No. 2 Time Warner Cable. Now Comcast, with AT&amp;T's former CEO Michael Armstrong as chairman, will see if it can make investments in digital cable and telephony pay off while holding off other cable companies and satellite TV firms in the basic cable arena.</p><p>** 6. E-commerce successes. Dot-bombs and the bursting Internet bubble are a big part of the malaise affecting tech and the economy. But, hey, not ALL the news is bad. In 2002, e-travel emerged as a big business, led by Expedia, Travelocity and airline-owned Orbitz. Also in the year, Amazon.com, the largest e-tailer, recorded its first quarterly profit ever. Yes, it went back in the red the next quarter, but why quibble? And perhaps the Web's biggest success to date, eBay, kept on rolling. From 1998 through 2001, the company's per-share profit went from 3 cents to 7 cents to 21 cents to 49 cents. The fact is, millions of more people are using the Web to buy goods and services each year.</p><p>** 7. Security push. The increase in all forms of security following 9-11 gathered steam in 2002 amid the war on terror. The plan is to cope with acronyms such as NBC and WMD -- nuclear biological chemical and weapons of mass destruction. Government, industry and John Q. Public took a hard look at security risks, both physical and cyber. Troops moved against al-Qaida and to prep for a possible war with Iraq. Airport screening became government work. Laws got tougher to fight terror. The Department of Homeland Security blends 22 agencies to fight terror on home soil. Tech sectors that deal with security look for a boost from the safety push.</p><p>** 8. Tech consulting shift. This trend story began about two years ago. Then, when you spoke of the really big tech consulting companies, you referred to the services portion of the Big Five accounting firms, along with IBM, Electronic Data Systems, Computer Sciences and maybe Fujitsu. But by the late 1990s the Big Five, prodded by corporate governance types, saw that -- hmmm -- tech consulting and auditing might bring up conflicts. So the great split-up was on. KCIN changed its name to BearingPoint and trades under BE. IBM bought PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting after Hewlett-Packard dropped its earlier bid. EDS in September said the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into how the company accounted for employee stock options. Coupled with an earnings warning, EDS shares lost three-quarters of their value in less than a month. Meanwhile, Deloitte Consulting partners planned to soon buy out their business from parent Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Keep your score card handy.</p><p>** 9. Wireless advances. They're wild about Wi-Fi. That sums up how many tech companies feel about the short-range wireless fidelity systems that became all the rage in 2002. Wi-Fi offers wireless Internet access to those located near Wi-Fi \"nodes.\" Such nodes are being installed quickly in airports, coffee shops, residential buildings and other gathering places. Wi-Fi systems share radio spectrum within 500 feet of radio antennas. The biggest users are laptop computer owners, but Wi-Fi could spread to handhelds and mobile phones. Intel, IBM, Dell, AT&amp;T, Sony and others jumped on the Wi-Fi bandwagon in 2002. But if Wi-Fi spreads, that could throw a wrench into plans of mobile phone companies to deploy next-generation 3G networks. In 2002, carriers like Sprint PCS and Verizon upgraded a notch to 2.5G networks that offered more voice capacity and faster data speeds. And 3G systems, five times faster than 2.5G networks, would whisk short movie files and pictures to mobile phones. In Europe, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. is the first to press ahead with 3G.</p><p>** 10. Online copyright/piracy issues. If you go to the Web sites of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America, what issue do you think dominates their home pages? Piracy, copyright protection, the need for laws to stop the unauthorized redistribution of records, movies, DVDs, etc. You can also find tons of rival sites for groups on the other side of the debate. Perhaps the event that crystallized the issue in 2002 was the final demise of Napster, the first popular Web site for the -- free -- downloading of music. Cut down by earlier court rulings and unable to complete a sale to Bertelsmann, it finally shut down in September. And what happened? Not much. Many of the Napster users had long ago switched to other peer-to-peer sites, such as Kazaa, that let users freely share and trade recordings. (Record producers like Sony and EMI launched for-fee sites in late 2001 and 2002, but they aren't faring too well.) All kinds of legislating, lobbying and legal issues continue on both sides.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-604531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:47KG-RGY0-01J8-W4GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1441\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>January 2, 2003 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HPQ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

Companies like Facebook and Google, which have been amassing user data through the Internet boom now have to provide European citizens access to the data they store. Many companies have adopted this regulation for their users globally. </p><p>Google has a globally accessible takeout service and Facebook allows users to export their data from their settings.  Many consumers we surveyed actually didn't know about the existence of these features.  The hey.ai team has leveraged this regulation to build an analytics service to help users analyze their data. The raw data dumps these platforms provide are typically in JSON/CSV/HTML format and often difficult to make sense of. Hey.ai's platform crawls through the raw data, and provides easy to understand insights.      \"Thus far, our average user has over 500MB of Facebook data, and over 10GB of Google data. We knew that the last ten years has been a rocketship for data creation, and GDPR regulations finally created an opportunity for consumers to fully understand what's in their data.\"     Hari Rajagopalan.  Apple introduced Screen Time usage with iOS12 and Instagram introduced a new feature to help users see when they've reached the end of their feed. Digital health is becoming a priority for both big tech companies and consumers. Hey.ai is taking digital health one step further with detailed analytics and insights of interactions and content on platforms.  GDPR regulations represent a huge opportunity for startups. The next wave of innovation: AI first products will be data-driven, and this regulation allows startups to compete with existing giants.  Hey.ai found during their beta that the average user had over 500MB of uncompressed Facebook data and over 10GB of uncompressed Google data. After realizing that some of the data files were so large that they caused memory crashes, they decided to build an analytics platform to answer questions about user data. From Hari, founder of hey.ai: \"I realized Facebook had over 10 years of my life events, and I had a lot of questions about myself. I began asking my friends what they wanted to know about their Facebook and Google data, and built an analytics platform to answer those questions.\" Hey.ai now has hundreds of users who have imported their Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Instagram data and discovered interesting insights about themselves.  The team behind hey.ai previously co-founded Chatbase at Google's Area120 incubator. With every new paradigm, analytics is a consistent innovation. GDPR represents a new paradigm, and hey.ai is one of the first services to leverage this change, but they won't be the last. Hey.ai plans on making money by charging users for premium insights and features as well as analytics on premium only networks. They're currently focused on supporting secure, encrypted analy </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN918740520181019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THP-H9B1-J9XT-P47H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 19, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Companies like Facebook\u00a0and Google, which have been amassing user data through\u00a0the Internet boom now have to provide European citizens access to the data they store. Many companies have adopted this regulation for their users globally. Google has a globally accessible\u00a0takeout\u00a0service\u00a0and Facebook\u00a0allows users to\u00a0export\u00a0their data from their settings.

Socialism (of some kind) is espoused by a growing number of Democratic politicians. A Harvard University study found 51 percent of 18- to 29-year-old Americans do not support capitalism. The business bashing is not solely from the political left; Donald Trump has tweet-attacked plenty of companies for offending his populist instincts. Voices demanding higher taxes and tougher regulations grow louder. Echoing the vigorous trust busting of the Progressive era, there are calls to break up Facebook and Google, the increasingly dominant tech platforms, while the titans of Silicon Valley are rebranded as 21st-century robber barons, heirs to what the Progressive president Teddy Roosevelt lambasted as ''malefactors of great wealth.'' </p><p>  Amid so much criticism, who would dare dispute that there is something rotten about the state of corporate America today? Enter Tyler Cowen, an economics professor who has written a determinedly positive book about business that he subtitles ''A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero.'' Cowen did not become one of the world's most-read bloggers on economics without understanding the value of a well-timed contrarian blast. He showed this to great effect in 2011 in a best-selling e-book, ''The Great Stagnation,'' arguing that the rate of increase in median income had slowed since the early 1970s as a direct consequence of a falling rate of innovation in the American economy, which was thus likely to continue to struggle to grow for the foreseeable future. Now he is back ''to speak up for business, to persuade you that it deserves more of your love and less hate.''</p><p>  If you are hoping for a billet-doux to set your heart aflutter, remember that the author is a practitioner of the dismal science; the romance in his love letter is less Harry Met Sally than Demand Meets Supply. Still, there is no shortage of passion from Cowen. His beloved is the source of ''most of the stuff we enjoy and consume'' and gives ''most of us jobs.'' Business may not be the face that launched a thousand ships, but it built them; indeed, he enthuses, without business we would not have ships, trains and cars; electricity, lighting and heating equipment; most of our food supply and lifesaving pharmaceuticals; clothes for our children; telephones and smartphones; books; and access to the world's online information. Cowen also argues, persuasively, that America tops the world in the quality of its corporate management -- if Chinese firms were managed equally well, they would be up to 50 percent more productive. American business is also the leading innovator globally in many areas.</p><p>  So, as Cowen poses in his concluding chapter, ''If business is so good, why is it so disliked?'' He dismisses the familiar complaints made by critics of corporate America: that it is too corrupt and fraudulent to be trusted; that greedy executives are paid too much; that it hurts consumers by wielding too much monopoly power; that cronyism gives it too much influence in Washington; and so on.</p><p>  Some of his defense of business is more nuanced and less certain than his positive headline message suggests. He devotes a chapter to refuting accusations that Big Tech companies are evil, only to confess to worrying about the threat they pose to personal privacy, which he fears will get dramatically worse as facial recognition and voice-recording technologies become ever more ubiquitous. (Still, perhaps business will rescue us even from this, he reassures himself: ''In the future privacy-protecting technologies will outrace privacy-denying ones'' -- well, maybe.) He argues that business should be trusted more, despite so many high-profile scandals, because it is less prone to lying and cheating than governments or nonprofits, or indeed than regular people going about their everyday lives. This could be read not as a ringing endorsement but as damning with faint praise.</p><p>  For Cowen, the real reason business is so unpopular, despite all it does for us, is that we humans tend to anthropomorphize companies, turning corporations ''into people in our minds, and also in our hearts'' (and even writing love letters to them). We take on this illusion, that business really cares about us, ''to make our lives feel bearable and to help us feel more in control.'' Companies play along in this charade, because it pays them to do so, branding themselves with human characteristics like being friendly and listening to our concerns. Inevitably, we feel let down when they turn out instead to be ''abstract, sharklike legal entities devoted to commercial profit.'' In reality, Cowen says, ''we, as consumers or workers, are never really quite as much in control as we might like to think. And thus we are perpetually disappointed in corporations.'' Thus writes a man who knows, deep down, that his love is doomed to be unrequited.</p><p>  Cowen's explanation is not particularly convincing. Nor is his two-part advice for clearing the current atmosphere of distrust. First, the public should accept that business will always fall short of our unreasonably high expectations, and get over it. Second, rather unexpectedly from a member of the famously libertarian and pro-capitalist economics faculty at George Mason University, he wants business to try harder at being socially responsible.</p><p>  In 1970, The New York Times Magazine published an extraordinarily controversial article by Milton Friedman, titled ''The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.'' At the time, this shocked even much of corporate America, never mind the regular New York Times reader. The article was intended to defend business against heavy-handed government regulation, including of prices and wages, that threatened to squeeze dynamism and innovation out of corporate America. Yet over the years, as deregulation and market liberalization spread across America and then the world, Friedman's words were, I believe, twisted by many investors and business leaders into a simplistic justification for doing anything that increased profits -- and their pay packets -- regardless of the consequences for society and the planet.</p><p>  Risking the ire of his colleagues at George Mason, Cowen rejects Friedman's definition, arguing instead that the ''social responsibility of business is to come up with the magic of a vision that will help us trust it more, whether as consumers or workers.'' The great Nobel laureate's article reflected ''significant ideological blinders,'' he says; ''goals other than simple profit maximization often end up boosting both business and social profits.'' For Cowen, business at its best is a ''fundamentally ethical enterprise'' and (preserving his libertarian credentials by citing Ayn Rand in support of it) ''can be a vehicle for the achievement of heroic goals.''</p><p>  This would have been a far better book had Cowen focused more on how to overcome the negative consequences of the spread of the Friedman Doctrine, which I believe has clearly helped socially irresponsible, greedy, unheroic business leaders flourish at the expense of the heroic kind. As a result, the rise of corporate profits to historic highs as a share of America's G.D.P. has been due not just to the much needed productivity improvements and innovations celebrated by Cowen, but also to shortsighted, selfish decisions that have harmed society and heated up the planet.</p><p>  Happily a new generation of more socially responsible business leaders is emerging, like Marc Benioff of Salesforce, the Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya and Indra Nooyi (until recently at the helm of PepsiCo). If only Cowen had shown less unconditional love for corporate America as a whole and instead concentrated on its best bits, and on what needs to be done to ensure that being ethical and heroic becomes business as usual. That ''love letter'' would have left most readers hopeful that there might yet be a Happily Ever After.</p><p>  Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Then you could take off the keyboard, switch it to Android, and use it to as a tablet to read a magazine from Google Play or play a YouTube clip while you kick back on the sofa.</p><p>Alternatively, you could use Windows 8.1 to maintain your work emails and contacts in Outlook, while storing your personal emails and contacts separately in Android.</p><p>Unfortunately for consumers, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smartcompany.com.au/technology/35946-google-pressuring-asus-to-dump-dual-boot-windows-android-hybrid-tablet.html\">according to reports</url> earlier this week, Google has been putting pressure on Asus to kill the Duet. Apparently, it doesn't want Android tablet consumers lured into buying a device that also runs Windows.</p><p>Back in the late 1990s, there were claims Microsoft was putting pressure on PC makers not to make computers preloaded with competitors to Windows, such as BeOS, Desktop Linux or Amiga OS.</p><p>True or not, the claims earned it the ire of many in the tech world. Critics called the behaviour anti-competitive. It also led, in part, to competition regulators launching antitrust investigations.</p><p>It was against the backdrop of such allegations of anti-competitive behaviour that Google began, with the company adopting the corporate slogan \"don't be evil\".</p><p>Google sold consumers on the idea that it could be trusted with their most personal information. Their web searches, photos, emails, documents, video clips and smartphone operating system were entrusted to the web giant because it held itself to a higher ethical standard - it was not \"evil\".</p><p>Fast forward to the 2010s. Google's Android came pre-installed on around 79% of all smartphones shipped worldwide in 2013. The company has come to dominate online advertising, maps, search and videos among various other fields.</p><p>It's true that most of the underlying code for Android is open source, and that in theory device makers could create their own version of Android.</p><p>In practice, if device makers want their products to have access to the Google Play app ecosystem or Google's apps - including Google Maps, Google Now, Hangouts, Gmail and YouTube - they must run Google's version of Android.</p><p>Sure, there have been successful non-Google Android devices. Amazon has a strong enough app, e-book, music and video ecosystem to support its own version of Android on its Kindle devices.</p><p>However, a company like Asus doesn't have that sort of ecosystem. For them, losing the ability to preinstall their devices with Google's apps would be costly.</p><p>According to most of the reports, it is this threat that Google has used to get Asus to kill off the Transformer Book Duet.</p><p>Now, it's important to point out that there might be more to the story than the public currently knows. Google hasn't come forward with its version of events, nor - insofar as I'm aware - has it issued an official statement on the matter.</p><p>Nonetheless, if the speculation about it applying pressure on Asus to kill off the Duet is true, Google needs to tread very carefully. This is precisely the type of anti-competitive behaviour that gets both competition regulators and consumers offside.</p><p>In my opinion, the success or failure of Android, Windows, iOS or any other operating system should be decided in the free market through the preference of consumers, rather than by big tech companies leveraging their monopolies.</p><p>In short, Google should remember its corporate slogan - don't be evil!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BR2-RSJ1-F0NT-H0MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><timeReceived>10:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 12, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

Big tech companies started beefing up their own health software businesses to take advantage of the opportunity. </p><p> But most health care providers waited to buy the expensive equipment while the administration finalized rules on reimbursements for costs related to implementing the systems. The Department of Health and Human Services released 864 pages of regulations Tuesday. </p><p> Computerizing medical records, in theory, will cut costs and reduce errors. For companies with large health care divisions, such as McKesson, Cerner, Microsoft, Google, Siemens and General Electric, the regulations mean billions of dollars in potential revenue. </p><p> \"There's been a lot of uncertainty in the provider community about what kind of equipment they should be purchasing, so they've been holding back from buying anything,\" said David Main, chairman of the health care regulatory practice at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. \"Now they can make plans to buy.\" </p><p> But that doesn't mean all hospitals and doctors will jump on the digital record bandwagon right away. Physicians complain the software programs are too complex and take too much time to fill out, especially in fast-paced environments like emergency rooms. </p><p> And all the software products have to go through a certification process, and it's not yet clear how companies can dispute failing grades. Regardless of the kinks, providers will face penalties if they don't adopt the new technology by 2015, a timeline some say will cause gridlock. </p><p> Don May, the American Hospital Association's vice president for policy, says the pressing timeline could impose a burden on infrastructure. </p><p> \"Everyone is going to vendors at the same time,\" he said. \"Even if [the hospital] is ready today, they may have to wait 18 months before the vendor goes out to implement it. \"What we've created is this market that's going to be like 495 at rush hour,\" he says, referring to the Capital Beltway.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-39752</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YY9-B831-2SDF-F0NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><timeReceived>4:26 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2010  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>July 15, 2010 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0006E41</classCode><className>PILLSBURY WINTHROP SHAW PITTMAN LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIN (SWX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIE (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIE (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GNE (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GEC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GE (SWX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Healthcare Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUNBQzhDMTI1NTM2NEFBNUE0RjEzRjMyNDdEOTg3ODI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkQ5QTg4MzhENENGNEFDRDhDMzdDMDRCQjMwM0IxMjk</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVBOTZDMzQ2MUE4NDA1N0E0NDQyMUNBNzE1QUVCREQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1NEQ5NkFBQjhENEUyMjhDMjM2MjRFQkVBOTFDODI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIwM0E1RTM4NkY5NEU4QjhBM0RCNzc5QjE4RkIzOEI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Public Health &amp;

A new California law on privacy is also creating dismay, though in a different way: Few companies agree on what the law means, Natasha Singer wrote. </p><p>SoftBank, famous these days for its investments in overhyped start-ups, faces trouble in India for funding Oyo, a start-up with a noxious work environment, Vindu Goel and Karan Deep Singh wrote.</p><p>  The Hidden Gems From 2019 </p><p>  The day after Robert Mueller's congressional testimony, Steve Lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concern but a wealth and power concentration concern, too. </p><p>  Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>  The morning after the House impeachment vote, Karen Weise published an investigation into how Amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.</p><p>  ''Some guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, 'We have changed the rules,''' said Charlie Cole, who runs Tumi's online business. He pushed back, but wasn't successful. ''It was like talking to a brick wall,'' he said. ''They want to be able to control everything.''</p><p>  Cade Metz went to Bhubaneswar, India, to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. He wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless. </p><p>  In facilities like the one I visited in Bhubaneswar and in other cities in India, China, Nepal, the Philippines, East Africa and the United States, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.</p><p>  Jack Nicas and Keith Collins exposed the way Apple's algorithms kept Apple services ranked high in the App Store. Midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. Apple representatives told Jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors. </p><p>  If you searched for ''podcast'' in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.</p><p>  Just as the holidays were kicking off, Adam Satariano had a tale from the Faroe Islands, ''At the Edge of the World, a New Battleground for the U.S. and China.'' The photos by Ben Quinton are especially stunning. </p><p>  No location is now too small for the United States and China to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. The Faroe Islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across Europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over Huawei, the crown jewel of the Chinese tech sector.</p><p>  Davey Alba, the tech team's new reporter on disinformation, wrote about how Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation. It didn't happen as promised.</p><p>  As a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.</p><p>  During summer's long vacation-filled months, Brian Chen wrote a confessional: ''I Shared My Phone Number. I Learned I Shouldn't Have.''</p><p>  For most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. In August, I learned this was a bad idea.</p><p>  Natasha Singer profiled Baroness Beeban Kidron, a member of Britain's House of Lords who is fighting Big Tech on behalf of children's privacy.</p><p>  ''The idea that it's O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons -- it's not a fair fight,'' Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. ''It's little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.''</p><p>  And last but not least, Daisuke Wakabayashi profiled Luigi Zingales, a professor from the famously free-market University of Chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.</p><p>  ''My conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,'' Mr. Zingales said. </p><p>  Happy New Year!

(Gian Ehrenzeller/Keystone via AP)DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 The United States, the European Union and what will soon be post-Brexit Britain have all raised the prospect of concluding trade deals between themselves by the end of this year, setting up an intense few months of negotiations. High-level representatives said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos that it's possible that those discussions, operating in parallel, could be wrapped up by the end of the year. </p><p>That would be some achievement given that most trade deals take years as they get bogged down in minutiae of rules and regulations. 'Never rule out a miracle, of course, but let's just see how these good intentions roll down the snowy hills of Davos as reality sinks in next week,' analysts at Rabobank International said in a note to investors. Britain could be a focal point. It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing. Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are. At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, particularly about trade. 'It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.  Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his 'top priority,' discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.  Mnuchin said that was 'obviously an aggressive timeline.\"  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.  'Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said. Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service. 'What we think is that drugs should have similar prices wherever they are but I don't believe we are in any position to tell the U.K. what they should pay for drugs,\" he said. Though the U.S. is hugely important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU \u2014 that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible. Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.  'Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. 'It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\" How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder. 'As we leave there's bound to be change but we have also been clear that there's no point in leaving the EU but sticking with all its rules and regulations forever,' he said. Given that stance, expectations are slim for anything more than a bare-bones trade agreement. 'Hopefully we can minimize the disruption as much as possible,\" said Roberto Gualtieri, Italy's new finance minister. The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured 'within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.  She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days. Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, 'is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\" On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's 'aggressive\" approach. 'If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. 'It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough. We can be offensive.\" The approach seems to be setting the tone for what are likely to be complicated discussions between the EU and the U.S. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AMCN134119157978837865125876100060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIPR-134119</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y22-2WB1-F03R-N1VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><timeReceived>2:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>MarketBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>COOPERATIEVE CENTRALE RAIFFEISEN-BOERENLEENBANK BA (RABOBANK)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp;

It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing. </p><p>Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are. </p><p>At a news briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, to discuss an array of issues including trade. </p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump, and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said. </p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU. </p><p>\"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said. </p><p>Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service. </p><p>Though the U.S. is important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU -- that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible. </p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party. </p><p>\"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\" </p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to all EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder. </p><p>\"Of course, we won't suddenly stop being part of this continent of like-minded countries in eight days,\" Javid told an audience of business leaders in Davos. \"Both sides in the debate want our close relationship to continue but that relationship is going to change.\" </p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels. </p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials. </p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days. </p><p>Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\" </p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development. </p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach. </p><p>\"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. \"It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough. We can be offensive.\" </p><p>The approach seems to be setting the tone for what are likely to be complicated discussions between the EU and the U.S. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-2228364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2C-5TG1-DYCW-C3X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COOPERATIEVE CENTRALE RAIFFEISEN-BOERENLEENBANK BA (RABOBANK)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are.</p><p>At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, to discuss an array of issues including trade.</p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his \"top priority,\" discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.</p><p>Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\"</p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.</p><p>\"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said.</p><p>Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service.</p><p>Though the U.S. is important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU - that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.</p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.</p><p>\"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\"</p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to all EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder.</p><p>\"Of course, we won't suddenly stop being part of this continent of like-minded countries in eight days,\" Javid told an audience of business leaders in Davos. \"Both sides in the debate want our close relationship to continue but that relationship is going to change.\"</p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.</p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days.</p><p>Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine.

It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are.</p><p>At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, to discuss an array of issues including trade.</p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his \"top priority,\" discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.</p><p>Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\"</p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.</p><p>\"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said.</p><p>Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service.</p><p>Though the U.S. is important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU - that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.</p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.</p><p>\"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\"</p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to all EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder.</p><p>\"Of course, we won't suddenly stop being part of this continent of like-minded countries in eight days,\" Javid told an audience of business leaders in Davos. \"Both sides in the debate want our close relationship to continue but that relationship is going to change.\"</p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.</p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days.</p><p>Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach.</p><p>\"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. \"It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough.

It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are.</p><p>At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, to discuss an array of issues including trade.</p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his \"top priority,\" discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.</p><p>Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\"</p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.</p><p>\"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and co-ordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said.</p><p>Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service.</p><p>Though the U.S. is important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU - that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.</p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.</p><p>\"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\"</p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to all EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder.</p><p>\"Of course, we won't suddenly stop being part of this continent of like-minded countries in eight days,\" Javid told an audience of business leaders in Davos. \"Both sides in the debate want our close relationship to continue but that relationship is going to change.\"</p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.</p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days.</p><p>Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach.</p><p>\"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. \"It would have been buried, to be very clear.

High-level representatives said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos that it's possible that those discussions, operating in parallel, could be wrapped up by the end of the year. That would be some achievement given that most trade deals take years as they get bogged down in minutiae of rules and regulations. </p><p>\"Never rule out a miracle, of course, but let's just see how these good intentions roll down the snowy hills of Davos as reality sinks in next week,\" analysts at Rabobank International said in a note to investors. Britain could be a focal point. It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing. Members of Trump's Cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are. At a press briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his counterpart, Sajid Javid, particularly about trade. \"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mnuchin said.Though Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his ``top priority,'' discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time. Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU. \"Both are very heavily services-oriented and within services, such as financial services there's already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said. Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service. \"What we think is that drugs should have similar prices wherever they are but I don't believe we are in any position to tell the U.K. what they should pay for drugs,\" he said. Though the U.S. is hugely important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU   that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit following last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party. \"Eleven months for a free trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months but I think it is still possible.\" How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder. \"As we leave there's bound to be change but we have also been clear that there's no point in leaving the EU but sticking with all its rules and regulations forever,\" he said. Given that stance, expectations are slim for anything more than a bare-bones trade agreement.\"Hopefully we can minimize the disruption as much as possible,\" said Roberto Gualtieri, Italy's new finance minister. The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of American businesses by Brussels. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials. She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days. Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of tariffs, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\" On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms like Google and Facebook in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach. \"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. \"It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough. We can be offensive.\" The approach seems to be setting the tone for what are likely to be complicated discussions </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS130912157979918806875776100097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y21-W251-JB5Y-N413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COOPERATIEVE CENTRALE RAIFFEISEN-BOERENLEENBANK BA (RABOBANK)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;
