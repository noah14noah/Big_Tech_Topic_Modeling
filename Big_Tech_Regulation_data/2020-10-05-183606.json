The Aug. 31 paper listed five forward-looking scenarios for the banking sector amid competition from fintech firms. The report suggested that the future will likely have elements of all five possibilities.</p><p>\"The one that I gravitate to is the 'relegated bank,'\" said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and a partner at Autonomous Research.</p><p>The Bank of International Settlements described the \"relegated bank\" scenario as one in which incumbent banks become mere providers of infrastructure while fintech companies exclusively handle all interactions with customers. Sokolin said he can see a situation where incumbent financial institutions manufacture and provide investment or financial products. Fintech would become \"a layer for internal efficiency and integration between financial services firms and the big tech firms,\" he said.</p><p>Large technology companies would manage consumer relationships and offer virtual assistance with artificial intelligence in such a world, according to Sokolin. Instead of being a stand-alone offering, finance would become a feature within a broader offering, he added.</p><p>While Sokolin sees that as the most likely path for the various players in the finance and technology space, not all companies will ascribe to the \"relegated bank\" scenario exclusively. \"There will be plenty of old banks made better with new infrastructure,\" he said.</p><p>This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that payments company Square Inc. is aiming to get into the banking business by seeking a license to operate as an industrial loan company in Utah.</p><p>Bloomberg News reported that lenders have asked International Business Machines Corp. if its technology can be used to monitor retail-banking salespeople, loan officers and other workers, according to Marc Andrews, a manager on the company s Watson financial services team. The inquiry comes at a time when banks are already using algorithms to monitor traders.</p><p>Military veteran-focused small-business lender StreetShares named Ed Walters as its chief marketing officer.

These opportunistic strategies raise various issues under securities, derivatives, conduct and antifraud laws, as well as public policy concerns.'<br/><br/> The statement adds, in part: 'As a result... the agencies will make collaborative efforts to prioritize the exploration of avenues, including industry input [that] will address these concerns and foster transparency, accountability, integrity, good conduct and investor protection in these markets.'<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/business/nissan-annual-meeting-ghosn-saikawa.html\">The New York Times</url> reported that Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa was re-elected to the company's board during an AGM.

Two Allergan directors will join AbbVie's board when the deal closes.<br/><br/><br/> - A small but growing number of companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and candy-maker Mars, have started linking a portion of executive pay to corporate ESG goals, using a tactic they say helps align management's thinking with the company's ESG strategy, according to the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-companies-link-executive-pay-to-sustainability-targets-11561379745?mod=hp_jr_pos1\">WSJ</url>. The idea is to give managers a personal incentive to incorporate such considerations into everyday business decisions.<br/><br/> Proponents argue that if everyone from the CEO to the plant manager takes into account things such as carbon emissions in capital-expenditure decisions, rank-and-file employees will also be more likely to make choices that help the company reach its goals more quickly.<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/supreme-court-refuses-to-overturn-auer-rule-that-bolsters-regulators.html\">CNBC</url> reported that the US Supreme Court declined to overturn a precedent that strengthens the power of government regulators.

It can also ask for a closed-door hearing to defend itself. Broadcom said it believes it complies with European Competition rules and that the concerns are 'without merit.'<br/><br/><br/> - According to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-business/supreme-courts-business-friendly-reputation-takes-a-hit-idUSKCN1TR302\">Reuters</url>, the US Supreme Court in its term that concludes this week was not quite as business-friendly as it has been in recent years. Overall, the court's rulings were more pro-business than against - as has been the case under conservative Chief Justice John Roberts - but it also indicated that there are limits to what business can expect.<br/><br/> Although the court in recent years has broadly favored the business community over employees, consumers and regulators, several cases were decided this term in favor of challengers to corporate interests on issues such as class-action litigation, antitrust law, arbitration, investor protection and the environment.<br/><br/><br/> - Carl Icahn is seeking to replace four directors at Occidental Petroleum, saying the company's board mismanaged its $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-icahn-seeks-to-replace-four-occidental-directors-11561587365?mod=itp_wsj&amp;ru=yahoo\">WSJ</url> reported. The pending deal revealed a lack of 'effective corporate governance' and the company needs new directors to ensure the acquisition realizes its cost savings, Icahn said in a letter to shareholders.<br/><br/> Although Icahn has previously acknowledged that the deal is likely to close despite some investor disapproval, he asked shareholders to request that Occidental set a date to consider his proposal, adding that it is a necessary step in the process to nominate new directors.<br/><br/> 'We will review the latest materials filed by Mr Icahn and look forward to addressing them in our ongoing conversations with Occidental shareholders,' Occidental said in a statement. Anadarko didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/28/investing/fed-approval-buybacks-dividend-hikes/index.html\">CNN</url> reported that major US banks are preparing to dole out larger dividend payouts after the Federal Reserve gave them the go-ahead. Lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are able to increase their payouts after the Fed's stress test rated them well capitalized. The approved capital plans also include room for share buybacks.<br/><br/><br/> - ISS urged investors of natural gas producer EQT Corp to vote in favor of all nominees put forward by shareholders Toby and Derek Rice,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eqt-corp-shareholders/proxy-adviser-iss-recommends-eqt-shareholders-vote-for-rice-nominees-idUSKCN1TT21S\">Reuters</url> reported. The Rice brothers were part of the founding team at Rice Energy, which EQT bought in November 2017. They have been pushing for a change in EQT's strategy and a revamp of its 12-member board.<br/><br/> 'Although the board has undergone considerable refreshment since the 2017 merger... the significant value destruction overseen by legacy directors in the interim poses a question to shareholders,' the ISS report stated. It said shareholders should support all seven nominees by the Rice brothers and five existing members of the board it backs.<br/><br/>EQT did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.corporatesecretary.com/sites/default/files/field/image/GRC%20WEEK%20%281%29_50.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORSEC-31681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORSEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHS-HY81-JB73-105X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468490</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corporatesecretary.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 28, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC0002M9Q</classCode><className>CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002DVV</classCode><className>COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002HQL</classCode><className>NISSAN MOTOR CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002DVV</classCode><className>COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS721120 CASINO HOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp;

A new 'statement of purpose' from the BRT places shareholders as one of five stakeholders, alongside customers, workers, suppliers and communities - a departure from the belief that businesses serve the owners of their capital. Companies should 'protect the environment' and treat workers with 'dignity and respect' while also delivering long-term profits for shareholders, the BRT said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The change outlines a call to reform capitalism in a time when populism and concern about climate change have led politicians and shareholder activists to demand that companies consider their impact on the world beyond their balance sheets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/deadline-looms-for-u-s-employers-to-report-pay-for-women-minorities-11566213788?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal</url>, US companies are gearing up to give the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the most detailed information ever collected about how they compensate workers of all genders, races and ethnicities. All employers with more than 100 workers must disclose a broad array of pay information to the EEOC by September 30, a process that agency officials have said is part of government efforts to narrow long-standing earnings gaps.</p><p>EEOC officials have said the detailed data about typical salaries across different industries and regions will help investigators more quickly determine which discrimination complaints merit closer scrutiny. The new mandate increases the pressure on employers from lawmakers, workers and investors to tackle discrepancies in the way women and minorities are paid.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/business/hong-kong-protests-apple-daily/index.html\">CNN</url> reported that the Big Four accounting firms are distancing themselves from a newspaper advertisement in which people claiming to be their employees express support for protesters in Hong Kong. Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC said the advertisement, which was published in Hong Kong's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple Daily</emphasis>, does not represent the firms' views.</p><p>The advertisement reiterated five demands by activists, including the complete withdrawal of a proposed bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, and that authorities drop criminal charges against protesters and establish an independent commission to investigate possible police misconduct.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/racketeering-lawsuit-mckinsey-dismissed.html\">The New York Times</url> reported that a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company of intentionally filing false statements in several bankruptcy courts to secure contracts to work on big corporate restructurings. Jay Alix, a retired restructuring specialist, has accused McKinsey of repeatedly defrauding the bankruptcy courts from 2001 onward, and filed the suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which allows private citizens to file claims if they feel they have been harmed by a criminal enterprise.</p><p>McKinsey's chair for North America, Gary Pinkus, said the firm was pleased a federal court had dismissed Alix's lawsuit. In addition to that case, he said Alix had filed objections to McKinsey's work as an adviser to six bankrupt companies, and three bankruptcy courts had found he did not have standing.</p><p>Alix said the ruling on Monday was 'based on a technicality', not on the merits of his allegations, and cited a passage where the judge acknowledged his 'good reasons' for bringing the case.</p><p>- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp voted to approve a five-agency revision of the Volcker Rule, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/fdic-approves-volcker-rule-overhaul-eases-wall-street-trading-rules.html\">CNBC</url>. If approved by all regulators, the change would help clarify the way in which banks trade securities using their own funds, or proprietary trading. The regulators hope to clarify the definition of proprietary trading and adjust the ban that prohibits banks from making short-term investments with their own capital, following industry complaints that the rules are too complex and burdensome.</p><p>- The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-drops-foreign-bribery-probe-into-medical-device-maker-11566250388?mod=hp_minor_pos12\">WSJ</url> reported that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) closed a foreign bribery investigation into medical device maker Misonix's former distributor in China. Misonix received a letter from the DoJ saying there won't be any enforcement action in connection with its China business, the company said in a securities filing. The decision follows a separate move by the SEC in June to end its own foreign bribery probe into the company.</p><p>The investigations came to a close almost three years after Misonix voluntarily alerted US authorities to potential issues at its business in China. Misonix co-operated with the government in the parallel investigations, the company said. It didn't respond to a request for further comment.</p><p>- The SEC issued new guidance designed to clarify how investors and advisory firms that cast ballots on their behalf should vote in corporate elections on issues such as pay and diversity, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-proxy-advisors/u-s-regulator-votes-to-propose-new-guidelines-on-shareholder-advisers-idUSKCN1VB1Q0\">Reuters</url> said. The guidance, which expands guidance from 2014 on shareholder voting in corporate ballots, addresses some of the concerns US corporations have about proxy advisers, such as what they say are mistakes in reports the advisers issue on specific companies and conflicts of interest in their business models.</p><p>The SEC voted 3-2 to publish the new guidance, with Democratic commissioners dissenting because they say it could add risks to shareholders' rights and costs for the proxy advisers. ISS CEO Gary Retelny said in a statement that the firm was 'concerned the guidance will hamper our ability to deliver' its research to investors. Both ISS and Glass Lewis could potentially seek legal action if they believe the guidance breaches federal law.</p><p>- According to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sustainably-fracked-shale-producers-seek-a-green-label-for-their-natural-gas-11566475200?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\">WSJ</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis>some shale drillers are trying to show consumers that their natural gas was sustainably fracked. Amid mounting investor pressure over climate change, many of the companies behind the US shale boom are stepping up efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, toxic wastewater and other environmental impacts tied to fracking. Now, some are looking to monetize those investments by marketing their natural gas as a cleaner fossil fuel, akin to organic vegetables or fair-trade coffee.</p><p>Some environmental groups argue that regulation, not green marketing, is the way to ensure sustainable practices. Unlike fair-trade standards or federal rules that govern organic labeling, there is no widely accepted industry definition for responsibly fracked gas. 'It's hard not to be dismissive,' said Andrew Logan, senior director for oil and gas at Ceres.</p><p>- Kraft and Mondelez are taking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to court in an effort to prevent the agency from discussing a $16 million fine to settle allegations of manipulating the wheat markets, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/kraft-is-suing-the-cftc-to-keep-the-lid-on-16-million-fine.html\">CNBC</url> reported. The two food companies agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the CFTC that the companies got to restrict what the agency could say about the case. Kraft and Mondelez, which was created when Kraft split into two companies in 2012, are now suing the CFTC for contempt in relation to an August 15 press release announcing the deal.</p><p>'The CFTC and its commissioners engaged in a deliberate, orchestrated effort to violate the court's consent order within minutes of its entry,' the companies said in the filing. The consent order included a clause that read 'neither party shall make any public statement about this case other than to refer to the terms of this settlement agreement or public documents filed in this case.' The order also prohibited the CFTC from saying whether either defendant violated federal law.</p><p>The CFTC told the court that its public statements didn't violate the order and that its individual commissioners were not bound by the agreement. The CFTC voluntarily removed the announcement from its website until the next court appearance. The CFTC and Kraft declined to comment for this article. Mondelez did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/investing/stock-buybacks-drop-tax-cuts/index.html\">CNN</url> said US companies' buyback frenzy may be subsiding. S&amp;P 500 companies responded to the 2017 corporate tax cut by rewarding shareholders with record amounts of buybacks in 2018, with each quarter setting an all-time high. But that record-shattering pace appears to be slowing. S&amp;P 500 companies executed $165.7 billion of buybacks during the second quarter of 2019, according to preliminary estimates by S&amp;PDow Jones Indices. Although that's still a stunning amount, it is a 13 percent decline from the same period a year ago.</p><p>- The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hp-ceo-dion-weisler-stepping-down-11566504620?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">WSJ</url> reported that HP CEO Dion Weisler will step down later this year for family health reasons. Weisler, who took over as HP's CEO in 2015, will be succeeded by Enrique Lores, the head of the company's imaging, printing and solutions business. Lores, who joined the company as an intern 30 years ago, will take over the top job on November 1 and work with Weisler through January 2020 to help with the transition, the company said.</p><p>- Representatives Katie Porter, D-California and Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-New York have asked the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to consider direct oversight of the cloud services big tech companies provide to banks, saying they have become a key component of the global financial system, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-cloud/u-s-house-lawmakers-ask-regulators-to-scrutinize-bank-cloud-providers-idUSKCN1VD0Y4\">Reuters</url> reported.</p><p>'Cloud services have become an essential element of our modern banking system and should be overseen commensurately,' the lawmakers, who both sit on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote in a letter to the FSOC.

The amount of the settlement could change depending on the number of claims still to be filed by consumers. Equifax will also pay $275 million in civil penalties and other compensation to 48 states, Washington, Puerto Rico and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p><br/><br/> The deal further requires more changes to how Equifax deals with private user data. The FTC alleges that Equifax failed to properly safeguard people's personal information despite claiming in its privacy policy that it implemented 'reasonable physical, technical and procedural safeguards' to protect their data.<br/><br/> Equifax did not respond to a request for comment. According to the FTC's proposed settlements, the company neither admits nor denies any of the allegations.<br/><br/><br/> - The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42fc7cfc-a4c1-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d\">Financial Times</url> said JPMorgan Chase launched a data analytics tool designed to predict how activist investors will influence other company shareholders. A record $1.1 trillion in US corporate takeovers during the first half of the year means activist investors are at the top of board agendas.<br/><br/>JPMorgan believes its method can generate more useful insights than can be gained from analyzing factors such as how much cash a company holds or how activists have behaved previously. 'If all the focus of the company is on this very vocal and very loud shareholder... we think that is the wrong way to deal with it,' Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan's head of North American M&amp;A, said. 'Instead we're saying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Let's look at who are all of your shareholders, what can we learn about them and how they have acted in the context of these activists and how that will inform our strategy with respect to long-term shareholders</emphasis>.'<br/><br/><br/> - According to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amerisur-m-a-maurel-prom/oil-company-amerisur-snubs-bid-overture-from-french-rival-maurel-prom-idUSKCN1UH0ET\">Reuters</url>, Latin America-focused oil exploration company Amerisur Resources rejected overtures from French rival Maurel &amp; Prom (M&amp;P), saying Maurel's possible \u00a3210 million ($263 million) offer undervalued it. 'Following the approach from M&amp;P concerning its possible offer and the receipt of other interest in the company, the board concluded that the M&amp;P possible offer materially undervalued the company and was not at a level, nor in a form, that merited further consideration,' Amerisur said.<br/><br/> 'M&amp;P sees considerable benefit to shareholders from a combination and believes the enlarged group would offer significant value upside for both Amerisur's and M&amp;P's shareholders,' the French company said in a statement.<br/><br/><br/> - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The </emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/autonation-names-new-ceo-months-after-hiring-outsider-11563836196\">Wall Street J</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ournal</emphasis> reported that AutoNation, the largest US car dealership chain, promoted CFO Cheryl Miller to the role of CEO just months after hiring an industry outsider as its leader. Carl Liebert, who the company said plans to stay on for 30 days to help with the transition, became CEO in March this year. He succeeded Mike Jackson, who led the company for two decades.<br/><br/> 'It was a risk that we took with Carl in that he was entirely new to automotive retail,' said Jackson, who is now the company's executive chair. 'We came to the conclusion that it was not a good fit. Automotive retail is a unique industry, and it's either something you can get your head around or it's like a foreign language.'<br/><br/> Jackson said the decision to replace Liebert was mutual. Liebert could not be reached for comment. At the time of his hiring, AutoNation said the company's two largest investors supported the board's decision to hire an industry outsider.<br/><br/><br/> - The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-138\">SEC</url> announced a half-million-dollar award to an overseas whistleblower whose reporting helped the agency bring a successful enforcement action. 'With recent actions, more than $2 billion in monetary sanctions have been ordered against wrongdoers based on actionable information received by whistleblowers' said Jane Norberg, chief of the SEC's office of the whistleblower. 'This represents the direct and important role that whistleblowers, like the overseas whistleblower being awarded today, have in enforcement actions and the protection of investors.'<br/><br/><br/> - The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77c1d4c4-acc7-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2\">FT</url> said Bank of America and UBS have reshuffled their investment banking teams in a push into the market for fund-raising and advisory work on behalf of private companies, as businesses delay going public and fees from IPOs come under pressure. Both banks have this month created new teams focused on capital-raising and advice to privately owned businesses, according to memos seen by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FT</emphasis>. The moves reflect how early introductions to such companies have become increasingly important as banks look to generate revenues from advising on IPOs and M&amp;A.<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/23/tech/justice-department-big-tech-antitrust/index.html\">CNN</url> reported that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is launching a formal antitrust review of the largest US tech companies. The review appears to be broad in scope and could cover conduct by numerous firms. Although Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google were not named by the DoJ on Tuesday, the agency indicated it will look into areas where those companies are dominant.<br/><br/> 'The department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media and some retail services online,' the DoJ said. 'The department's antitrust division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others.'<br/><br/>Amazon and Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment, and Google also declined to comment but referred to testimony company executives delivered before Congress this month.<br/><br/><br/> - Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine and to better police its data privacy practices to settle a federal investigation, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-agrees-to-pay-5-billion-in-ftc-settlement-11563971400?mod=hp_lead_pos3\">WSJ</url> reported. Under the settlement, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg must certify that the company is in compliance with new privacy strictures and could be subject to civil and criminal penalties for false certifications.<br/><br/> The settlement with the FTC requires the creation of a new committee of Facebook's board to monitor the company's privacy practices. Legal experts said they couldn't recall previous FTC privacy settlements imposing such a requirement. Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said the agreement 'will mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a scale different from anything we've done in the past.'<br/><br/> Separately, the SEC announced a settlement with Facebook - including a $100 million fine - over claims it misled investors about the misuse of customer data. Facebook neither admitted nor denied the SEC claims. The company said it shares the agency's view that it be 'transparent with our investors about the material risks we face, and we have already updated our disclosures and controls in this area.'<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/success/copart-woman-sp-500-board/index.html\">CNN</url> reported that there are no longer any companies on the S&amp;P 500 with an all-male board after Copart, an online auto auction website, named Diane Morefield, CFO of real estate investment trust CyrusOne, as a director. The company also appointed Stephen Fisher, former chief technology officer for eBay, to its board.<br/><br/> Until recently, TripAdvisor was the other S&amp;P 500 company that didn't have any female directors, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. But the company appointed two women to its board in March.<br/><br/> More attention has been given to the composition of boards amid calls for greater gender equity in the workplace and an increased sense of urgency for change following the #MeToo movement, a recent report from Heidrick &amp; Struggles found.<br/><br/><br/> - According to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/occidental-iss/update-2-iss-backs-icahns-call-for-more-shareholder-say-after-anadarko-deal-idUKL2N24Q0L5\">Reuters</url>, ISS urged Occidental Petroleum shareholders to ask management to let them weigh in on board and governance issues as the company buys rival Anadarko Petroleum. The request came a week after the takeover's biggest critic, Carl Icahn, laid out plans to revamp Occidental's board.<br/><br/> ISS issued a research note recommending that shareholders provide consent for the request to fix a record date, which would determine which shareholders would be able to have a say on possibly electing dissident directors. The note says ISS is not backing Icahn's nominees or planned changes.<br/><br/> Occidental said it disagreed with ISS' recommendation that shareholders should take the first step and request the fixing of a record date for the consent solicitation and only later focus on whether the Icahn Group's proposals would harm or further shareholder interests.<br/><br/> 'The board of directors has unanimously determined that fixing a record date for the Icahn Group's planned consent solicitation and the proposals the Icahn Group intends to ask shareholders to act on are NOT in the best interests of Occidental or our shareholders,' the company said in a statement.<br/><br/><br/> - Fines levied by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have hit a decade high at a time when the Trump administration is increasingly using sanctions as a foreign policy tool, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-compliance-fines-hit-decade-high-11564057920?mod=hp_minor_pos10\">WSJ</url> said. Roughly $1.3 billion in total penalties have been issued by OFAC this year. The year-to-date total, from 18 settlements, is already more than 17 times the total issued in all of 2018, when there were seven settlements.<br/><br/> 'It speaks more to the fact that we had a lot of cases this year that were ripe and ready to be issued,' said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. This year's enforcement actions reflect a broadening range and the diversity of sanctions programs being enforced, said Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher partner Adam Smith.<br/><br/><br/> -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/business/ford-honda-volkswagen-bmw-emissions-deal-california/index.html\">CNN</url> reported that four of the world's largest car manufacturers - Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW - are planning to make more fuel-efficient vehicles for the US market, despite the Trump administration's plans to roll back regulations. The companies have reached a deal with air quality regulators in California, promising to provide fleets of cars that average 50 miles per gallon by model year 2026, and they vowed to stick to that standard in all 50 states.<br/><br/> The move will put the four companies on track to comply with tougher emissions rules even as the Trump administration works to roll back policies put in place under former president Barack Obama. Regulatory pressures around the world, including in Europe and China, are pushing carmakers to produce electric vehicles.<br/><br/><br/> - According to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eib-climate-fossilfuels/european-investment-bank-proposes-end-to-fossil-fuel-lending-idUSKCN1UL1PX\">Reuters</url>, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has proposed an end to lending for fossil fuel-reliant energy projects by the end of 2020. The bank said it would phase out support for energy projects that were 'reliant on fossil fuels: oil and gas production, infrastructure primarily dedicated to natural gas, power generation or heat based on fossil fuels.'<br/><br/> The EIB board, which is made up mostly of EU finance ministers, is expected to discuss the proposal at a meeting in September, although a final decision could take longer. 'This long-term transition (to greener energy sources) is profound. Solidarity is required to ensure that potentially vulnerable groups or regions are supported,' the EIB proposal document said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.corporatesecretary.com/sites/default/files/field/image/GRC%20WEEK%20%281%29_54.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORSEC-31719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORSEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNJ-7C01-JB73-1148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468490</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corporatesecretary.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Energy minister Khalid-Al Falih was succeeded as chair of the state-owned oil company by Yasir Al Rumayyan, head of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Aramco said in a statement. The leadership change is the latest in a series of developments to prepare Aramco to go public in what could be the world's biggest IPO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- AT&amp;T said WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey will become its new president and COO, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/03/att-names-warnermedia-boss-john-stankey-president-and-coo.html\">CNBC</url>. Stankey will continue to be CEO of WarnerMedia while taking on the newly created position, effective October 1. As president and COO, Stankey will report to AT&amp;T chair and CEO Randall Stephenson. The promotion comes a few months after WarnerMedia announced an organizational shift under its new parent company, AT&amp;T.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AT&amp;T also said Jeff McElfresh will become CEO of AT&amp;T Communications, effective October 1, replacing John Donovan, who previously announced his retirement.</p><p>- The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-170\">SEC</url> named Monique Winkler as associate regional director for enforcement in the agency's San Francisco regional office. She succeeds Erin Schneider, who became regional director of the office in May 2019.</p><p>- The We Company, which owns WeWork, said it will add a woman, Frances Frei, to its board of directors, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-wework-ipo/wework-adds-woman-to-its-board-after-backlash-ahead-of-ipo-idUSKCN1VP1ES\">Reuters</url> reported. The move comes after criticism of We Company's IPO filing last month, which showed it planned to go public with an all-male board of directors. 'Frances Frei will join our board of directors upon the completion of this offering,' the company said in an amended filing for its planned IPO. 'She currently serves as a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School and has provided human resources consulting services to The We Company since March 2019.'</p><p>The company said it will add another director to its board within a year of the IPO, 'with a commitment to increasing the board's gender and ethnic diversity.' It had originally planned to go public with an all-male seven-member board, a practice frowned upon by such major investors as BlackRock.</p><p>- According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/google-youtube-ftc-settlement/index.html\">CNN</url>, the Federal Trade Commission said Google agreed to pay a record $170 million penalty to settle accusations that YouTube broke the law when it knowingly tracked and sold ads targeted at children. The settlement involves the largest penalty under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which YouTube allegedly violated by collecting user information from children to fuel its behavioral advertising business.</p><p>'We know how important it is to provide children, families and family creators the best experience possible on YouTube and we are committed to getting it right,' Google said in a blog post about the settlement. Google also said it will use machine learning algorithms to proactively identify children's content on the platform and that, beginning in four months, data collected from all children's content will be treated as though it were coming from a child viewer. The company settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/owner-of-coach-kate-spade-ousts-ceo-11567607099?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\">The Wall Street Journal</url> reported that Tapestry, the handbag company that combined the Coach and Kate Spade brands, ousted its CEO a little over two years after the merger. Tapestry said Victor Luis, who has been CEO for five years, is leaving immediately and will be succeeded by board chair Jide Zeitlin. Zeitlin is a former Goldman Sachs executive who has been on the board since 2006.</p><p>Zeitlin said the company was committed to its multi-brand strategy but needed to work on execution. He will remain board chair. The company also said board member Susan Kropf, a former Avon executive, has been named lead independent director.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pcaob-enforcement/u-s-audit-regulator-levied-only-6-5-mln-in-fines-in-16-years-study-idUSL2N25V1UX\">Reuters</url> reported that, according to a study published by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), the PCAOB has brought only 18 enforcement actions and levied just $6.5 million in fines against the Big Four accounting firms in its 16-year existence. The report could increase pressure on the agency, which in recent years has been criticized for being too close to the industry it oversees and slow to ensure the industry does its job. 'It's unacceptable that the agency is taking such a light-handed approach in holding these large audit firms accountable,' POGO executive director Danielle Brian said.</p><p>Some industry advocates and former PCAOB board members say it should not be held to the same standard as the SEC and that its main function is not enforcement but to help raise the quality of audits. POGO cites written comment from a PCAOB spokesperson stating that due to resource constraints the regulator is selective about the enforcement cases it pursues. 'Not every inspection-related deficiency rises to such a level of severity that it should result in an enforcement investigation or the institution of an enforcement proceeding,' the spokesperson wrote, according to POGO.</p><p>- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/facebook-users-phone-numbers-privacy-lapse\">The Guardian</url> said Facebook confirmed that hundreds of millions of its users' phone numbers were exposed in an open online database. More than 419 million Facebook IDs and phone numbers were stored in an online server that was not password-protected, the technology website TechCrunch reported. The database was taken offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host.</p><p>Facebook confirmed the report and said it was investigating when and by whom the database was compiled. A spokesperson for the company also claimed that the number of users whose information was exposed was approximately 210 million because the 419 million records contained duplicates. 'This dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people's ability to find others using their phone numbers,' a spokesperson said in a statement. 'The dataset has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised.'</p><p>- Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, who had been reviewing a US Department of Justice (DoJ) decision to allow CVS Health Corp to merge with health insurer Aetna said the agreement was legal under antitrust law, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs/u-s-judge-approves-cvs-purchase-of-insurer-aetna-idUSKCN1VP2WO\">Reuters</url>.</p><p>Judge Leon had been examining a government plan announced in October to allow the merger on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans. Both deals have already closed. Leon had initially balked at approving the merger conditions and insisted on hearing from critics of the deal, but finally decided to grant the motion to approve the consent agreement.</p><p>Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.</p><p>- The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-to-launch-google-facebook-antitrust-probes-11567762204?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">WSJ</url> reported that state attorneys general are formally launching separate antitrust probes into Facebook and Google. New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office was organizing a bipartisan, multi-state probe into Facebook. Joining in the Facebook investigation so far are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia, she said. The investigation will focus on Facebook's 'dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance,' her office said.</p><p>Separately, the Google probe is expected to be announced on Monday by a bipartisan group of roughly three dozen state attorneys general, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation will be led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, the people said.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment. Google, which is facing a DoJ antitrust probe, said it is co-operating with inquiries. 'Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,' a company spokesperson said.

But worry more about automation\u2019s threat to less skilled employees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each week, we review <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">the week\u2019s news</url>, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. For one last time before I leave The New York Times, here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story usually goes like this: Automation is going to take our jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the reality is far more nuanced, and debate rages about which jobs will be automated, at what scale and where. For the most part, one thing is agreed on: Blue-collar workers who perform repetitive work are most exposed.</p><p>That might not be quite right, though. A<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">study published by the Brookings Institution</url> on Wednesday looks at the degree to which professions are exposed to A.I. by comparing job descriptions with patent descriptions of new A.I. technologies, a method developed by the Stanford researcher Michael Webb. It found that A.I. will be \u201ca significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors and analysts,\u201d including those in relatively technical roles.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising finding: Holders of bachelor\u2019s degrees would be exposed to A.I. over five times more than workers with only a high school degree.</p><p>\u201cLots of math, science, technology and business roles involve, say, operating a power plant to maximize energy efficiency, or running an ad campaign to minimize cost per click,\u201d explained Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cAnd these are exactly the things that A.I. is best at.\u201d</p><p>Previously, similar studies lumped together robotics and A.I. But when they are picked apart, it makes sense that A.I. \u2014 which is about planning, perceiving and so on \u2014 would hit white-collar roles.</p><p>Still, workers needn\u2019t panic. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment, said A.I. was \u201cmore likely to complement people in those jobs rather than replacing them.\u201d And Mr. Muro points out that \u201cthese workers are frequently the ones that companies have already invested in\u201d and are likely to have been consulted about their futures.</p><p>Mr. Muro added: \u201cI for one am a bit less concerned about the white-collar folks than the less educated ones stuck in dead-end service work or the gig economy.\u201d</p><p>TikTok\u2019s Reboot</p><p>I recently explained how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">TikTok is in trouble</url> because the red-hot video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is under scrutiny from lawmakers in the United States. At the heart of this is a big, untested argument that Chinese laws could force TikTok, in theory, to send data to the Chinese government.</p><p>In an interview with The Times, TikTok\u2019s chief executive, Alex Zhu, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">tried to assuage Washington\u2019s fears</url>:</p><p>No, TikTok does not censor videos that displease China, he said. And no, it does not share user data with China, or even with its Beijing-based parent company.</p><p>Mr. Zhu said he\u2019d personally reject an appeal for data even if it came from President Xi Jinping.</p><p>And it\u2019s reportedly trying other stuff, too. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">The Wall Street Journal reported</url> that TikTok executives had discussed \u201crebranding it in the United States\u201d and \u201cexpanding operations in Southeast Asia, possibly Singapore \u2014 which would allow executives to distance the video-sharing app from China.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s unclear how far such assurances can go. </p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to assuage regulators in the U.S. without removing that ownership issue,\u201d Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me.</p><p>In the Times interview, Mr. Zhu said a sale of TikTok\u2019s American operations hadn\u2019t been discussed. But he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of ByteDance\u2019s reorganizing it as a separate company with a new board. It might not have much choice.</p><p>Disconnected Iran</p><p>Iran has demonstrated that it\u2019s willing to take its citizens offline \u2014 and, perhaps more worryingly, that it\u2019s able to do so without plunging domestic infrastructure into chaos.</p><p>The Iranian government recently imposed an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">almost complete nationwide internet blackout</url> that lasted for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">almost five days</url>. It came after protests erupted across the country after the government       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">said it would raise gasoline prices</url>. Amnesty International estimated that as many as 106 people were killed. </p><p>Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, explained to me in an email that the Iranian government was trying to limit the spread of evidence of state violence. </p><p>\u201cThe deaths and the ruthless images of authorities raining bullets on protesters that are being disseminated are not the images they want dominating their narrative,\u201d she said.</p><p>Blocking internet traffic and, by extension, social media certainly cuts information flows. But there\u2019s little evidence that internet blackouts undermine protests. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">2018 report by Human Rights Watch</url> found \u201cno substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.\u201d That Iran\u2019s blackout persisted, Ms. Alimardani said, was a strong indication that it had done little to calm the protests.</p><p>But the shutdown revealed one success for Iran\u2019s government: its National Information Network, a domestic, highly censored digital infrastructure. That infrastructure enabled the nation\u2019s critical services, such as finance and health care, to largely operate normally, demonstrating that the country is well equipped to shut down the public internet.</p><p>\u201cThey are proving they can and will cut people off if they question authorities again,\u201d Ms. Alimardani said.</p><p>Google\u2019s Staff Clash</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d it once said. But Google\u2019s internal mantra now looks like it could be more like: \u201cDon\u2019t question the management.\u201d</p><p>It has come to light that Google has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">ended its biweekly all-hands meetings</url>. The decision was made just days after Google employees       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">protested the interrogation of two colleagues</url> by the company\u2019s investigations team, according to CNBC. And it all comes on the back of a staff protest last year over the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment complaints, vibrant discussions on internal memo boards about company policies and pushback from some workers about Google\u2019s work in China and with the United States military.</p><p>Then, this past week, it transpired that Google had hired <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">an anti-union consulting firm to advise its management</url> as it deals with worker unrest.</p><p>It\u2019s still too early to tell how this will shake out at Google. But what\u2019s clear is that the company\u2019s traditional embrace of transparency and flexibility for workers is straining as more employees question its motives and actions.</p><p>Some Stories You Shouldn\u2019t Miss</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What caused Uber\u2019s autonomous car crash in 2018?

Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I\u2019m about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it\u2019s good that we keep discovering biased algorithms?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let\u2019s rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias.</p><p>First, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple\u2019s new credit card <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">may give higher limits to men</url> than to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were \u201cbased on a customer\u2019s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.\u201d</p><p>And my colleague Cade Metz<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported</url> that artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word \u201chers\u201d as a pronoun, but correctly identified \u201chis.\u201d Other, similar algorithms \u201cgenerally don\u2019t give women enough credit\u201d when analyzing text, he added.</p><p>This isn\u2019t surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased \u2014 and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences.</p><p>\u201cWhat algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror,\u201d Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. \u201cThey reflect the inequalities of our society.\u201d</p><p>That we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively.</p><p>The problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. \u201cHow many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?\u201d Professor Wachter asked. \u201cI often don\u2019t know that I\u2019m being treated unfairly.\u201d</p><p>In that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it\u2019s more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem.</p><p>Not that that\u2019s easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It\u2019s a slog, but it is happening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to assume that we\u2019ll ever have a neutral system,\u201d Professor Wachter said. \u201cBut with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases.\u201d</p><p>Banking With Big Tech</p><p>With that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech\u2019s push into personal finance.</p><p>Google announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">smart checking</url>\u201d account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers \u201cbenefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,\u201d via its Pay app.</p><p>Also, Facebook unveiled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">a digital payment system</url>, called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That\u2019s alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>This is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">investigate</url> the potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides because       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">people don\u2019t trust it</url>. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google\u2019s banking effort to CNBC: \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">There ought to be very strict scrutiny</url>.\u201d</p><p>But there\u2019s another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There\u2019s a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it\u2019s a high bar.</p><p>Hunger for Health Data</p><p>News surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company\u2019s patients \u2014 50 million in total \u2014 to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">uploaded to Google\u2019s cloud-computing platform</url>. Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded.</p><p>Ascension said it was exploring \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">machine-learning applications</url> that will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality\u201d through the deal. Google said it would provide \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">tools that Ascension could use</url> to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.\u201d</p><p>This may all be totally O.K. It\u2019s perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients\u2019 medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">to seek more information</url> about whether it complies with the law anyway.</p><p>Nonetheless, many people found it unnerving.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, readers! I\u2019m Farhad Manjoo, your technology columnist \u2014 and more important for our purposes today, I\u2019m a guy who has been to every Apple iPhone-unveiling event since the first one, all the way back in 2007. (If I were single, this would make a killer Tinder profile, right?)</p><p>As you might guess, then, I\u2019m sometimes a little jaded on iPhone day, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/technology/apple-event-live-iphone-watch-ios12.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">which took place again this week</url>. Apple showed off three new permutations of its smartphone at its newish spaceship headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. In its precise choreography \u2014 and after seeing it for the billionth time \u2014 Apple\u2019s rollout for its most important device can feel as formulaic as an episode of \u201cLaw &amp;amp; Order.\u201d Every year, the message is essentially the same: Amazingly, we\u2019ve somehow made an even better iPhone!</p><p>But I come to you today to praise rather than complain. Because this year, I did find myself getting a little out of my seat and my picture of the future expanded to include possibilities I hadn\u2019t considered viable before. For the first time in years, I was truly surprised.</p><p>There\u2019s just one catch: I felt this way about Apple\u2019s new watch, not its smartphone. The phones were fine. Apple\u2019s going to sell a lot of them and make a lot of money, as it does every year. But it\u2019s the watch that might change the future most arrestingly.</p><p>The big deal: The new Apple Watch packs a slew of sensors to make it a truly novel kind of wearable device \u2014 something like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d tricorder on your body. The new watch can administer a medically accurate electrocardiogram, a test of a person\u2019s heart rhythm that can help detect dangerous health conditions. It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.</p><p>One detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.</p><p>By themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.</p><p>They also suggest a new era in tech. For the last few years, \u201cwearables\u201d have been more of a gimmick than of any lasting utility. Apple itself has spent much time refining the watch to figure out its true purpose for people. At first, it thought of the device as a fashion accessory (the \u201cEdition\u201d version of the watch, which came in real precious metals and sold for $10,000 or more, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/12/17851918/apple-watch-edition-discontinued\">was discontinued this week</url>). But in the last few years, Apple has hit on a mission \u2014 health and fitness \u2014 and with these latest features, the company is setting itself on a path to create a device of lasting promise in people\u2019s daily lives.</p><p>It is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.</p><p>There was some other news in tech this week:</p><p>\u25a0 The spotlight on Google grew harsher. Breitbart, the right-wing outlet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/technology/leaked-google-video-trump.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">posted a leaked video</url> of a Google staff meeting that took place shortly after the 2016 presidential election. The contents aren\u2019t surprising: Google executives and employees were visibly shaken and horrified by Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory. Breitbart and many on the right took those political views as support for the notion that Google biases its search results against the right, a claim that President Trump has made repeatedly. The video added to political pressure on Google, which had escaped the scrutiny that fell on Facebook and Twitter after the election.</p><p>\u25a0 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and his wife, MacKenzie, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/technology/jeff-and-mackenzie-bezos-pledge-2-billion-for-homeless-and-preschoolers.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">pledged $2 billion</url> to fund initiatives for the homeless and for preschools. It\u2019s the first major foray into philanthropy for Mr. Bezos, who recently became the world\u2019s wealthiest man. It\u2019s hard to criticize someone who\u2019s giving money away, but it\u2019s worth noting that $2 billion isn\u2019t that much. Other billionaires have given away much more of their wealth \u2014 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has pledged $45 billion, which at the time was nearly all he was worth \u2014 and as Amazon\u2019s stock price keeps rising, Mr. Bezos, who is worth $164 billion, is likely to keep getting richer still.</p><p>And that\u2019s it, folks!

Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at this past week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/politics/ice-drivers-licenses-facial-recognition.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">analyzed millions of motorists\u2019 photos using facial recognition</url> without their knowledge outraged privacy advocates. And an outcry       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/detroit-facial-recognition-cameras.html?module=inline&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">erupted in Detroit</url> over the use of the technology on data from the city\u2019s prolific closed-circuit television system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Proponents of facial recognition by government and law enforcement argue that it\u2019s an important security tool. But critics keep getting louder and more numerous. They contend that facial recognition is a fundamental invasion of privacy and that it is inaccurate and often biased against minorities. They also argue that the longer it\u2019s used, the more entrenched it will become, making it harder to stop in the future.</p><p>\u201cI think this has created a perfect storm for people to realize that substantive change is required,\u201d said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Mr. Selinger, along with his colleague Woodrow Hartzog, last year called for an <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/s/story/facial-recognition-is-the-perfect-tool-for-oppression-bc2a08f0fe66\">outright ban on the use of the technology</url> by government and law enforcement. On Tuesday, the digital rights group Fight for the Future announced       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/\">its own push for an outright ban</url>.</p><p>But how realistic are such proposals?</p><p>There\u2019s some wind at their backs. Many lawmakers \u2014 from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio \u2014 think something must change.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for a timeout,\u201d Mr. Jordan said Tuesday on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/09/739809036/lawmakers-concerned-by-agents-use-of-drivers-licenses-to-track-migrants\">National Public Radio</url>. \u201cLet\u2019s figure out how we can put in safeguards that protect our fundamental liberties.\u201d</p><p>But in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://homeland.house.gov/activities/hearings/about-face-examining-the-department-of-homeland-securitys-use-of-facial-recognition-and-other-biometric-technologies\">House hearing</url> on Wednesday examining the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s use of facial recognition, some lawmakers rejected the idea of a ban. It would be \u201can easy way to avoid hard questions,\u201d said Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama.</p><p>Judith Donath of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard said arguments about security were \u201clikely to override\u201d concerns about the technology. And \u201cCongress has historically been reticent to influence state and local policing,\u201d said Alvaro Bedoya, director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.</p><p>If no full ban, though, then what?</p><p>Three routes stand out. First, a moratorium, like the one that civil rights advocates <url normalizedValue=\"https://epic.org/privacy/facerecognition/HSC-Letter-DHS-Suspension-FRT.pdf\">sought from the House Committee on Homeland Security</url> on Tuesday, when they asked for the Department of Homeland Security to \u201cimmediately suspend\u201d use of facial recognition.</p><p>Then there\u2019s a growing trend for local governments to introduce bans: San Francisco was the first city to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html\">restrict use of facial recognition</url> by city authorities, and then Somerville, Mass.,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/27/somerville-city-council-passes-facial-recognition-ban/SfaqQ7mG3DGulXonBHSCYK/story.html\">did something similar</url>. A quasi-national ban could bubble up if many more follow suit.</p><p>Professor Donath argues that it may be easier to regulate through limits on how facial recognition data can be collected, stored and used by law enforcement and government.</p><p>It looks increasingly as if Big Brother\u2019s gaze is destined to be limited. The questions now appear to be how, and by how much.</p><p>Are we thinking about 5G all wrong?</p><p>Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before: We\u2019re losing the 5G race to China, Huawei\u2019s dominance in the technology around the globe is a threat to national security, and we had better clamp down on it.</p><p>But Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/5g-in-five-not-so-easy-pieces/\">things were more nuanced</url>. It\u2019s a wide-ranging (often technical) analysis of the broader 5G policy landscape, and it\u2019s worth a read if you have the time.</p><p>I chatted with him about it, and here are a few of his points about the China situation that I thought were interesting:</p><p>\u25a0 Coming first may not be important. President Trump has said that \u201cthe race to 5G is a race that we must win,\u201d but it\u2019s not clear what that means. What might winning look like? \u201cThe U.S. wasn\u2019t first in any of the G\u2019s, and yet it\u2019s the dominant force in the wireless ecosystems,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cI believe that winning is dominance over the things that use the network,\u201d he added, as opposed to simply having the network in place first.</p><p>\u25a0 Railing against Huawei could undermine the United States\u2019 dominance. The Trump administration has been trying to cut off Huawei from American tech, most recently by blocking American companies from selling to it. (That has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/business/huawei-donald-trump.html\">softened a little</url>, but the effect is unclear.) \u201cMy concern is that these trade policies are forcing the Chinese to develop their own alternatives\u201d to United States technology, Mr. Wheeler said. The danger: that the resulting products and services are not just good but made widely available, and cheaply, too. \u201cThat will have an impact on our ability to lead,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said.</p><p>\u25a0 So, now what? \u201cThere is a need for a policy strategy,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to define winning, and then do it!\u201d</p><p>Killing software is hard</p><p>Imagine you wrote some software that you thought was kind of naughty but also interesting, and you then made it publicly available. Then people were like: Sure, interesting, but not naughty \u2014 intrusive, distasteful and dangerous.</p><p>So you decide to take it down!</p><p>Only, people who had downloaded it then uploaded it, putting it on code-hosting websites like GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft. Policing what is on those code-hosting sites is nearly impossible. Once software is published online, there\u2019s no getting it back, really, because there are so many corners of the web to put it in.</p><p>Anyway, The Verge <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687902/github-bans-deepnude-deepfakes-ai-nudity-app-copies\">wrote</url>:</p><p>GitHub is banning code from DeepNude, the app that used A.I. to create fake nude pictures of women. Motherboard, which first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzm59x/deepnude-app-creates-fake-nudes-of-any-woman\">reported on DeepNude</url> last month,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xzjpk/github-removed-open-source-versions-of-deepnude-app-deepfakes\">confirmed that</url> the Microsoft-owned software development platform won\u2019t allow DeepNude projects. GitHub told Motherboard that the code violated its rules against \u201csexually obscene content,\u201d and it\u2019s removed multiple repositories.</p><p>So, the horrors of nudifying A.I. are on the loose. Forever.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p>\u25a0 Twitter backed off a broad overhaul of its policies on speech, focusing on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/technology/twitter-ban-speech-dehumanizing.html?dlbk\">removing hate against religion</url> instead of all \u201cdehumanizing\u201d content.</p><p>\u25a0 Mr. Trump hosted a social media summit. Facebook and Twitter weren\u2019t invited, but a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/trump-social-media-summit.html?dlbk\">long line of pro-Trump influencers were</url>. How democratic!</p><p>\u25a0 Huawei\u2019s state ties remain under scrutiny. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3415726\">study</url> of leaked r\u00e9sum\u00e9s said there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of \u201ca deep and lasting relationship between Huawei, its employees and the Chinese state.\u201d</p><p>\u25a0 The Pentagon\u2019s cloud contract was hit by more controversy. The Wall Street Journal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagons-cloud-project-under-fire-as-award-nears-11562491802\">reported</url> on a 2017 meeting between Jim Mattis, who was the defense secretary, and an Amazon executive.</p><p>\u25a0 Zoom, a videoconferencing company, brushed off concerns about the security of its software for Macs, only to <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/work/1662473/zoom-video-steps-up-its-response-to-a-security-flaw-and-promises-a-patch/\">fix the issues after continued outcry</url>.</p><p>\u25a0 France\u2019s digital tax is in Mr. Trump\u2019s cross hairs.

Want this newsletter in your inbox?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/bits?emc=edit_tu_20171005&amp;nl=bits&amp;nlid=646676&amp;te=1&amp;module=inline\">Sign up here</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is your data worth $5 a month to tech companies? $20? More? How much would make you care?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An answer to the final question may come from a bill proposed by Senators Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri. Their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097245/Data-Value-Transparency-SIL19753\">bill</url> would require companies that collect user data to tell consumers and regulators what they collect, how they make money off it and how much it\u2019s worth \u2014 in aggregate and broken down by users.</p><p>\u201cThe overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they\u2019re giving up,\u201d Mr. Warner said in a statement.</p><p>Which is true. Seeming to acknowledge such concerns, Facebook announced changes to its terms of service a few days later, explaining how it makes money. \u201cBusiness and organizations pay us to show you ads,\u201d it said. \u201cWe use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you.\u201d (Unbelievably, it hadn\u2019t said that before. Sorry, you expected more?)</p><p>Less obvious is how much people care. As my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/opinion/congress-privacy-bill-internet.html\">Charlie Warzel wrote this past week</url>: \u201cWe don\u2019t always act in our own interests when it comes to our data. We\u2019ll even forgo monetary rewards to avoid thinking about privacy.\u201d</p><p>But I guess that\u2019s the point of the bill: to shock us into realizing of how much our data is worth.</p><p>So, how easy is it to work that out?</p><p>\u201cNot easy at all,\u201d said Robert Shapiro, the chairman of the economic advisory firm Sonecon, who has tried to do it himself.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.futuremajority.org/uploads/report-for-future-majority-on-the-value-of-people-s-personal-data-shapiro-aneja-march-8-2019.pdf\">approach</url>: Determine advertising revenue for some of the biggest American data collectors, work out the proportion attributed to targeted ads (about half,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3020503\">one recent study said</url>, based on 2015 data), and divide by the number of users. Using that approach, he found that in 2018, an average American\u2019s data was worth about $240, or $20 a month, to big tech companies, data brokers and other firms.</p><p>Mr. Warner is more cautious. In an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-josh-hawley-dashboard-tech-data-4ee575b4-1706-4d05-83ce-d62621e28ee1.html\">interview with Axios</url>, he pegged the figure at $5 a month.</p><p>The problem is, both sums sound insultingly small. The idea of increasing public awareness of the issue is great, but I worry that people might be underwhelmed, not outraged.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro said that his figure was probably an underestimate, because companies had become more sophisticated in their targeting of ads. And as companies grow, he said, the figure could rise to as much as $600 a year by 2022.</p><p>Would that be enough to make you care? What would? Tell me, at <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:jamie@nytimes.com\">jamie@nytimes.com</url>.</p><p>What\u2019s American?</p><p>Once, you could build a car in America using American designs and American steel and, very confidently, call it American.</p><p>But as products became more complicated, supply chains and intellectual property went global. So when the United States government moved to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/china-list-us-huawei-retaliate.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">block the sale of American products and services to Huawei</url> and other Chinese tech companies (a list that recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/us-china-trade-blacklist.html\">got longer</url>), many companies, even some outside the United States, quickly stopped selling, because determining what ran afoul of the rule was difficult.</p><p>But it has now been a month since the rule was announced, and it\u2019s clear that American companies don\u2019t want to leave all of the $11 billion Huawei spends with them every year on the table. So they scratched at the rule, and examined their supply chains, and decided that, actually, they could sell some stuff to Huawei. My colleagues Paul Mozur and Cecilia Kang reported on how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html?Dlbk\">Intel and Micron have sidestepped</url> the ban;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-tech-companies-find-ways-around-huawei-ban-11561517591\">The Wall Street Journal says Qualcomm has</url>, too.</p><p>How these companies determined that skirting the rule was O.K. is unclear, but the regulation says products can be shipped to Huawei if they are made in foreign countries and if the material in them that originated in the United States accounts for no more than 25 percent of their value. (\u201cMaterial\u201d means physical components, but also intellectual property.) Complex webs of foreign subsidiaries no doubt help make it easier to claim that material isn\u2019t American, too.</p><p>All of this underscores the difficulty facing the Trump administration: It can be hard to say a gadget is really American \u2014 or Chinese, or whatever \u2014 these days. So a tech Iron Curtain doesn\u2019t looking so impenetrable.</p><p>Small platform, big stance</p><p>Imagine you run a small social network where people discuss knitting. And you notice people increasingly discussing a non-knitting topic that you believe detracts from the network. You could just ban the topic, right?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/style/ravelry-knitting-ban-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Well</url>:</p><p>\u201cOn Sunday, Ravelry, a popular website for knitters and crocheters, took a political stand when it announced that it was banning content that supports President Trump, in what it said was a resolution against white supremacy.\u201d</p><p>Some users were \u2026 displeased? \u201cKill yourselves,\u201d one said. \u201cBoycott Ravelry,\u201d said another.</p><p>As a private social media platform, Ravelry isn\u2019t limited by free speech rights; it can go right ahead and take such a step. And it will probably weather the haters: It\u2019s a free service, so users have little recourse (apart from telling it to kill itself, or boycotting it), and most of its eight million users will probably accept it and keep knitting.</p><p>Expect more of this. Ravelry got the idea from another small social network, the role-playing game forum RPG.net. \u201cThere are very clear incentives for smaller platforms to take strong stances,\u201d Rasmus Nielsen, a professor of political communication at Oxford University, said in an email. That might be for product differentiation purposes, or to make an ideological stand for the community.</p><p>There\u2019s an interesting point about size here: Facebook is a private social media platform, just like Ravelry; it could ban topics and clean up problems overnight.</p><p>It won\u2019t, of course, because the backlash (and ad revenue hit) would be huge. As a society, we don\u2019t really want huge platforms like Facebook to turn into censors. (Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, reiterated at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado that he had no plans to do that, defending the need for free speech <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/zuckerberg-defends-free-speech-even-when-speech-false/\">even for factually incorrect statements</url>.)</p><p>\u201cThe tricky part is what gets to count as small and thus relatively unproblematic,\u201d Professor Nielsen said. \u201cRavelry clearly is. Is Twitter?\u201d</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p>\u25a0 Bitcoin enjoyed a sugar rush. It hit $13,880 on Wednesday, a 17-month high.

I\u2019m Nellie Bowles, the tech and culture reporter, here now with the roundup of the news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a week that captured the central issues of tech in 2020: privacy versus the convenience of smart home devices, dependence on the smooth running of China\u2019s manufacturing industry, battles over regulation in Europe and the lockdown on internal dissent at Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>So to those wanting to take a break from the endless Democratic primary jockeying, settle into a good chair, because what the week brought you is a basket of beautiful tech features.</p><p>We begin:</p><p>Coronavirus is starting to affect tech production lines and demand for products. Apple cut its sales expectations for the quarter, citing the virus\u2019s impact on factories and stores. The warning was a clear indication of how big the company has bet on China and how the impact of the outbreak might ripple out into the global economy, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">explored in an article by Daisuke Wakabayashi</url>.</p><p>Amazon executives are also preparing for coronavirus disruptions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">An article by Karen Weise and Michael Corkery</url> outlined the measures the company is taking to hedge against the potential that the impact of the virus gets worse. The Everything Store is \u201cmaking larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States,\u201d they wrote.</p><p>But at the same time, some suppliers are trying to lower demand, cutting back on advertising and promotions so they don\u2019t run out of stuff.</p><p>Privacy debates and doorbells</p><p>Speaking of Amazon: Not everyone agrees on where to draw the line between privacy and convenience, sometimes not even everyone in the same house. One couple fighting over whether to keep an Alexa-enabled Echo speaker in the home invented their own solution: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">a bracelet of silence that jams microphones</url>. Wear it and it\u2019s like smart-home armor. The tale of the couple, two computer science professors, was brought to us by Kashmir Hill.</p><p>But if you do agree on getting something that records video and listens \u2014 especially a Ring doorbell \u2014 there are some privacy best practices, which Brian X. Chen outlined in his latest Tech Fix column. There are many, many steps required, including getting a burner phone number. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">And his conclusion</url>: \u201cIf that all sounds like a lot of effort just to use a security camera, that\u2019s because the security concerns make Ring products impractical to own.\u201d</p><p>In Europe, leaders are very good at regulating technology, pioneering responses to issues of privacy and antitrust, but can it build tech giants of its own? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">My colleagues Adam Satariano and Monika Pronczuk wrote</url>: \u201cAs Europe has created a reputation as the world\u2019s most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust.\u201d Now it is trying to change that and reclaim \u201ctechnological sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley companies have been making more trips to Brussels recently to lobby against some of that regulation: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies</url>, Adam wrote.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/apple-coronavirus-economy.html\">Noam Scheiber and Kate Conger had a big story</url> in the The New York Times Magazine on the Great Google Revolt: what happened when a group of employees tried to make the company stop doing work they saw as unethical.Mostly, they were fired.

My name is Natasha Singer. I\u2019m a technology reporter covering privacy and other thorny industry issues for The New York Times. I\u2019ll be bringing you the week\u2019s tech news. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, a data rights update: As the holidays approach, some families may be counting down the days to Christmas with Advent calendars. Many tech companies, on the other hand, are counting the days they still have left to figure out how to comply with a sweeping new law, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">the California Consumer Privacy Act</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, will give Californians the right to see, delete and stop the sale of the personal information that companies have compiled about them.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">new law applies to businesses</url> operating in California that collect personal information for commercial purposes and meet certain conditions \u2014 like collecting the data of 50,000 people or more. That means it will cover scores of tech companies, app developers, websites, mobile service providers, streaming TV services \u2014 as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, drugstores and many other businesses.</p><p>The effort has national implications. Companies like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Microsoft have said they will honor</url> the data rights in the California law for customers nationwide.</p><p>To prepare for consumers seeking to exercise those new data rights, many companies told me they have had to restructure the way they handle users\u2019 information. It\u2019s not Y2K. It\u2019s YCCPA.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent the last week talking to tech executives and legal experts about a few parts of the law that are so new to the United States that many companies are still working out how to comply with them. </p><p>The California law gives individuals a new right to see the specific pieces of information that companies have compiled about them. That includes inferences and categorizations \u2014 Status Seeking Singles, Blue Collar Comfort, Tight Money \u2014 that some companies use to classify people.</p><p>Does this mean Uber and Lyft will now be obliged to provide riders in California who request their personal data with a list of all the passenger ratings drivers give them after each ride? Will Amazon be required to give Prime customers detailed activity logs of their streaming video use? Will smart-mattress companies have to show sleepers moment-by-moment records of their tossing and turning?</p><p>\u201cYes, they have to come back with the specific pieces of personal information,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Mary Stone Ross, a technology consultant</url>who helped write the ballot initiative that led California to enact the law. \u201cSo if they\u2019re collecting that, your sleep information, they have to respond with it.\u201d</p><p>The California law\u2019s definition of \u201cselling\u201d personal information includes sharing it for nonmonetary compensation. And the law requires companies \u201cselling\u201d personal information to give consumers the choice to opt out of having their data sold or shared for commercial gain.</p><p>Will much of the digital advertising industry, like apps that share user data in exchange for targeted ads, now be obliged to offer consumers a way to opt out?</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of information exchanges going on in the economy where people don\u2019t pay with cash but there\u2019s some kind of consideration for it,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Lothar Determann, a lawyer</url> at Baker McKenzie who specializes in privacy regulation, told me. \u201cAnd all of that is to some extent covered by this very overbroad law.\u201d (Mr. Determann said he was speaking generally, not about any particular company.)</p><p>The law gives employees in the state some new rights related to the data their employers collect about them. How does this change business as usual?</p><p>Until now, Mr. Determann said, employees in the United States typically received \u201ca notice saying that \u2018you shall not have any privacy expectations at the workplace \u2014 we record and monitor everything for compliance and harassment, trade secret protection purposes,\u2019 and so on. So they were getting antiprivacy notices.\u201d</p><p>But as of Jan. 1, he said, employers in California must give contractors and employees a notice explaining the types of information the company collects about them and for what purpose. That is, he said, \u201csomething that employers in the U.S. never had to do.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll be following these new employer data disclosures. So please email me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nsinger@nytimes.com\">nsinger@nytimes.com</email> or DM me <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">@natashanyt</url> if you work in California, have already received your employer\u2019s disclosure and want to share it.</p><p>Some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">tech companies say the new privacy law</url> is too broad and prescriptive. Microsoft said it would like to see an even more comprehensive privacy regime. How so?</p><p>\u201cCalifornia is a good first step because it has some very important rights built in around user control,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Julie Brill, Microsoft\u2019s chief privacy officer</url>, told me. \u201cBut too much of a burden has been placed on individuals. We need to ensure that companies share the burden to protect individual data in the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means things like requiring companies to assess the data that they have and to make sure that they\u2019re adequately protecting it,\u201d she added. \u201cIt should include privacy by design. Good stewardship requirements should also include principles like data minimization.\u201d</p><p>Silicon Valley is not alone in having to contend with a new data rights law. As my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Vindu Goel reported this past week</url>, India is set to enact data protection regulations that would give its population of 1.3 billion people some controls over their information.</p><p>The Indian data bill is an outgrowth of a Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to privacy in the country in 2017. Yet the effort is contentious.</p><p>The proposed law would give Indians more power over the details that companies compile on them. But it would also \u201cplace fewer restrictions on the government\u2019s own use of sensitive data on its residents,\u201d Vindu wrote, \u201cwhich include the fingerprint and iris scans that are part of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Aadhaar national ID system</url>and its detailed surveys of who receives government benefits in every household.\u201d</p><p>2020 is shaping up to be a very interesting year as American tech giants face an increasingly balkanized landscape of data protection regimes in different countries and, if other states enact versions of California\u2019s privacy law, at home as well. We\u2019ll be covering industry efforts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">push Congress to pass a federal law</url> to standardize company obligations \u2014 and override some of the data rights that Californians have just gained.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A number of high-profile foundations \u2014 including the Ford Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Economic Security Project</url>, led by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes \u2014 are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">financing an antitrust movement</url> against Big Tech, my colleague David McCabe reported.

Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How much trust does a company need among its customers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s clearly not essential. A lot of people don\u2019t trust Uber to look after its drivers or Amazon to pay taxes, but they still use their services.</p><p>It can often come down to a judgment call. With Facebook, until now, that has been: Do you trust it with your data enough to use the service? And for most people, the answer is still (just about) yes.</p><p>Soon you may have another: Do you trust Facebook with your cash and transaction history enough to use it for a bank?</p><p>The company on Tuesday unveiled plans for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/technology/facebook-cryptocurrency-libra.html\">a new cryptocurrency called Libra</url>. Due to be in use next year, the digital token\u2019s value would be tied to traditional currencies like the dollar or euro to keep it stable.</p><p>It would initially be used for money transfers. But one day, the company hopes, it will lead to other financial services, like loans and credit. And ultimately, Facebook would like it to become a universal digital currency for the internet.</p><p>Many people\u2019s first taste of Libra would be through Facebook\u2019s own financial platform, Calibra, whose app and integration with Messenger and WhatsApp could allow billions of users to make and receive payments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we have the prospect of a cryptocurrency being accessible to so many people,\u201d said Michel Rauchs, a cryptocurrency expert at the Center for Alternative Finance at Cambridge University.</p><p>This could be Facebook\u2019s lifeboat if targeted ad revenues decline in the privacy-focused future that the company is pursuing in the wake of its data scandals.</p><p>Libra could allow Facebook to become intimately intertwined with the e-commerce industry, noted Rajesh Kandaswamy, an analyst at Gartner. From that, it could skim a healthy cut. It could also win part of the financial transactions market in developing countries.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Facebook is doing what it can to gain trust for the initiative. It says it will vest control of the currency to members of the so-called Libra Foundation, which already comprises 27 companies like Visa, Mastercard, eBay, PayPal and Uber, so it will have only limited influence on how it works. And its privacy document is surprisingly extensive.</p><p>But there\u2019s no escaping the deep links to Facebook. The underpinning technology has been created entirely by the company. Its staff put together the Libra Foundation. Most people will experience it on the company\u2019s platforms.</p><p>Scratch at the documentation that describes Libra, and there\u2019s more to be skeptical about. Its promise to diffuse control \u2014 at some point in the future \u2014 relies on technology that is not yet developed. And its privacy promise says Calibra would not share financial data with Facebook except in \u201climited cases,\u201d but that seems to provide plenty of wiggle room.</p><p>It\u2019s not just journalists looking for holes: Regulators and lawmakers are skeptical, too. The Senate Banking Committee <url normalizedValue=\"http://nyt.et.e.sparkpost.com/f/a/tW8qivkkIQE_Le8a2FnQ9w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRe7eT1P0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS91cy1mYWNlYm9vay1jcnlwdG8tc2VuYXRlLWlkVVNLQ04xVEsyU1g_dGU9MSZubD1kZWFsYm9vayZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ka18yMDE5MDYyMD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD00Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTEwMzQ5JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTQ0NzUmdXNlcl9pZD1mNDU0MmE5OTI4Mzc3ZDI0MDIxMjEzZGM1MmI2MGQ2NiZyZWdpX2lkPTc5NjI5MTYxMjAxOTA2MjBXA255dEIKABv1XwtdTxJMQlIZamFtaWUuY29uZGxpZmZlQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\">plans to scrutinize</url>Libra at a July 16 hearing. And the Group of 7 nations is apparently planning to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nyt.et.e.sparkpost.com/f/a/12TZDrnP638AAGx1fp2b2g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRe7JT7P0TYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvNTUzNWZiM2EtOTFlYS0xMWU5LWI3ZWEtNjBlMzVlZjY3OGQyP3RlPTEmbmw9ZGVhbGJvb2smZW1jPWVkaXRfZGtfMjAxOTA2MTk_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9NCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0xMDMyMCZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTE0NDM5JnVzZXJfaWQ9ZjQ1NDJhOTkyODM3N2QyNDAyMTIxM2RjNTJiNjBkNjYmcmVnaV9pZD03OTYyOTE2MTIwMTkwNjE5VwNueXRCCgAg-w8KXfsfGHdSGWphbWllLmNvbmRsaWZmZUBnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">investigate so-called stablecoins like Libra</url> and how they will affect financial stability and money laundering.</p><p>Such concerns are obviously heightened by Facebook\u2019s data privacy and election interference scandals. And now, it will ask users to accept all that and still trust it with their money and transaction records. Libra\u2019s success \u2014 maybe even Facebook\u2019s \u2014 may depend on it.</p><p>So, back to that question: How much trust does a company need among its customers? We\u2019re about to find out.</p><p>Big Tech\u2019s censorship headache</p><p>Feel aggrieved that a social network took down your post? Why not sue, claiming that the company provides a digital public square that\u2019s protected by First Amendment free-speech rights?</p><p>That\u2019s increasingly a concern for big tech companies, as demand for takedowns of troubling content swells. They had been holding their breath for the outcome of a seemingly unrelated court case about cable TV that could have made dealing with the problem harder.</p><p>The Manhattan Neighborhood Network disciplined two contributors after a film received complaints for allegedly inciting violence. The contributors sued, claiming that MNN violated their First Amendment rights.</p><p>If the contributors prevailed and a ruling was vague enough, it could have left the tech companies open to being sued, too. Even the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group that frequently criticizes Big Tech\u2019s content moderation, thought it could be problematic.</p><p>\u201cIf you force platforms to not moderate speech at all, you have a free-for-all online,\u201d Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the foundation, said. \u201cThere are benefits to moderated platforms,\u201d she continued \u2014 say, to create coherent, niche communities.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18682099/supreme-court-ruling-first-amendment-social-media-public-forum\">5-to-4 decision</url> this past Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that MNN couldn\u2019t face the lawsuits. Merely providing a forum for speech wasn\u2019t enough to open an organization up to free-speech rights.</p><p>So, Big Tech dodged a bullet. But later in the week, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/449241-gop-senator-introduces-bill-to-hold-online-platforms-liable-for-political\">proposed a bill</url> that would dent immunity of social media platforms from liability for illegal content posted by users. The new bill would demand that companies prove their content-removal practices were \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d to maintain immunity.</p><p>The tech industry wasn\u2019t thrilled. \u201cThis bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice: Either host reprehensible but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism,\u201d Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.</p><p>Senator Hawley\u2019s bill is unlikely to become law. But it underscores the narrow line that social media companies have to walk as they balance free speech, moderation, regulation and legal action.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p>\u25a0 The United States has been hacking Russia\u2019s power grid. The Trump administration used new authority to deploy potentially crippling malware <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html\">deep inside the Russian systems</url>.</p><p>\u25a0 YouTube is being <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/technology/youtube-child-privacy.html?te=1&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dk_20190620?campaign_id=4&amp;instance_id=10349&amp;segment_id=14475&amp;user_id=f4542a9928377d24021213dc52b60d66&amp;regi_id=7962916120190620\">investigated by the Federal Trade Commission</url> over video for kids. There\u2019s a chance of a fine for the way YouTube collected data about children and allowed them to see harmful content. The company has been weighing changes to the way it handles children\u2019s videos.</p><p>\u25a0 You don\u2019t want to work at a Facebook moderation center. At its worst-performing such sites in North America, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">one contractor has died at his desk</url> and conditions are often unsanitary.</p><p>\u25a0 Slack went public. After Slack listed its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange, they began trading on Thursday at $38.50, valuing the company at $23.1 billion \u2014 more than triple the $7.1 billion valuation from its last funding round.</p><p>\u25a0 Huawei predicts a huge hit from President Trump\u2019s attacks. Sales expectations <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/technology/huawei-trump.html\">fell to $100 billion</url> for this year and next, from estimates of $125 billion for this year, after the company was blacklisted from trading with American businesses.</p><p>\u25a0 Google pledged to help ease the San Francisco housing crisis.

This week, we bring you the latest UK tech investment news, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella's privacy boast and much more. Fuse Universal lands $20mEdTech company Fuse Universal raised $20m (14.79m) in growth capital from Eight Roads Ventures[1] to grow its workplace learning platform. Fuse Universal has built a platform for employees to take part in shared learning, knowledge and communication tasks. </p><p>The platform can function alone as an individual learning management system ('LMS') or integrate with existing providers. Since it launched in 2011, Fuse now works with over 100 enterprises including, EY, The Prince's Trust, Spotify,Vodafone and more. Recruiters, here's some key advice to help you find the best tech talent The company will use this fresh funding to advance its work in areas such as machine learning and augmented reality. It will also be used to support global expansion and to accelerate its charity arm, FuseSchool. Trussle's 13.6m Series BTrussle, a UK-based online mortgage broker, landed[2] 13.6m in a Series B round led by Goldman Sachs' investment arm, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategic Investments. San Francisco-based Propel Venture Partners, Finch Capital and Seedcamp[3]- which has invested in companies such as TransferWise[4] and Revolut[5] -also contributed. This funding follows a period of high growth for the company. Since it was founded in 2016, the company has gone from employing 14 to 70 people. Why meetings won't die. EVER It offers a mortgage monitoring service, which constantly monitors the market and alerts a customer when money could be saved by switching to another deal.Airsorted crowdfunds millions'Hassle-free hosting' firm Airsorted upped its total funding amount by raising 2.1m[6], through a crowdfunding campaign on Seedrs. This fresh money injection will be added to the 5m that Airsorted raised from investors Atami Capital, Concentric, Maxfield Capital and Pi Labs back in March 2018. With the 7m in total, Airsorted aims to expand into 38 new cities globally, by the end of 2019. It will also be used to develop its automation technology, including smart scheduling, chatbot and API integrated channel management. Startup investor L Marks expands into US to foster innovation in the Midwest Airsorted was founded in 2015 by ex-Airbnb host James Jenkins-Yates, and offers services to hosts including professional photography, maintenance and laundry, restocking of household items and 24/7 guest support.Satya Nadella positions Microsoft as privacy championsMicrosoft boss Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on trust and privacy[7], whilst speaking at Build, Microsoft's annual developer conference in Seattle. He said:'Privacy is a human right. We at Microsoft have enshrined a set of principles that ensure we protect this human right.'Privacy is a hot topic at the moment; following the Cambridge Analytica scandal[8] and with GDPR[9] coming into force later this month. Nadella said he was a fan of the upcoming data protection regulation. He noted: 'We have a responsibility as the tech industry to build trust in technology' and cautioned companies' about building AI without considering the ethics. In a separate interview with CNBC, he argued that trust rather than better technology in Microsoft's cloud platform will set it apart from Amazon's AWS and Google Cloud; saying that the two tech giants are 'fantastic at being able to rig transactions'.Facial recognition software comes up shortIn other news, The Guardian[10] revealed that facial recognition software used by the South Wales Police force incorrectly identified 2,000 people as potential criminals during the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff. The force have defended the use of the technology, saying that no such software can be 100% effective, but it has resulted in 450 correct arrests since they started trialling the tech back in June 2017. The tech works by scanning faces in a crowd and comparing them against a database of custody images. The force blamed the high number of false positives at the football final on 'poor quality images'.Google's virtual assistant can make phone callsGoogle made headlines this week after it unveiled a new functionality which sees its virtual assistant make phone calls on behalf of users. The robotic assistant, which has a life-like voice, can schedule appointments, make reservations and get holiday hours. Surprisingly, the assistant's speech includes natural affirmations and hesitations such as 'er' and 'mmmhmm', making it difficult for the other person at the end of the phone to distinguish it from a real human's voice. The feature will be released to the public later this year and leverages a technology called Google Duplex. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, showed off the functionality on stage during the tech giant's annual developer conference, I/O.Startup investor L Marks' expansionLast but not least, early-stage investor L Marks has announced its expansion into the US[11]. The London-based company has opened a new operations centre in Columbus, Ohio to try and establish the Midwest as a hub of innovation. This expansion comes just a month after L Marks announced it was launching in Japan. The aim is to pursue innovative tech startups in the US market, as the area is home to headquarters including retail companies like Abercrombie ...tch, Victoria's Secret and Wendy's. This US expansion comes alongside the launch of the BMW Financial Services US Collaboration Lab 2018; as part of a partnership which was announced earlier this year.

I cover technology and economics for The New York Times, and I\u2019m this week\u2019s tour guide through recent tech news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the big stories of the year has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">the Big Tech companies becoming targets</url>of major antitrust investigations by the nation\u2019s federal enforcement agencies, Congress and states. The concern is not only the companies\u2019 market power but also how they handle personal data, spread disinformation and amplify partisan divisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To someone who has covered technology and antitrust for The Times for more than two decades, this period seems different than anything I\u2019ve seen before. To me, it raises a question: Are we entering a new, progressive era in antitrust?</p><p>The answer to that question matters a lot. The official scrutiny of the big tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple \u2014 is just getting underway. Whether it results in meaningful curbs on the companies will depend in good part on the persistence of the investigators.</p><p>Investigations have a way of finding things. And the institutional commitment to antitrust, or lack of it, will be shaped by economics, ideas, politics and public opinion.</p><p>There are intriguing parallels with the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">growing gaps in wealth</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">concentration of markets</url> and a perceived threat to democracy.</p><p>Then, the technology engine was the industrial revolution. Today, it is the digital revolution. Then, the targets of enforcement were the industrial trusts, led by Standard Oil. Today, it is the digital behemoths. Then, the policy response was new antitrust laws \u2014 the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914 \u2014 and aggressive enforcement. Today, the policy response remains to be seen.</p><p>While reporting recent stories and a few interviews last week, I\u2019ve been struck by two things: the very different climate now compared with the one surrounding the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, and the extent of the bipartisan support for pursuing the big tech companies.</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Microsoft investigation</url> and trial, which I covered, was fairly narrowly focused. It was about market dominance and the software giant\u2019s tactics to stifle innovation.</p><p>The second half of the 1990s, when the Justice Department and a group of states investigated and then filed a major antitrust suit against Microsoft, were banner years economically. It was not only a period of strong overall growth but a time when productivity rose. For a few years, income gaps narrowed.</p><p>Microsoft was a purely economic case. \u201cBut now we\u2019re seeing an evolution in antitrust, to take in greater social and political concerns, as well as economics,\u201d said<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Maurice Stucke</url>, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law. \u201cAntitrust is starting to capture the public imagination in a way that Microsoft never did.\u201d</p><p>Current antitrust thinking is expanding to take in matters like the control of data and privacy. Since the 1980s, a central focus of antitrust has been a dominant company\u2019s power to increase prices. But there is a lively debate now about so-called nonprice components of competition. A loss of privacy to a data-harvesting giant like Facebook or Google, for example, can be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">cast as reducing the quality of the service</url> and thus as a signal of monopoly power.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s free,\u201d Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said at the Times\u2019s DealBook conference last month. \u201cIf consumers think they\u2019re getting any service for free, they\u2019re being misled.\u201d</p><p>Data, Mr. Delrahim explained, is an asset for internet companies, and gathering and analyzing large amounts of personal data is not necessarily a problem. But digital data, he added, \u201ccan give you market power. And its abuse would be a violation of antitrust law.\u201d</p><p>In the last couple of weeks, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, who is the ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been a fixture on cable TV news as a hyperventilating, partisan opponent of impeachment. But in an interview last month for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">an article on a Judiciary subcommittee\u2019s antitrust investigation</url> of the big tech companies, Mr. Collins was a voice of bipartisan reason.</p><p>Mr. Collins is less critical of the tech giants than the Democrat leading the inquiry, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. And he dismisses the calls to break up the companies from the Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.</p><p>But Mr. Collins supports the House investigation. And he thinks that consumers should be given greater control over how the tech giants use their data and that the companies should be prevented from buying up nascent competitors. \u201cThose are genuine concerns of mine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Barry Lynn, executive director of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Open Markets Institute</url>, a research and advocacy group, points to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">the states\u2019 investigation of Google</url>, joined by 50 attorneys general and led by Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican attorney general in Texas, as a sign of the changing times in antitrust.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">An investigation of Facebook</url>, led by Letitia James, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, has nearly as many supporting states.</p><p>\u201cThe environment is radically different than it was even a year or two ago,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a grass-roots rebellion against concentrated power.\u201d</p><p>But whether shifting sentiments will translate to a pendulum swing in antitrust, reminiscent of the progressive era of a century ago, is uncertain at best.

I report on tech policy from The Times\u2019s bureau in Washington. But this past week, one of the biggest stories began with an announcement an ocean away.</p><p>For weeks, we had been waiting to see whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson would allow Huawei equipment to be used in Britain\u2019s 5G wireless network or follow American officials in shutting the company out. The United States has said for years that the company\u2019s networking gear could give the Chinese government access to key infrastructure.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">revealed his decision</url>: Huawei is in. The company\u2019s equipment can be used in a portion of the 5G, or fifth-generation, network.</p><p>This is a big setback for the Trump administration\u2019s global anti-Huawei push. The White House had sent top officials to London to try to sway Mr. Johnson, a close ally. Shortly after the British announcement, the European Union <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">told its members</url> to limit but not totally eliminate Huawei\u2019s role in their network.</p><p>I messaged Adam Satariano, who covers tech in Europe from The Times\u2019s London bureau, to find out more about the fallout from Mr. Johnson\u2019s choice.</p><p>Why did Boris Johnson make the decision to allow Huawei to stay involved in building Britain\u2019s 5G network, despite all the pressure he was under from the Trump administration?</p><p>There are a few key reasons. First, a practical one. Huawei has been part of the British telecom network for years. 5G will be built on top of that existing system. To implement a ban now would be extraordinarily costly and delay the rollout of the faster network because a lot of that old kit would have to be ripped out.</p><p>Second, British intelligence and cybersecurity officials believe the risks of Huawei can be mitigated. As part of allowing Huawei to be part of its network, British officials years ago required the company to subject its products and code to tests. There\u2019s a lab near Cambridge where this is done. For British officials, this gives them a level of confidence that the problem can be managed. Of course, American officials think this is wishful thinking. With 5G, software plays a much bigger role, meaning it will be harder to keep harmful code from slipping through.</p><p>Finally, as Britain exits the European Union, it can\u2019t afford to alienate China, which is a big investor in the country and a growing buyer of British exports. From an economic standpoint, it would be a big risk. Britain also sees 5G as a key to the country\u2019s economic future, and any delays could put it at a disadvantage to other countries.</p><p>Here in Washington, Mr. Johnson\u2019s decision set off a paroxysm of concerned statements from the administration and hawkish members of Congress. What has the reaction been like in Britain?</p><p>I think it was expected. The statement from the White House was actually quite mild. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still went forward with a trip to Britain during the week. Perhaps harsher words were shared behind closed doors.</p><p>This Huawei decision is also just one example of a split between how tech is regulated in the United States and in Britain. What\u2019s the future of the special relationship when it comes to tech?</p><p>Complicated. Like many countries in Europe, Britain is very frustrated with Big Tech. It doesn\u2019t think the companies pay their fair share in taxes. And with Facebook and Google/YouTube, not enough is done to limit the spread of harmful content. Attempts to address taxes and harmful content will gain momentum this year, potentially setting up more tension with the United States.</p><p>It\u2019s late in London, so I\u2019ve got just one more: You cover all of Europe, not just Britain. Where does the American campaign to keep Huawei out of 5G networks go next?</p><p>Germany is another country where the United States has been applying a lot of pressure. But as our colleagues Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">recently reported</url>, it also faces a tough decision. China has threatened to retaliate if Huawei is banned. That is not an insignificant threat for Germany, which sells a lot of BMWs and VWs to China. Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled she doesn\u2019t want a ban, but she is facing pressure from others in government who want to take a more aggressive approach.</p><p>It\u2019s a fascinating issue, touching on tech, trade, politics, foreign policy and national security.</p><p>How tech is shaping the coronavirus story</p><p>Three stories during the week underscored how the news around the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China \u2014 and the way the public has responded \u2014 is being mediated by online platforms.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Times\u2019s Raymond Zhong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported</url> from Shanghai on the way that anger over the Chinese government\u2019s handling of the outbreak has boiled over on social media.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Not surprisingly, the virus has also been the subject of online disinformation.

Debate over political ads, privacy and the market power of the biggest companies were again front and center. And Facebook, the biggest target of criticism, picked up where it left off at the end of last year.</p><p>Hi, I\u2019m Cecilia Kang. I write for The New York Times about the tech industry\u2019s often fraught relationship with the regulators and lawmakers of Washington.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s tough week kicked off with a Times report on an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">internal company post</url> by Andrew Bosworth, a senior executive of Facebook and a self-described liberal, who warned against actions that could thwart President Trump in the 2020 election.</p><p> The post, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">obtained by Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac</url>, was a winding, 2,500-word essay in defense of the social network and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s stance on free expression \u2014 including misinformation \u2014 in political speech.</p><p>The post from Mr. Bosworth, known as Boz and one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s closest lieutenants, didn\u2019t sit well with many employees who had grown uncomfortable with the company\u2019s hands-off approach. Other big social media companies, notably Twitter and Google, have set limits or banned political ads outright. </p><p>Mr. Bosworth admitted Facebook probably helped elect Mr. Trump. But he said it was not for the reasons critics said. It wasn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s reckless handling of data, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of voters, that did it. It was Facebook\u2019s platform for targeted advertising that was so influential in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, he said, used that platform better than anyone.</p><p>Alexis Madrigal of The Atlantic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">explained why</url> Mr. Bosworth\u2019s internal post was so divisive in \u201cWhy Facebook\u2019s Id is showing.\u201d Mr. Bosworth argued that Facebook did not really need to change. After all, it\u2019s not tobacco, he said. It\u2019s more like sugar \u2014 not so bad if you don\u2019t consume too much of it.</p><p>The next day, Facebook was caught up in an odd kerfuffle over a glowing article about five Facebook managers charged with defeating disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. The article, oddly, appeared in Teen Vogue without a byline. Why was Teen Vogue publishing an uncritical look at Facebook\u2019s election integrity efforts?</p><p>It got weirder. A label was added that tagged the story as \u201csponsored\u201d editorial. Then the label disappeared. Then the story disappeared. </p><p>I dug into the mystery <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">with my colleague Rachel Abrams</url>. The article was, in fact, a piece of paid content. Teen Vogue and Facebook both said the labeling fracas was all a big misunderstanding.</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook was back to serious news: It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">released its policy on political ads</url>, cementing a decision to allow lies by politicians to go unchecked and for campaigns to micro-target those ads to specific audiences.</p><p>The reaction was swift and partisan. The Trump campaign lauded the policy and other Republicans said it was an affirmation of free speech. Democrats, including the leading member of the Federal Election Commission, were angry, and said the decision was nothing short of a threat to democracy.</p><p>Will the encryption fight be rebooted?</p><p>The F.B.I. and Apple have reignited their battle over encryption. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">As reported by Jack Nicas and Katie Benner</url>, the F.B.I. asked Apple for the data on two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">shooting last month at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla.</url>, possibly setting up another showdown over law enforcement\u2019s access to smartphones.</p><p>This is an old battle, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">covered almost three years ago</url> by Katie and Matt Apuzzo, now a European investigative reporter for The Times. At the heart of the dispute is a disagreement over user privacy and national security, and we\u2019ll be watching closely how this plays out.</p><p>Sonos takes Google to court</p><p>Antitrust enforcement of Big Tech will be a central focus for Washington regulators. And competitors are taking notice. Sonos sued Google in two federal courts. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported by Jack Nicas and Daisuke Wakabayashi</url>, the speaker company claims Google stole its secrets and used its market dominance to develop lower-priced speakers to squash competition. </p><p>The case has the attention of a congressional committee investigating competition violations by Big Tech. Next Friday, the antitrust subcommittee of the House plans to take a road trip to Boulder, Colo., where Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos, is expected testify.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A cybersecurity company in Israel found <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">major security flaws in the TikTok app</url>.

And I\u2019m here to let you in on a sad truth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sometimes news breaks that is more exciting or terrifying or compelling for whatever reason than our beautiful articles about tech. Maybe the article was a long feature that came out right after the impeachment vote. Maybe it was a carefully wrought profile that coincided with Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death. Whatever the reason, when there is big, surprising news, there is always, in some other corner of The Times, a reporter quietly heartbroken over the realization that her or his article is now at the bottom of the heap. </p><p>So in this newsletter, I will quickly run down the news of a slow news week (it\u2019s New Year\u2019s!). And then we will take a tour through the hidden gems produced by my co-workers in 2019. </p><p>The Week\u2019s Recap </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Brian Chen</url> laid out what new tech to expect in 2020 (better home automation, more wearables). And       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Kevin Roose</url> chose his annual Good Tech Award winners.</p><p>California\u2019s new law to regulate freelance work <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">is upsetting a lot of freelancers</url>, as I reported with my colleague Noam Scheiber, who followed with news that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Uber and Postmates filed a lawsuit</url> to stop it. A new California law on privacy is also creating dismay, though in a different way: Few companies agree on what the law means,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Natasha Singer wrote</url>. </p><p>SoftBank, famous these days for its investments in overhyped start-ups, faces trouble in India for funding Oyo, a start-up with a noxious work environment, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">Vindu Goel and Karan Deep Singh wrote</url>.</p><p>The Hidden Gems From 2019 </p><p>The day after Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony, Steve Lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concern <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">but a wealth and power concentration concern</url>, too. </p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>The morning after the House impeachment vote, Karen Weise published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">an investigation</url> into how Amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.</p><p>\u201cSome guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, \u2018We have changed the rules,\u2019\u201d said Charlie Cole, who runs Tumi\u2019s online business. He pushed back, but wasn\u2019t successful. \u201cIt was like talking to a brick wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to be able to control everything.\u201d</p><p>Cade Metz<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">went to Bhubaneswar, India</url>, to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. He wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless. </p><p>In facilities like the one I visited in Bhubaneswar and in other cities in India, China, Nepal, the Philippines, East Africa and the United States, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.</p><p>Jack Nicas and Keith Collins <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">exposed</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">the way Apple\u2019s algorithms</url> kept Apple services ranked high in the App Store. Midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. Apple representatives told Jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors. </p><p>If you searched for \u201cpodcast\u201d in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.</p><p>Just as the holidays were kicking off, Adam Satariano had a tale from the Faroe Islands, \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">At the Edge of the World, a New Battleground for the U.S. and China.</url>\u201d The photos by Ben Quinton are especially stunning. </p><p>No location is now too small for the United States and China to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. The Faroe Islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across Europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over Huawei, the crown jewel of the Chinese tech sector.</p><p>Davey Alba, the tech team\u2019s new reporter on disinformation, wrote about how Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">It didn\u2019t happen</url> as promised.</p><p>As a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.</p><p>During summer\u2019s long vacation-filled months, Brian Chen wrote a confessional: \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">I Shared My Phone Number. I Learned I Shouldn\u2019t Have.</url>\u201d</p><p>For most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. In August, I learned this was a bad idea.</p><p>Natasha Singer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">profiled Baroness Beeban Kidron</url>, a member of Britain\u2019s House of Lords who is fighting Big Tech on behalf of children\u2019s privacy.</p><p>\u201cThe idea that it\u2019s O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons \u2014 it\u2019s not a fair fight,\u201d Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. \u201cIt\u2019s little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.\u201d</p><p>And last but not least, Daisuke Wakabayashi <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">profiled</url> Luigi Zingales, a professor from the famously free-market University of Chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.</p><p>\u201cMy conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at this past week\u2019s tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So Prime Day rolled round, and chances are you bought a Kindle or an electric toothbrush or whatever because, well: cheap!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I say \u201cchances are\u201d because Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexa-how-was-prime-day-prime-day-2019-surpassed-black-friday\">sold over 175 million products globally</url> during the two-day event this year \u2014 more than 2018\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more impressive: that Amazon       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/business/amazon-prime-day.html\">created a huge shopping holiday</url> in five years, or that it keeps up with the demand.</p><p>I mean, how does it meet demand? Well, as The Washington Post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/15/amazon-workers-minnesota-prime-day-means-protest/?utm_term=.6a9b26f05a20\">reported</url>:</p><p>As a \u201crebinner\u201d at an Amazon fulfillment center outside Minneapolis, Meg Brady says she is expected to handle 600 items per hour, constantly pivoting on her feet to grab one item and place it in a nearby chute. Brady, 55, compared the job to an aerobics workout.</p><p>Ms. Brady was among a hundred or so workers, according to some media outlets, at the Shakopee, Minn., facility who went on strike during Prime Day. Amazon says it believes that about 15 of its associates participated in the event.</p><p>Fellow pickets at Shakopee held a placard, stating: \u201cWe\u2019re human, not robots.\u201d Among their complaints about workplace conditions was that they feel <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity\">overwhelmed by the rate of work required</url> to keep up with the automated systems.</p><p>\u201cClearly there\u2019s concern over the intensity of work, and whether technology has intensified the work,\u201d said Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment.</p><p>People also view robots as a threat to their jobs: In a 2017 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/\">Pew Research Center survey</url>, 58 percent of the respondents said they thought there should be limits on the number of jobs that companies could replace with machines.</p><p>In reality, jobs aren\u2019t automated. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-and-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/\">Tasks are</url>. That means that working with robots, rather than being replaced by them, is likely to become the norm for many people as companies like Amazon automate to increase productivity and profits.</p><p>That the trend is already troubling Amazon employees is a problem for the company, though.</p><p>\u201cThe biggest barrier to getting technology rolled out is the organizational resistance to adoption,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cSo companies need a strategy not only for how to get it to work, but also how to get the work force behind getting it rolled out.\u201d</p><p>That provides another way to think about Amazon\u2019s recent commitment to spend <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/technology/amazon-workers-retraining-automation.html\">$700 million on a retaining program</url> for a third of its work force in the United States. That\u2019s a push to make its work force fit for a technologized future, and one no doubt encouraged by the tight labor market.</p><p>But it can also be viewed as a way to coax workers into supporting the deployment of more technology. Robots increase productivity and hence profits, and retraining gives employees a clearer view to taking a larger slice of the growing pie.</p><p>Whether that will appease the workers in Shakopee remains to be seen.</p><p>Antitrust, in the House</p><p>Big Tech got an earful about its market power in Washington during the week, but that got us little closer to changing things.</p><p>Lawmakers from the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html\">grilled Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google</url> on Tuesday. Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, didn\u2019t mess around, pointing out that Facebook controls four of the world\u2019s six largest social networks (itself, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp).</p><p>\u201cWe have a word for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is called monopoly.\u201d</p><p>Criticism ran the gamut \u2014 from dual roles as seller and platform (hello, Apple and Amazon) to search dominance (howdy, Google) \u2014 and came from both parties. Still, not every lawmaker was on the offense: Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said that \u201cjust because a business is big doesn\u2019t mean that it is bad.\u201d</p><p>What to make of it? \u201cThere\u2019s clearly political interest in this whole area,\u201d said Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University.</p><p>But, Mr. First added, \u201csubstantive things don\u2019t usually come out of these hearings,\u201d and that seemed particularly the case here, where there was so little agreement on the best route forward.</p><p>Mr. First invoked a lyric from Buffalo Springfield\u2019s 1966 song \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth\u201d to describe the situation: \u201cThere\u2019s something happening here. What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear.\u201d</p><p>Can Libra survive?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472284702208000\">President Trump</url>.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/07/15/us/politics/ap-us-facebook-digital-currency.html?module=inline\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</url>.

And joining them this past week were lawmakers, as David Marcus, who leads Facebook crypto initiative, sat through more than six hours of hearings before the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/facebook-libra-congress.html?module=inline\">Senate Banking</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/technology/facebook-libra-house-hearing.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">House Financial Services Committees</url>.</p><p>Concerns were numerous. \u201cFacebook\u2019s plans raise serious privacy, trading and monetary policy concerns,\u201d said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the House committee\u2019s Democratic chairwoman. She added that Libra could \u201cyield immense economic power that could destabilize government.\u201d</p><p>But the common thread was a deep-seated mistrust of Facebook. Or, as Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, put it:</p><p>\u201cLike a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience. We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people\u2019s bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don\u2019t understand, like monetary policy.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Everyone loves a challenge, but this seems overwhelming.</p><p>Mr. Marcus said during the hearings that Facebook was \u201cowning\u201d its mistakes and \u201cworking to remedy them.\u201d And he insisted that the company wouldn\u2019t launch Libra until regulators\u2019 concerns were addressed.</p><p>But what will that take? With so many critics, there\u2019s a risk that Libra may require a fundamental redesign, said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether they will want to move ahead with something like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Some stories you shouldn\u2019t miss</p><p>\u25a0 Peter Thiel called Google\u2019s China work \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/peter-thiel-says-fbi-cia-should-probe-google-9846a042-e689-49bc-bdc7-595988ce5d8c.html\">seemingly treasonous</url>.\u201d Google denied it; Mr. Trump said his administration would \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151095675213553664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1151095675213553664&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2019-07-16%2Ftrump-says-he-will-look-at-thiel-s-treason-accusations-on-google-jy5s71qx\">take a look</url>.\u201d</p><p>\u25a0 We got a peek at Elon Musk\u2019s plan to wire up your brain.

I cover artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other \u201cemerging technologies\u201d for The New York Times. Today I\u2019m here to give you the lowdown on the week\u2019s tech news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was another black eye for the giants of the industry. On Wednesday, Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">agreed to pay a record $170 million fine</url>. Regulators said YouTube, the company\u2019s enormously popular video site, had illegally collected personal information from children without the consent of their parents and used it to make millions of dollars from targeted ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Natasha Singer and Kate Conger <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported</url> in The Times that Google would pay $136 million to the Federal Trade Commission and $34 million to New York after a joint investigation found that YouTube had violated the federal Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, known as COPPA. </p><p>That $136 million is the largest civil penalty laid down by the F.T.C. in a children\u2019s privacy case \u2014 the previous record was $5.7 million \u2014 but critics said it was a pittance for a tech giant like Google. </p><p>The settlement is another indication that the Trump administration is willing to take action against Big Tech. In July, Facebook agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a privacy case with the trade commission. But on Vox, Peter Kafka <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">wrote</url> that both the Google and Facebook settlements showed that the government wasn\u2019t ready to regulate the internet, arguing that there was no guarantee the companies would obey the law in the future.</p><p>\u201cIn both cases, the government is relying on the five-person F.T.C. to rein in the most powerful forces on the internet by asking them to interpret and enforce laws that are, in internet terms, prehistoric,\u201d Mr. Kafka wrote.</p><p>The settlement requires YouTube to ask people who upload videos whether they are sharing content for children and to change its data-gathering and ad-targeting behavior accordingly. But Mr. Kafka \u2014 and an F.T.C. commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who voted against the settlement \u2014 believes the company should be required to proactively identify content that children will view. </p><p>\u201cA cynical observer might wonder whether in the wake of this order YouTube will be even more inclined to turn a blind eye to inaccurate designations of child-directed content in order to maximize its profit,\u201d Ms. Slaughter wrote in her dissent. </p><p>British court allows live facial recognition</p><p>Don\u2019t misbehave in Britain anytime soon \u2014 at least not in public. Adam Satariano <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported</url> that a British court had ruled that governments could use live facial recognition technology without violating human rights. In other words, the police are free to use cameras in public spaces to identify people in real time.</p><p>Facial recognition technology is improving rapidly, and many legal and ethical questions loom as police departments and other government organizations increase their use of it in countries across the globe, from Britain to the United States to China.</p><p>Brought by a resident of South Wales, where the police have deployed live facial recognition, the High Court case is one of the first of its kind. The South Wales police and crime commissioner hailed the court\u2019s decision. Ed Bridges, the man who brought the suit, vowed to appeal.</p><p>\u201cThis sinister technology undermines our privacy, and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance,\u201d Mr. Bridges said.</p><p>In China, according to reporting by my colleague Paul Mozur, the government is using the technology to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">track ethnic minorities</url>. Other issues abound. Public advocates \u2014 and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">many experts in artificial intelligence</url> \u2014 are concerned that facial recognition technology can be biased against women and minorities. </p><p>Big Tech talks election security with F.B.I.</p><p>Election Day is still 14 months away. And Big Tech is already planning security. Bloomberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline\">reported</url> that Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft met with government officials in Silicon Valley on Wednesday with an eye to reducing online disinformation and foreign interference in the run-up to the next American presidential election.</p><p>Security officers from the companies gathered at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., with representatives of the F.B.I., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security. They want to facilitate coordination between industry and government in ways that didn\u2019t happen during the 2016 election. That could involve building threat models and, ultimately, sharing information about the real threats.</p><p>Yes, it\u2019s early.

After my Mum leaned down and gave me one final bear hug, I was off to start my education. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't remember this seminal moment, but I happened to stumble upon the footage this week by complete happenstance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The video is of a TV screen playing an old VHS tape and appears to be taken on a camera phone. My guess is my younger sister found the tape and filmed the video to send to me.</p><p>But maybe I should just ask Facebook, because that's where I found it - in the huge file containing my extensive Facebookhistory the company keeps on me.</p><p>Since the moment I, and everyone else signed up, the social media service has been collecting and keeping everything - I seriously mean everything - we have ever done on the site. All the conversations, videos, pictures and documents we have shared or have had sent to us are all held on a server somewhere with space specially dedicated to each of us.</p><p>I downloaded the cache (it's very easy to do) to check out everything Mark Zuckerberg had on file about me from over the years.</p><p>It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must've sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screen shots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform.</p><p>It's one thing to know Facebookholds all this data (and much more) on you but it's another thing to trawl through it and find things even you'd forgotten about yourself.</p><p>It's an odd feeling to think that, in some ways, Facebookknows you better than you know yourself.</p><p>Looking through the 500MB zip file you can see your \"Ads History\" which stores what ads you've ever clicked on as well as all the advertisers who Facebookhas shared your contact information with.</p><p>It has facial recognition data (Facebookhas 105 examples of what I look like), exhaustive photo metadata including your location and the time the photo was taken and data about every time you logged onto the site such as the IP address, location, browser and device used. </p><p>My file also contained the names and numbers for everyone in my iPhone's contact list - and yours will too.</p><p>Facebooknot only knows everything you've ever done on its platform but via cookies it leaves in your web browser it also tracks you wherever you go on the internet \"\" even if you don't use Facebook.</p><p>I, like many others, opened my Facebookaccount just over a decade ago. Arguably it's the first time in history that 10 years of human behaviour has been meticulously gathered, stored and analysed by a company on this scale.</p><p>It's called surveillance capitalism and it's the reason why Mark Zuckerberg is worth $92 billion.</p><p>But as the public and regulators become increasingly aware of just how deep Facebook's tentacles extend into our digital lives, the company is facing increasing political headwinds.</p><p>Earlier this month Belgium ordered Facebookto stop tracking internet users who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of 250,000 euros a day. </p><p>Now Australia has become the latest government to turn up the heat on the Zuckerbergs of the world.</p><p>The Federal Government has ordered the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the big tech giants in what ACCC chairman Rodd Sims said will be the broadest inquiry of its type in the world.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry will involve asking consumers how much they think the digital platforms know about them and comparing that to what is in fact being gathered.</p><p>\"My suspicion is Facebookand Google have much more personal information about people than people realise,\" Mr Sims said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNCST-6R120GJV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNCST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1W-TF81-F149-S4SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408677</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 APN Newspapers Pty.

The private sector has always held temptations for civil servants and advisers, who head to consultancies and intelligence firms to enjoy higher salaries and more freedom away from the strictures of government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But nowadays there's an even bigger prize - Silicon Valley. A succession of top Westminster policy figures have been drawn into the California tech scene, taking on roles at Google, Facebook, Uber and Netflix, and helping those companies navigate the growing regulatory scrutiny they face both in the US and abroad.</p><p>This challenge has lured Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, to Facebook and Rachel Whetstone, a former Conservative adviser, to Google, Facebook, Uber and finally to Netflix. Others have joined Twitter and Amazon following careers in Westminster and Brussels.</p><p>Former prime minister David Cameron is the chairman of Washington DC artificial intelligence company Afiniti's advisory board, and his one-time chancellor George Osborne has joined his brother's Silicon Valley venture capital firm. At lower levels, Silicon Valley companies' policy arms are stuffed with dozens of former Labour and Tory advisers and civil servants.</p><p>\"We are asked for comms people from the US and policy people from Europe,\" says Dan Hyde, founder of executive search firm Erevena, which has placed multiple British policy experts in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Incoming policy experts fill a gap left by their existing communications and policy advisers, who are experts in corporate dealings but have less experience managing regulators.</p><p>US tech companies are \"starting to come up against the regulatory aspects of policy,\" Hyde says. Much to Silicon Valley's chagrin, it has indeed become an inevitability. Washington, which has for many years been content to turn a blind eye to tech's West Coast money-printing machine, has suddenly begun to take notice.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, his Twitter counterpart, have both been hauled in front of senators in the past 18 months.</p><p>Silicon Valley's biggest companies are under pressure as they are accused of anti-competitive behaviour, damaging the democratic process and mismanaging the data of millions of users.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google face competition investigations from the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, and attacks on the tech giants have become a regular rallying cry from the crop of would-be Democratic presidential candidates, such as Elizabeth Warren. Silicon Valley needs help negotiating these treacherous new waters, and it has turned to Westminster to get it.</p><p>But why Britons? British entrepreneurs are already common in the California tech scene, tempted away from London by the promise of bigger investments and proximity to billion-dollar companies.</p><p>There's also the fact that much of the pressure is coming from Europe.</p><p>The UK takes a more even-handed middle ground than the more draconian approach taken by no-nonsense EU regulators.</p><p>Andrew Whittaker, the UK's consul general in San Francisco, argues that British policy experts have experience balancing business-friendly policy with managing public pressure.</p><p>\"From a government perspective, we're trying to get the balance right between being both innovation friendly, supporting businesses, and addressing legitimate concerns that our citizens raise, and people are used to doing that,\" he says.</p><p>Europe looks set to keep up the pressure it has been putting on Silicon Valley for half a decade. Margrethe Vestager, long a thorn in the side of US tech companies as competition commissioner, is expanding her power base to become a vice president of the European Commission.</p><p>Experience of Westminster's more open culture, where advisers mingle with journalists in the pub and brief them via text message, is also an asset for these new hires, who are joining some of the most secretive and controlling companies in the world.</p><p>Many of them hope to encourage their bosses to loosen up so they can try to improve the sector's poor reputation for transparency.</p><p>Nick Pickles, director of public policy strategy at Twitter, was previously director of Big Brother Watch in London, and before that ran as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in the north of England.</p><p>\"You can hear echoes of previous debates in Europe and the UK in discussions around the world,\" he said. \"Whether it's discussions about content regulation or privacy and surveillance, those have been on the table in Westminster or Brussels for some time and there are lessons from those debates that are relevant in the US and elsewhere.\"</p><p>For the emigrants, coastal California, with its redwood forests, big-wave surfing and dry, warm climate, is decent compensation.</p><p>A sizeable Silicon Valley salary, plus stock options, is likely to be a considerable step up even for someone coming from the most successful of Westminster careers.</p><p>Earlier this year it emerged that the Cleggs have bought a \u00a37m home, with a hot tub and pool, in Atherton, San Mateo, crowned the most expensive postcode in the US by Forbes.</p><p>For Clegg, an arch-Remainer, being far, far away from the UK as Brexit rumbles on probably doesn't hurt either.</p><p>'We are asked for comms people from the US and policy people from Europe'</p><p>Experience of London politics' more open culture, where advisers mingle with journalists in the pub, is also an asset for these new hires, who are joining some of the most secretive companies in the world</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CAPTAIN Z FOR THE TELEGRAPH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-153904961</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X92-4DR1-DYTY-C3F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Next, the world.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW YORK - On a cold February morning at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the skeleton of a modern 15-storey building was rising from a muddy construction site along the East River. As long and as tall as a cruise ship, the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty, century-old dry docks, serving notice to the industrial neighbourhood that the new economy was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, known as Dock 72, is the brainchild of WeWork, the fast-growing New York-based business own by an Israeli that is now valued at $20 billion. In just eight years, WeWork has built a network of 212 shared working spaces around the globe. But WeWork's chief executive and co-founder, Adam Neumann, isn't content to just lease out communal offices. Neumann - a lanky, longhaired 38-year-old - wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work, live and play.</p><p>When Dock 72 is completed this year, if the aggressive timeline holds, it will represent the fullest expression of Neumann's expansive vision to date. There will be an enormous co-working space, a luxury spa and large offices, for other companies like IBM and Verizon, that are designed and run by WeWork. There will be a juice bar, a real bar, a gym with a boxing studio, an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan. There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershop.</p><p>It will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep - and if Neumann has his way, you'll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby.</p><p>It's an all-encompassing sort of ambition, and Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman. Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office, he argues, WeWork can heal our fractured society.</p><p>\"How do you change the world?\" Neumann asked in a recent interview. \"Bring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment.\"</p><p>It may sound simplistic, but around the globe, companies are buying whatever it is that Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, are selling. WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries - it offers work spaces in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver - assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.</p><p>WeWork last year bought the iconic Lord &amp; Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is being transformed into the company's new headquarters. That purchase from Canada's Hudson's Bay Co. was made possible in part by a recent $4.4 billion investment from Softbank, the Japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire Masayoshi Son.</p><p>Already the company has started WeLive, its residential offering, and Rise, its gym. It acquired Meetup, a social network that facilitates in-person gatherings, and the Flatiron School, a coding academy. Still to come: WeGrow, the company's for-profit elementary school, set to open in September. WeWork has even invested in plans to create giant wave pools for inland surfing.</p><p>A company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.</p><p>Is it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? \"I've made that argument,\" said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, \"great entrepreneurs like Adam don't listen to guys like me.\"</p><p>As WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage - leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork's success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven startups that could quickly fold.</p><p>IWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at $2 billion. Yet Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.</p><p>\"Adam's explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,\" said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. \"This is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there's an energy behind the brand, and he's gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.\"</p><p>To assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Neumann. WeWork isn't really a real estate company. It's a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live but the very world we live in.</p><p>It's an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. So far, it seems to be working.</p><p>Son, WeWork's largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.</p><p>\"Make it 10 times bigger than your original plan,\" Son told Forbes late last year. \"If you think in that manner, the valuation is cheap. It can be worth a few hundred billion dollars.\"</p><p>Close Communities</p><p>The notion that white-collar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one. From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.</p><p>\"The only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,\" said Nikil Saval, author of \"Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\" \"So the office was made to resemble an assembly line.\"</p><p>This dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.</p><p>Raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees - especially millennials - expect enlightened, unconventional offices.</p><p>Enter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.</p><p>Soon he and a friend - McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect - founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.</p><p>\"Me and Miguel have this common ground,\" Neumann said. \"We both grew up in very close communities.\"</p><p>(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)</p><p>WeWork didn't invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Neumann and McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of startups: an industrial chic esthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.</p><p>Individuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Startups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.</p><p>It's a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care startups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in Tribeca, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.</p><p>But for WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and startups.</p><p>The Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.</p><p>But Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.</p><p>\"As a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,\" she said. \"Some of the techie and startup types housed at WeWork aren't facing customers all day so don't always have the same standards.\"</p><p>Gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork's business with corporate clients, especially if Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.</p><p>\"We have economies of scale,\" he said. \"I'll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 per cent.\"</p><p>It might seem like another instance of Neumann's talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies - GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them - are signing on.</p><p>For years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It's not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.</p><p>\"We only have 200,000 members,\" McKelvey, 43, said. \"That's ridiculous. We need to have 2 million and then 20 million.\"</p><p>More 'We' Than 'Me'</p><p>Bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattan's financial district. But at 110 Wall St., a building controlled entirely by WeWork, the party was just getting started.</p><p>Last year, this 1960s-era office tower was converted into a mixed-use development of Neumann's design. There is a co-working space. On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville, Fuku, Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar, the Mail Room.</p><p>And then there is a WeLive: a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a short-term basis. Tenants get the signature WeWork esthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron, as well as various perks. There are hot tubs on the terrace. There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room. There are a chef's kitchen and a communal dining room. At a bar on a residential floor, a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowing.</p><p>In the communal dining area, three brothers - Jordan, Jake and Jimmy DeCicco - were cooking for a half-dozen social media influencers, hoping to stir up enthusiasm for their protein-infused iced coffee company. Over rib-eye steaks and Brussels sprouts, they talked about promoting the brand and breaking into new markets, passing out beers to anyone who walked by.</p><p>The brothers are all in: They live in WeLive, work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWork's nearby gym, Rise.</p><p>\"It's awesome,\" Jake DeCicco said. \"You just roll out of bed, go down the elevator and get to work.\"</p><p>Had Neumann been there to share a beer, those words would have been music to his ears. He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a world-changing innovation. Each WeWork has a \"community manager\" who keeps tabs on members, makes introductions and organizes social activities.</p><p>If more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water, the thinking goes, they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another's socially responsible startups, and then the world will be a better place.</p><p>Once you choose to enter a WeWork, you choose to be part of something more 'we' than 'me,'\" Neumann said. \"People start coming together. They'll see each other in the elevator, they talk in the stairways. There's a thousand other things they do.\"</p><p>Elevators. Stairways. Hardly world-changing innovations. But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization. Like beer kegs that never run dry.</p><p>More than most companies, WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue. Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink. There are wine tastings at WeLive. Company parties feature top-shelf liquor. Neumann has a well-known penchant for tequila, and a well-stocked bar is prominent in his office.</p><p>On a recent Tuesday at 4:07 p.m., the community manager of a WeWork in midtown Manhattan sent an email reading: \"It's time to get your creative juices flowing! Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine &amp; paint a beautiful picture.\" Just after noon on Valentine's Day, there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area.</p><p>Although alcohol is a social lubricant for some, it can be off-putting to many others. Many women have shared stories of feeling uncomfortable with what they described as a frat house culture at some WeWorks, prompting some to leave.</p><p>As WeWork has grown, minor scandals have rattled it. In 2015, the company grew ensnared in a complicated legal dispute with a group of former janitors who tried to unionize at a subcontractor that WeWork used. The next year, WeWork drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to a related policy.</p><p>But so far nothing - not alcohol, labour disputes, questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity - has managed to alter the company's trajectory.</p><p>\"We're a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a day-to-day basis,\" said Dunlevie of Benchmark. \"And we're in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon.\"</p><p>Teaching Tykes</p><p>In September, WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date: a kindergarten. It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sun.</p><p>The creation of Neumann's wife, Rebekah, 39, the school is known as WeGrow. It promises a well-designed space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3-year-olds on up.</p><p>WeGrow fits neatly into Adam Neumann's expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs. But the risk-reward calculus is different when starting a school.</p><p>WeGrow won't scale as rapidly as WeWork has, so the financial upside is limited. Yet should something go wrong, the fallout could be devastating: It's one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer. It's another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone's child.</p><p>Although Rebekah Neumann has no background in education (on the website, she describes herself as \"an avid student of life\" and says her \"superpower\" is \"intuition\"), she has applied for accreditation from the state, has hired a team of career educators and is accepting applications for the coming school year. Tuition for toddlers: $36,000 a year.</p><p>\"We all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in,\" Adam Neumann said. \"But we decided we're going to go into education. If you really want to change the world, change kids when they're 2.\"</p><p>As he proselytized, Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office, which is bigger than many New York City apartments. It included a conference table, a video conferencing setup, several desks, a bar, spreads of food, a Peloton exercise bike, a climbing machine, a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling, a gong, an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroom.</p><p>\"It's going to work,\" Neumann said. \"Is it going to be perfect? Definitely not. Are we going to make mistakes? A hundred per cent. Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes? Definitely. It's what we do here.\"</p><p>Although Neumann's unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some, it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant. Walter Isaacson, the biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, counts Neumann as a friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed.</p><p>\"He has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations,\" Isaacson said. \"And like Steve Jobs and other great entrepreneurs, he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology.\"</p><p>'Make a Life'</p><p>It can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued startup that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na\u00efve investors. With little more than faddish interior design, free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers, Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for white-collar workers - and for education - and vows that it can change the world.</p><p>It's the kind of utopian outlook that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing. But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Neumann, he doesn't show it.</p><p>On a Wednesday night in January, Neumann strode onstage before a packed house at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, basked in spotlights. Wearing a black leather biker jacket and a T-shirt that read \"High on We,\" Neumann was playing host at his own extravagant party, a multiday celebration of WeWork and its extended community.</p><p>On this, the first night of festivities, Neumann would oversee a \"Shark Tank\"-like competition for socially responsible small businesses - ranging from a startup that made customized prosthetics to a food-delivery service staffed by refugees - each vying for a $1 million prize.</p><p>Earlier, Neumann had rattled off the company's achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions. As the evening's performer, the Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore, waited backstage, Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should \"make a life, not just a living,\" the company's aspirational motto.</p><p>Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs. \"Of course that makes a lot of sense, but who's going to pay for that?\" he said. \"And we said, 'Well, Masa might!'\"</p><p>The line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room - Son, whose nickname is Masa, was conveniently absent - but it was a tell from Neumann, a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house money.</p><p>Then, when the time came to choose a winner, Neumann made a surprise announcement: Instead of choosing one recipient, WeWork would give away $1 million each to two of the companies - re: 3D, a 3-D printing company, and Global Vision 2020, a nonprofit that provides prescription glasses to people in the developing world. And it would give another couple of million to the other half-dozen finalists.</p><p>Confetti fell from the rafters. The winners cried on stage. Neumann took it all in, beaming.</p><p>Even Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around. \"I was just watching it, chugging a Red Bull,\" he said shortly into his set, \"and I immediately thought, 'Damn, I should have got into technology.'\"</p><p>New York Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2018022045083902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPF-FSP1-F105-64D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

As long and as tall as a cruise ship, the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty, century-old dry docks, serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming.</p><p>The project, known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dock72.com/\">Dock 72</url>, is the brainchild of WeWork, the fast-growing New York start-up valued at a whopping $20 billion. In just eight years, WeWork has built a network of 212 shared working spaces around the globe. But WeWork\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Adam Neumann, isn\u2019t content to just lease out communal offices. Mr. Neumann \u2014 a lanky, longhaired 38-year-old Israeli \u2014 wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work, live and play.</p><p>When Dock 72 is completed this year, if the aggressive timeline holds, it will represent the fullest expression of Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision to date. There will be an enormous co-working space, a luxury spa and large offices, for other companies like IBM and Verizon, that are designed and run by WeWork. There will be a juice bar, a real bar, a gym with a boxing studio, an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan. There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershop.</p><p>It will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep \u2014 and if Mr. Neumann has his way, you\u2019ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby.</p><p>It\u2019s an all-encompassing sort of ambition, and Mr. Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman. Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office, he argues, WeWork can heal our fractured society.</p><p>\u201cHow do you change the world?\u201d Mr. Neumann asked in a recent interview. \u201cBring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment.\u201d</p><p>It may sound simplistic, but around the globe, companies are buying whatever it is that Mr. Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, are selling. WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries, assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.</p><p>WeWork<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/lord-taylor-wework.html\">last year bought</url> the iconic Lord &amp; Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is being transformed into the company\u2019s new headquarters. That deal was made possible in part by a recent $4.4 billion       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/business/dealbook/softbank-and-fund-to-invest-4-4-billion-in-wework.html\">investment from</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/business/dealbook/softbank-and-fund-to-invest-4-4-billion-in-wework.html\">SoftBank</url>, the Japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire Masayoshi Son.</p><p>Already the company has started WeLive, its residential offering, and Rise, its gym. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/business/dealbook/wework-meetup.html\">acquired Meetup</url>, the social network that facilitates in-person gatherings, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/in-a-bet-against-college-wework-acquires-a-coding-bootcamp-1513306375-270d7908-c118-418f-9d14-21aef5ddebfb.html\">the Flatiron School</url>, a coding academy. Still to come: WeGrow, the company\u2019s       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/nyregion/private-schools-startups-wework-wegrow-new-york.html\">for-profit elementary school</url>, set to open in September. WeWork has even invested in plans to create giant wave pools for inland surfing.</p><p>A company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.</p><p>Is it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? \u201cI\u2019ve made that argument,\u201d said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, \u201cgreat entrepreneurs like Adam don\u2019t listen to guys like me.\u201d</p><p>As WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage \u2014 leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it out to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork\u2019s success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven start-ups that could quickly fold.</p><p>IWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at just $2 billion. Yet Mr. Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,\u201d said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. \u201cThis is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there\u2019s an energy behind the brand, and he\u2019s gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Mr. Neumann. WeWork isn\u2019t really a real estate company. It\u2019s a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Mr. Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in.</p><p>It\u2019s an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. And so far, it seems to be working.</p><p>Mr. Son, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.</p><p>\u201cMake it 10 times bigger than your original plan,\u201d Mr. Son <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2017/10/02/the-way-we-work/#60ff91491b18\">told Forbes</url> late last year. \u201cIf you think in that manner, the valuation is cheap. It can be worth a few hundred billion dollars.\u201d</p><p>Close Communities</p><p>The notion that white-collar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one. From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.</p><p>\u201cThe only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,\u201d said Nikil Saval, author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201d \u201cSo the office was made to resemble an assembly line.\u201d</p><p>This dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.</p><p>Raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees \u2014 especially millennials \u2014 expect enlightened, unconventional offices.</p><p>Enter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real, and ready to be monetized. Mr. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.</p><p>Soon he and a friend \u2014 Mr. McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect \u2014 founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.</p><p>\u201cMe and Miguel have this common ground,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWe both grew up in very close communities.\u201d</p><p>WeWork didn\u2019t invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Mr. Neumann and Mr. McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of start-ups: an industrial chic aesthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.</p><p>Individuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Start-ups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.</p><p>It\u2019s a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care start-ups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in TriBeCa, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.</p><p>For WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and start-ups.</p><p>The Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.</p><p>But Ms. Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.</p><p>\u201cAs a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the techie and start-up types housed at WeWork aren\u2019t facing customers all day, so don\u2019t always have the same standards.\u201d</p><p>Gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork\u2019s business with corporate clients, especially if Mr. Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Mr. Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.</p><p>\u201cWe have economies of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percent.\u201d</p><p>It might seem like another instance of Mr. Neumann\u2019s talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies \u2014 GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them \u2014 are signing on.</p><p>For years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.</p><p>\u201cWe only have 200,000 members,\u201d Mr. McKelvey, 43, said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. We need to have two million and then 20 million.\u201d</p><p>More \u2018We\u2019 Than \u2018Me\u2019</p><p>Bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. But at 110 Wall Street, a building controlled entirely by WeWork, the party was just getting started.</p><p>Last year, this 1960s-era office tower was converted into a mixed-use development of Mr. Neumann\u2019s design. There is a co-working space. On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville, Fuku, Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar called the Mail Room.</p><p>And then there is a WeLive: a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a short-term basis. Tenants get the signature WeWork aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron, as well as various perks. There are hot tubs on the terrace. There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room. There are a chef\u2019s kitchen and a communal dining room. At a bar on a residential floor, a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowing.</p><p>In the communal dining area, three brothers \u2014 Jordan, Jake and Jimmy DeCicco \u2014 were cooking for a half-dozen social media influencers, hoping to stir up enthusiasm for their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.drinksupercoffee.com/\">protein-infused iced coffee</url> company. Over rib-eye steaks and brussels sprouts, they talked about promoting the brand and breaking into new markets, passing out beers to anyone who walked by.</p><p>The brothers are all in: They live in WeLive, work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWork\u2019s nearby gym, Rise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Jake DeCicco said. \u201cYou just roll out of bed, go down the elevator and get to work.\u201d</p><p>Had Mr. Neumann been there to share a beer, those words would have been music to his ears. He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a world-changing innovation. Each WeWork has a \u201ccommunity manager\u201d who keeps tabs on members, makes introductions and organizes social activities.</p><p>If more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water, the thinking goes, they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another\u2019s socially responsible start-ups, and then the world will be a better place.</p><p>\u201cOnce you choose to enter a WeWork, you choose to be part of something more \u2018we\u2019 than \u2018me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cPeople start coming together. They\u2019ll see each other in the elevator, they talk in the stairways. There\u2019s a thousand other things they do.\u201d</p><p>Elevators. Stairways. Hardly world-changing innovations. But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization. Like beer kegs that never run dry.</p><p>More than most companies, WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue. Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink. There are wine tastings at WeLive. Company parties feature top-shelf liquor. Mr. Neumann has a well-known penchant for tequila, and a well-stocked bar is prominent in his office.</p><p>On a recent Tuesday at 4:07 p.m., the community manager of a WeWork in Midtown Manhattan sent an email reading: \u201cIt\u2019s time to get your creative juices flowing! Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine &amp; paint a beautiful picture.\u201d Just after noon on Valentine\u2019s Day, there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area.</p><p>Though alcohol is a social lubricant for some, it can be off-putting to many others. Many women have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/what-the-sharing-economy-really-delivers-entitlement.html\">shared stories of feeling uncomfortable</url> with what they described as a frat house culture at some WeWorks, prompting some to leave. </p><p>As WeWork has grown, minor scandals have rattled the company. In 2015, the company grew ensnared in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/business/at-wework-an-idealistic-startup-clashes-with-its-cleaners.html\">a complicated legal dispute</url> with a group of former janitors who tried to unionize at a subcontractor that WeWork used. The next year, WeWork drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes, and for its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/business/dealbook/start-ups-embrace-arbitration-to-settle-workplace-disputes.html\">firing of an employee</url> who refused to adhere to a related policy.</p><p>But so far nothing \u2014 not alcohol, labor disputes, questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity \u2014 has managed to alter the company\u2019s trajectory.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Mr. Dunlevie of Benchmark. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon.\u201d</p><p> Teaching Tykes</p><p>In September, WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date: a kindergarten. It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sun.</p><p>The creation of Mr. Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, 39, the school is known as WeGrow. When it opens, it promises a well-designed space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3-year-olds on up.</p><p>WeGrow fits neatly into Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs. But the risk-reward calculus is different when starting a school.</p><p>WeGrow won\u2019t scale as rapidly as WeWork has, so the financial upside is limited. Yet should something go wrong, the fallout could be devastating: It\u2019s one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer. It\u2019s another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone\u2019s child.</p><p>Though Ms. Neumann has no background in education (on the website, she <url normalizedValue=\"http://wegrow.com/#team\">describes herself</url> as \u201can avid student of life\u201d and says her \u201csuperpower\u201d is \u201cintuition\u201d), she has applied for accreditation from the state, has hired a team of career educators and is accepting applications for the coming school year. Tuition for toddlers: $36,000 a year.</p><p>\u201cWe all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBut we decided we\u2019re going to go into education. If you really want to change the world, change kids when they\u2019re 2.\u201d</p><p>As he proselytized, Mr. Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office, which is bigger than many New York City apartments. It included a conference table, a video conferencing setup, several desks, a bar, spreads of food, a Peloton exercise bike, a climbing machine, a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling, a gong, an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to work,\u201d Mr. Neumann continued. \u201cIs it going to be perfect? Definitely not. Are we going to make mistakes? A hundred percent. Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes? Definitely. It\u2019s what we do here.\u201d</p><p>Though such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some, it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant. Walter Isaacson, the biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, counts Mr. Neumann as a friend, and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed.</p><p>\u201cHe has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cAnd like Steve Jobs and other great entrepreneurs, he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u2018Make a Life\u2019</p><p>It can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued start-up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na\u00efve investors. With little more than faddish interior design, free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers, Mr. Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for white-collar workers \u2014 and for education \u2014 and vows that it can change the world.</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing. But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Mr. Neumann, he doesn\u2019t show it.</p><p>On a Wednesday night in January, Mr. Neumann strode onstage before a packed house at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, basked in spotlights. Wearing a black leather biker jacket and a T-shirt that read \u201cHigh on We,\u201d Mr. Neumann was playing host at his own extravagant party, a multiday celebration of WeWork and its extended community.<br/></p><p>On this, the first night of festivities, Mr. Neumann would oversee a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-like competition for socially responsible small businesses \u2014 ranging from a start-up that made customized prosthetics to a food-delivery service staffed by refugees \u2014 each vying for a $1 million prize.</p><p>Earlier, Mr. Neumann had rattled off the company\u2019s achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions. As the evening\u2019s performer, the Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore, waited backstage, Mr. Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should \u201cmake a life, not just a living,\u201d the company\u2019s aspirational motto.</p><p>Mr. Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs. \u201cOf course that makes a lot of sense, but who\u2019s going to pay for that?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018Well, Masa might!\u2019\u201d</p><p>The line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room \u2014 Mr. Son, whose nickname is Masa, was conveniently absent \u2014 but it was a tell from Mr. Neumann, a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house money.</p><p>Then, when the time came to choose a winner, Mr. Neumann made a surprise announcement: Instead of choosing one recipient, WeWork would give away $1 million each to two of the companies \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://re3d.org/\">Re:3D</url>, a 3-D printing company, and Global Vision 2020, a nonprofit that provides prescription glasses to people in the developing world. And it would give another couple of million to the other half-dozen finalists.</p><p>Confetti fell from the rafters. The winners cried on stage. Mr. Neumann took it all in, beaming.</p><p>Even Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around. \u201cI was just watching it, chugging a Red Bull,\u201d he said shortly into his set, \u201cand I immediately thought, \u2018Damn, I should have got into technology.\u2019\u201d</p><p>David Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

The White House announcing its first trade deal today, unveiling its successfully renegotiated a 6-year-old South Korea- U.S. deal, giving President Trump his first major trade deal since being elected.</p><p>And the administration saying its maximum pressure campaign is working.

Six million jobs at least, gone. We have a trade deficit of $504 billion. It's really $375 billion.</p><p>Many different ways of looking at it, anyway you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. With China we're going to be doing a section 301 trade action. It could be about $60 billion. I'll be signing it right here, right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: The Dow closing the day down just slightly 9 point to 23,848. The NASDAQ also ending lower for a second day as Amazon and Netflix's shares drop. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, President Trump stepping up for American workers and businesses in his first major trade deal since being elected. The U.S. and South Korea reaching what officials are hailing as a quote, \"innovative trade deal,\" touted as a roadmap for future negotiations.</p><p>In return for exemption from Trump's 25 percent tariff on steel imports, South Korea is agreeing to limit its U.S. steel export to roughly 70 percent of its average expert from 2015 to 2017, allow twice as many U.S. made cars 50,000 for manufacturer enter Korea without meeting local safety standards, and extend for 20 years a 25 percent tariff on South Korean pickup trucks exported to the U.S.</p><p>The Trump administration also saying its wrapping up a side deal to deter South Korea currency devaluations.</p><p>Joining me now is former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush, Brad Blakeman. Brad, welcome to the show. The trade deal to me, it's the first unilateral trade deal that we've done, we've dropped down the TPP, we're looking at negotiating -- renegotiating NAFTA.</p><p>A little bit of window dressing. A 25 percent tariff for the next 20 years on South Korea pick-ups coming in. There aren't any South Korea imports coming in, so a little bit of window dressing. And as far as cars going there only 10,000 go there anyway, so but the main part about this was the quota. Reducing that by 30 percent of the level from 2015 to 2017. Is this a good deal?</p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT: It's a great deal. It's a heck of a lot better than what we had. And the president is right to get out of this multilateral deals and deal bilaterally with countries.</p><p>Look, we have, we are sending $23 billion a year to South Korea, and they're sending back about 2.5 billion, that's not fair trade at all and can't be considered free trade when they have restrictions that are not reciprocal on our end. So it's going to take us a while to ramp up the amount of cars we sell.</p><p>But we can start selling auto parts to them tomorrow. This is a very good deal and it's just a start, and other countries should wake up because Donald Trump is going to be knocking on your door very soon.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, we only sold 10,000 cars last year between G.M. and Ford so it's not going to sell a lot of cars out of this deal, the main deal is that the trade tariff itself reducing to 30 percent below.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: How does this not just raise prices, and how would this quota, even though it is a quota not a tariff be different as far as actions that happened in steel prices rising and jobs being cost in our own country right here in the United States like the 2002 Bush tariff did on steel?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, what we've got to do is we've got to o look beyond just this steel and look at steel like we do any other product from a national global standpoint.</p><p>We are getting screwed. And the status quo is not good enough. And once we start making more deals you'll see that the deals overall will start equalizing themselves. But we have to start standing up for the American worker, and we also have to stand up to unfair trade practices by other countries, friend and foe alike.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And the fact that there is 140,000 jobs in steel producing industries and 6.5 million you're not worried about the disparity between the two that this will affect that 6.5 million much greater than we'll add jobs that 140,000?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: No, because I think that overall once we get finished with, you know, leveling the playing field, I think we'll have a great deal of good to happen, not only to our workforce but also our economy in general. I think it's about time that we start equalizing the standing that America has. We are a super power, yet we're treated like just another nation. Under Obama that was fine. Under Trump unacceptable.</p><p>LAYFIELD: The media today though, Brad, was not interested in America's first trade deal. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did the president direct John Dowd to talk to the attorneys of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn without potential pardon?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A quick question on Stormy Daniels and the lawsuit that was offered overnight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I could ask you about the president's former lawyer, John Dowd, are there any actions that Mr. Dowd took while he was serving the president that President Trump was uncomfortable?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why has he not spoken to Stormy Daniels, Sarah?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Is the media missing something here, Brad?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: It's a preoccupation. This is -- this is again just a part of the resistance that started the day he was the elected president and it continues. Look, they don't talk about full employment, they don't talk about interest rates, they don't talk about pretty much nonexistence of inflation. Look, if it wasn't for bad news, they wouldn't report any news. And this is -- the American people get it, though.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think you are right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: They really do.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And Brad, thank you very much for your time today.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: My pleasure.</p><p>LAYFIELD: As the North Korea peace talks draw closer, a reminder how unhappy the media is about former Ambassador John Bolton as appointment as our new national security adviser. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This may be the worst thing he has done. He said to them no more stupid wars, now he brings in the godfather of stupid wars, John Bolton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that the risk of a war of a shooting war with Iran, and North Korea are substantially greater than they were this morning. I think it dramatically increases the risk that a lot of Americans and Koreans, perhaps Japanese, end up dead.</p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: John Bolton, he is the hammer and everything is a nail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just throwing all the toys in the air, I'm mad, I'm getting rid of everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Despite all this, my next guest said that there is a silver ling with Bolton's pick. Global intelligence firm chief executive, R.P. Eddy, and the author of \"Finding Cassandra to Prevent Catastrophes\" alongside Richard Clarke, and I think the most -- the best intelligent expert in the world today. So, R.P. thank you for joining us.</p><p>All of this talks about Bolton, he has his hand on the trigger. He has said he is for a preemptive strike in Iran and North Korea, but you say there is a silver lining.</p><p>R.P. EDDY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE: There is a silver lining, but John, I don't you to be too optimistic about my view. So, there is a -- there is a -- you know, if you think of a spectrum of political position inside of the Washington, D,C, beltway policy world, John Bolton lives on one extreme, there's no doubt about it. But he is still within that one mainstream dialogue and I think that matters.</p><p>And the thing that matters more to me is Donald Trump unfortunately now seems to be throwing away a number of good advisers, and believe me, he can make a lot of decisions on his own, and I don't think that any president on his own can handle the massive complexity of the presidency. Although I see him sort of, steering that direction.</p><p>So a guy like John Bolton, though I don't love his policies, in fact, I really dislike some of them, he is a loud guy, he's got a point of view on a lot of things and the president will not be able to throw his opinion away, so at least the president will have a real veteran hand with him.</p><p>And this guy, he understands the State Department, he understands the DOD, he understand the international negotiations, he understand the U.N. He doesn't like most of those things but at least he knows how it works, and at least the president won't be able to ignore him, and that matters to me.</p><p>I want the president to have as much counsel around him as he can. I'm not speaking about if I love or hate Trump and I didn't since, I just want the president to have good counsel or at least some wise counsel. And though John Bolton's positions are different than mine he will give him counsel.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Bolton you say is a loud guy, I think it's fair to say our president could be classified as the same so you have two loud guys in the room. And now, North Korea is at the bargaining table, did this come about because of China stepping up, because of the U.S. And why did they come to the bargaining table.</p><p>EDDY: I will always take a pessimistic view on North Korea until I'm proved wrong until we can begin to be optimistic.</p><p>LAYFIELD: They've only lied about everything else.</p><p>EDDY: You got it. And so, look, I think the Olympics was a really smart thing, it was nice to get everyone kind of, you know, reduce the tensions that's a valuable thing we bought some time, but time actually serves the North Koreans not us, right?</p><p>So the next thing North Koreans have to do tactically is they have to prove that one of their ICBM's can deliver a payload to the United States or within that kind of radius. Once they do that, they have every card they need for negotiation.</p><p>And as long as they can delay us from doing a preventive attack which Bolton wants, which the president is entertained, which McMaster even entertained, as long as they can prevent that, and it's a great idea to throw a card out there since they want to negotiate to saw things down, they can get to the point where they can be able to show that delivery then they have more to negotiate with. So, it's kind of what I think is going on.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Would they really disarm? I mean, is this something--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EDDY: I would love if they did, but never say never.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But what happens if they don't?</p><p>EDDY: It depends on your view of this, right. So, it depends very simply. If you think North Korea can be trusted as a rational safe holder of nuclear weapons or not. And historically, everything they have said about nuclear weapons would lead you to that latter position, we really can't trust these guys, they've never said anything about being responsible actors.</p><p>Until a few months ago when they came out and said, listen, don't worry we're not maniacs, we're not going to nuke anybody. We'll be responsible nuclear actors. If they can continue that dialogue, if they can get some safe weapon handling procedures and protocols in place, as other countries did, like India, Pakistan, and Israel, then maybe we can say, look, as much as we hate the idea we've learned they're not crazy and we can allow them to have some degree of nuclear weapons.</p><p>If we can't get to that point of view we're in a really tough pickle, and then all of a sudden the John Bolton ideas, which currently seem crazy seam less crazy.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And what does the Korean peninsula look like if they do disarm, do you see a reunification? Do you see this--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EDDY: Well, if they do disarm they're not doing it because they don't want to get rid of weapons, they're doing it because they want something massive in return.</p><p>And you know, the way I kind of joke about it, if the leaders want their kids to play soccer at Stanford, right, they want to get back into the world, they want their kids to go play football. And they want to get back into the world. So it won't be a matter of, you know, business as usual, they want trade back on, or be at the oil fields that they have offshore which are massive.</p><p>They'll be back in the community of nations, they'll have their provision and they want to get going. Now the question then is, can you have a South Korea, North Korea two country so radically different, will they change their system of governance or not, will they stop with some of the chemical weapons issue, the biological weapons issue and the other stuff we care about.</p><p>But so long as they're back in the community of nations, you know, then you have a lot of questions out, again, proliferation. These are bad actors on all sorts of scales.</p><p>LAYFIELD: This isn't fair. We only have few seconds left, but Russia, are we doing enough to stop Russia actually hacking into the next election?</p><p>EDDY: No, we're not. And you know, I know it's contrary to a lot of your guests on here. This president hasn't done enough to stand up against Russia. But I was really heartened to see that he kicked these diplomats out recently. I think that was a good thing joining our NATO our very special allies in Britain. There is a lot more he needs to do against Russia in our state.</p><p>Remember, elections are managed at the state level, that means you got every knucklehead in every small state trying to tell me he can prevent a hack from Russia, he can't do it. It is a massive vulnerability and it needs to be fixed.</p><p>Simply every machine needs a paper trail, that simple. That's all you got to do. They're still hackable but if you leave your voting booth, and you got a paper certificate that says you voted as you did and you put that in different bucket, now we have a trail and we don't have to worry as much about the hacking. It's still a big problem. Twenty two states were hacked in the last election at least, and if you can see it you can change it as they say in information operations.</p><p>LAYFIELD: R.P., I'll put out on Twitter that it was great to have you on and you're like a Santa Claus. You deliver.</p><p>EDDY: John, it's always good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Great to see you as well. Thank you very much, R.P.</p><p>Let's check your money, stocks down a second day on worries about regulation of big tech names. Nicole Pettalides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the latest. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: John, they did it again. That volatility is here on Wall Street. Back and forth action throughout the day. And the Dow was pretty much 50/50 for winners and losers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 9, so down two days in a row. The S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of 1 percent.</p><p>The winners on the Dow, Merck, Wal-Mart, G.E., Travelers and Verizon. Telecom did very well today. Amazon gets beaten down, this after their report that President Trump is looking to change the tax treatment of Amazon, concerns about the mom and pop shops, while all the rest of the retailers got a pop, J.C. Penney and Sears, all of them with up arrows. Tesla is to the downside. This, as federal regulators are looking into that fatal crash. And Moody's was at debt (Ph) its downgrade for Tesla. John?</p><p>LAYFIELD: It's so much easier to report when stocks are up. Thank you, Nicole.</p><p>Coming up, a heartwarming story for Easter.

Billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg saying he would never sell your information without consent back in 2009. We have the sound.</p><p>But first, now at least 12 states are going to sue to block the Trump administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census. My next guest think it's ridiculous. RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany joins me next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's be realistic about this. Do we think this is about getting an accurate view of the census, and protecting voting rights, or is it to in fact suppress minority voting?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This administration that has consistently tried to suppress voting rights.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Civil rights groups slamming the move saying it could significantly reduce responses from immigrants fearful of deportation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Adding the question, could scare off undocumented immigrants from participating, potentially throwing off federal funding.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Critics say this is about intimidating immigrants and will result in a population under count, potentially that could lead to lost congressional seats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say to critics who argue that ultimately this is a way to target immigrants?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: The media going haywire over a census question. Now at last 12 states are going to sue to block the Trump administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census. Opponents of the move say the question will keep even legal immigrants from completing the form which would reduce the population count in Democratic areas of the country.</p><p>Joining me now is RNC spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany. Kayleigh, welcome to the show. Is this question, it's been deemed as if it's a political question. The left says you're trying to suppress immigrant voters, the right says just exactly the opposite.</p><p>Is this really something that is being used as a power grab for the vote, the administration or is this simply a question trying to find out who's in our country?</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, SPOKESPERSON, RNC: This is trying to find out who is in our country, and liberals are acting insane here. We're simply trying to find out who is here, who is a citizen, who is not. And guess why we are trying to figure that out, because this census will determine how many representatives each state gets in Congress.</p><p>You look back to 2010, the states that gain seats were Florida, Arizona, Texas, states that do have heavy illegal immigrant population. So if these individuals are registering, they appear to be citizens and they get extra representation for that, that cannot happen.</p><p>We need to have citizens representing in Congress and not illegal immigrants. Plain and simple.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And you don't have to answer the question, that's one thing that's not been pointed out a lot of times. You don't have to answer the question except for how many people are in your household, when it comes to questions protected by the first amendment.</p><p>Fox News' Tucker Carlson got into a very heated debate with an illegal immigrant lawyer. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think that census ought to be allowed to ask people's race?</p><p>CESAR VARGAS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT LAWYER: Well I think we should have a simple count. That's it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes or no.</p><p>VARGAS: And maybe no. I think we shouldn't have immigration status, we shouldn't have about race. We should have say, hey, how many people live in your house, that's it. That's what the Constitution requires. It's all about allocation and representation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, what about male or female, should ask that, should be allowed or is that unconstitutional too?</p><p>VARGAS: Well, I think if a person wants to designate hey, I'm a male, I'm a female, let them -- let them answer that question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: But why -- but hold on, that wasn't the question. The census asks are you a man or a woman, are you non-Hispanic white, are you African- American, are you American-Indian, and now it's going to ask are you a citizen. Only one of the questions bothers you, not because of the constitutionality of it, but because you think it might dilute the political power of illegal aliens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Kayleigh, is asking about citizenship different from asking about race?</p><p>MCENANY: Not at all, Tucker was spot on here and he schooled this lawyer quite handedly for a reason because this lawyer is trying to using to pun our Constitution that aren't there, you have a right to ask all of these questions, the government certainly does, these 12 states that are suing, it's a hoax lawsuit, it will not succeed, this Supreme Court will rebuke them much like they did with the travel pause that was struck down by another liberal judge.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, another conservative commentator, Michelle Malkin says the left wants to use the census as a power grab as I mentioned earlier. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: Only in America does a country get sued for asking who is in it. It is complete insanity. Only in America do have sworn politicians who have taken an oath of office to uphold the laws and Constitution of this country, out there lambasting the Trump administration for asking a very simple question.</p><p>What this is about is about power, more people, more seats, and if you can count illegal aliens as part of that, it's no illegal alien left behind, that's what we're really talking about here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Kayleigh, if this indeed a power grab, as Michelle describes, it, what happens in the midterms? The president's party, 35 of 38 times since the Civil War has lost seats in the House, what makes it different this time, or will the history going to repeat itself.</p><p>MCENANY: Well, I think we're looking quite good for the midterms. But it's important that we make sure that the people who are voting in the midterms are citizens of the United States, and it's important looking 10 years down the road, 6 to 8 years down the road that the number of seats in Congress are determined by the number of citizens in the states.</p><p>Michelle Malkin was spot on. The man in Iowa, the woman in Missouri, and some if these central states that don't have these influxes of illegal immigrant population, they are disenfranchised every time a seat is added to California because they are over counting the number of people that reside in that state.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Kayleigh, thank you very much. Now an entire county is rebelling against California's liberal sanctuary state law. Orange County deciding what the Trump administration vowing to fight back. Next, the mayor of the small California town that started the chain reaction, Los Alamitos mayor with me now is Troy Edgar.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, SUPERVISOR, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: California is trying to poke president in the eye and stir up trouble, and really involve our people by ordering them not to do the job of the federal government, but to not even cooperate with the function of federal law enforcement. And it's not good for our society, and we're tired of being the pawns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Orange County taking a stand defying California's new sanctuary law, voting to join a federal lawsuit against the new state law aimed at telling local officials not to work with federal officials to arrest the felons.</p><p>President Trump appalling the move tweeting, quote, \"My administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their right against California's illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies. California sanctuary laws release known dangerous criminals in the community across the states. All citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders.\"</p><p>This anti-sanctuary vote coming one week after the city of Los Alamitos did the same. With me now is Troy Edgar, the mayor of Los Alamitos. Mayor, it seems like something big has started. I guess, my question is, who's going to get arrested? Is the sheriff going to get arrested? Is the attorney general is going -- because you have a violation here of state law, but you also have a violation of federal law, you can't do both in this situation.</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And so what's the answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EDGAR: Well, at this point -- yes, at this point I would hope no one is going to get arrested at least from the side of sheriff. I think our sheriff in Orange County, Sheriff Hutchens says did a brave move, we watch Sheriff Mims up in Fresno County, you know, these are people that are really trying to figure out a constructive way to do it, just like us on city council and county supervisors are trying to get through either get in or answer a lawsuit going at the U.S. government.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Orange County sheriff, we mentioned, taking a stand publicly posting inmate release states to help federal immigration agents, much to the dislike of the state's attorney general. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDRA HUTCHENS, SHERIFF-CORONER, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: What I'm doing is entirely within the confines of the law, and I'm doing what I think is important for my constituents. It's a public safety issue to me, it's not about immigration at all.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HUTCHENS: It's about individuals who have committed violent crimes, and I don't think I could sleep at night knowing that I let somebody go, and they go out and commit another crime.</p><p>If he is going to arrest me, then he better have some good changes, because I'm going to get an attorney and I'll fight it. But I would be surprised if Mr. Becerra decides to make a move like that and arrest a sitting sheriff for following just because he doesn't like what I'm doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Mayor, you mentioned that you didn't think that anybody would be arrested. I think you're right, but this is a crazy position for the sheriff to be in, for the A.G. to be in, for Jeff Sessions to be in. What happens next?</p><p>Did we lose the sheriff? We lost the sheriff. So, Troy Edgar was the mayor of Los Alamitos. We're going to go to break, but when we come back, you won't believe it.</p><p>Billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg saying he would never sell your information without consent back in 2009. We have the sound.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Breaking news. White House officials confirming that Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin to resign. Officials saying President Trump will nominate his personal physician Ronny Jackson to succeed him.</p><p>Donald J. Trump, the president, tweeting, and I quote, \"I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny Jackson, M.D. ad the new veteran -- secretary of Veterans Affairs. In the interim, honorable Robert Wilkie of DOD, Department of Defense will serve as acting secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and to our great veterans.\"</p><p>New video uncovered. We're going to spun to that in a minute, Gianno. But I want to get first to this -- first, Gianno, I want to -- OK, sorry. Sorry about that. We got breaking news, we got a live TV, we just lost the mayor of an entire city just a second ago on live television, so anything can happen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, POLITICAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS: Wait a minute, he is still alive, right?</p><p>LAYFIELD: We don't know that, he could have got arrested by either the attorney general or Jeff Sessions.</p><p>CALDWELL: My God. No, no, I hope not, I hope not, so he still alive.</p><p>LAYFIELD: So Gianno Caldwell and Katie Frates, your initial thoughts on this, we had an expletive said by one of our cameraman when they heard this that they couldn't believe it.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think a little bit of exasperation, I think you have the same feeling. What do you think President Trump's personal position taking over?</p><p>CALDWELL: Well, honestly, I mean, there's a four -- a few different things that come to mind when I hear a story like this. One, we continue to see the moving chairs on White House in terms of administration that people continue to go and come. And I think for a lot of people they want to see a little bit more stability.</p><p>In terms of the current secretary who just resigned, I know he had solid support among veterans groups. To some this isn't as much as a surprise. I think there was some bumping of the heads within the administration.</p><p>But certainly, when it comes to Trump's personal doctor, how does one feel about him nominating that person when we know President Trump likes to get people that he is very familiar with on a personal note and nominate them to things.</p><p>So that could be pretty good. We've got to find out more about this guy. Because at this time I don't know much about him or anything about him or anything at all, besides the fact that he is Trump's personal physician, do you?</p><p>LAYFIELD: No, I don't, nothing except for the fact that President Trump continues to appear from the outside to have disarray in his office.</p><p>To Katie Frates who actually came on here to talk about Facebook. So, Katie, I hate to surprise you with this news, but it's breaking to us as well. Is this a sign, as Gianno mentioned and I alluded too, that this is disarray in Trump White House. You had hard turnover in the Trump White House by factor of two--</p><p>KATIE FRATES, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- than any administration in history, is this more of the same? And is it disarray?</p><p>FRATES: This is actually the first time I have heard breaking news like this and been relieved by it. I'm really hoping that the exit of Secretary Shulkin is the last in line of V.A. secretaries to have let down the men and women of this country who protect it and who need our help once they come home.</p><p>The V.A. continues to have story after story that lets our veterans down of horrific situation. And I'm hoping while I agree with Gianno, we absolutely need to know more about his nominee, that this can hopefully be a new era for the protection of our veterans when they come home.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, this person may be incredibly qualified, and I hope they are, and I agree with you about the Veterans Administration. I've been to visit Iraq and Afghanistan eight different times, but a lot of Christmases over there with these incredible heroes. I have a soft spot for these guys especially the care that these veterans have once they return.</p><p>But is this more a sign of President Trump just bringing in his inner circle to the White House, and is it more of a sign of disarray. Forget the fact that this person needs to be replaced. Is this a sign of disarray and chaos in White House?</p><p>FRATES: I'm not entirely sure. I mean, we've been hearing disarray and chaos in White House the entire time President Trump has been our president. We've heard that even before he was our president. So I'm not thinking much of this, specifically because Secretary Shulkin was not doing his job.</p><p>So I think we need to take back -- a step back and look and see is this person resigning, and that's a good thing, is that separate from the chaos we may see is there. And I think it is. I think it's a good thing that he is resigning.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Gianno, Rex Tillerson was fired by Twitter. Some would think a person of that distinguished of a career would have deserved a little better than that.</p><p>CALDWELL: Priebus is also went let go and left in an airport field, right?</p><p>LAYFIELD: That is correct.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And is this the Trump administration their style of leadership is this going to work?</p><p>CALDWELL: Well, I got to push back a little bit because I think there has been disarray and chaos within the White House, certainly it looks that way from the outside looking in and this isn't something that is traditional of any presidency, I think President Trump has called himself modern day presidential.</p><p>So with that being the case, I'm hoping that this isn't a revolving door of imagery that we're going to see throughout this White House. But certainly when it comes to case by case, by Tillerson, who some like some didn't, there's other people who have left the White House, there are some like and some didn't.</p><p>When it comes to the veterans this is a very serious issue, and I know there was a group yesterday that said that there was going to be an imminent departure, which there was. And I know Katie wants to jump in there, so go ahead.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Go ahead, Katie.</p><p>FRATES: So actually if you could repeat that I just had something in my ear so I actually can't hear you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, Katie, let me ask you, let me ask you a different question about inclusiveness. The thing against Trump administration is the fact that you bringing in personal friends, you brought in a lot of family.</p><p>FRATES: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And most of the people that are there, you look at Mr. Bolton. You look at Rex Tillerson. You look at Mr. Ross, Secretary Ross. We have an average age of about 80 years old it seems like in this White House. Is this White House really in touch?</p><p>FRATES: Well, absolutely it's concerning to me to see a president who may be surrounding himself and seems like time and time again he is surrounding himself by people who are friends first as opposed to necessarily qualified first, so that's absolutely something that is a concern.</p><p>But I also think we need to be objective in looking at again this, the potential new V.A. secretary his qualification, his relationship with the president aside. But I am I do completely agree with the idea that it seems a little odd when everyone happens to be a close friend.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes, the pattern it seems to be a very suspect, Gianno, I would think.</p><p>CALDWELL: Well, President Trump just called me -- hello, president, I'm a close friend too, so I think he nominated me.</p><p>LAYFIELD: You're going to the White House. Actually -- yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: I'm on my way. I'm on my way.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Actually, Gianno, you are not going anywhere because we also going to talk about Facebook. So that's exactly -- we're going to keep moving guys. You guys get double duty.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: I got new duty.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right. You get breaking news and--</p><p>CALDWELL: So I got breaking news.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- you get to talk about what you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: I just heard the news the new chief of staff of the White House.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think you would be a great pick?</p><p>CALDWELL: Hello, mom, I made it.</p><p>LAYFIELD: You said your mother disown you for--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL: I know I'm a republican but she is goin to love me for being the new chief of staff.</p><p>LAYFIELD: She -- invite her to the White House your mom will love you forever.</p><p>CALDWELL: There you go.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I assure you. First, another hack attack on the U.S. city shutting down substantial forces of Atlanta's government. Cyber expert Morgan Wright thinks something bigger is coming. He'll explain after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have directed the search of security various subject matter experts to work closely with the city's task force to get mission critical systems back on-line as prudently and expeditiously as possible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is much bigger than Ransomware attack. This really is an attack on our government, which means it's an attack on all of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Another hack attack on U.S. city. With Gianno and Katie, I'm not sure if they are coming back that we have breaking news. So we're coverings whatever is in front of us. So I got to throw that damn teleprompter for a minute. I love it.</p><p>Shutting down substantial portions of Atlanta's government of the past week, things still aren't quite back to normal as that city and its officials try to piece together the extent of the damage. Government workers beginning to turn on their computers for the first time since the attack effectively held their systems hostage today.</p><p>I'm joined now with cybersecurity expert, Morgan Wright, here to react to the growing trend. Is -- Morgan, thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate this. We got a little disarray because of breaking news, which is actually a lot of fun to cover a lot of television.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But is this becoming a national security issue.</p><p>WRIGHT: It was a couple years ago, people just tend to realize. Look, John, in 2015, the global damage from Ransonware was $350 million. In 2017, it was $5 billion and it's growing. This is a weaponize form of malicious software and it's design to do one thing on stuff like this. They go after health care, they go after and governments, why, because they have to pay because these are mission-critical services and this stuff is mutating.</p><p>Colorado Department of Transportation off line, can't pay their employees. I mean, this is significant impact, so, yes, I expect -- I expect it to increase over the next three to four years.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Morgan, how does the Ransom actually take place? So you have something held hostage, I understand Ransonware and entire principle, so how do they actually pay whoever this is as perpetrating these crimes?</p><p>WRIGHT: Crypto currency bitcoin is the crypto currency of choice. I mean, these folks have 800 numbers and customer service numbers that would make U.S. corporations, you know, jealous. These guys are good about getting the money out of you. What they do is that, you have to set up an account, you fund that account with bitcoin because it's virtually untraceable.</p><p>And then, for example, in Atlanta I think they want about 50, or $51,000, you know, and that for a city to do this calculation, understand it's going to cost more than that to get our data back. So, unfortunately, some of these cities and counties, Charlotte-Mecklenburg the recent one to have paid the ransom.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Where are these attacks coming from? Is this a sovereign state of these are just hackers around the world that are doing these to destruct commerce and hopefully make, for them, make a little money off of it.</p><p>WRIGHT: They've actually been both. The Wannacry, the Ransomware attack that was North Korea. They actually used some NSA tools the EternalBlue to exploit a vulnerability in Windows in the server in some of these case. These are organize crime groups. A Ransonware manager in Romania or Russia could 150to $200,000 a year and that's significant over there and the people on this team.</p><p>So, it is all over the place, it is state sponsored in some areas, Russia has sponsored this as attacks on Ukraine, but at the same time criminal enterprises are the ones they're after the money, not so much Russia.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And there's more ways that Kim Jong-un is actually financing part of what he is doing--</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- with these sanctions that are crippling because they have a huge cadre of hackers from North Korea that are operating, I believe, out China, correct?</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes, absolutely. In fact, not only China but in places like Thailand, you know, other places outside that. In fact, North Korea attacked a lot of the bitcoin and crypto currency changes -- exchanges in South Korea to do exactly that to start getting some hard currency. Stuff that they've been prohibited from by a lot of these export restrictions.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Over the weekend, a different hack attack disrupting Baltimore's 911 dispatch system for 17 hours. The question, I guess, these people, is this all just about ransom or is this simply a foreign country? Is it tied in to the Russian meddling and Yevgeny Prigozhin and what he had with his IRA that was trolling allegedly the elections?</p><p>WRIGHT: Right. You know, this is interesting too, because as we start moving more towards a network centric environment, it used to be 911 centers were based on copper wire the old stuff, but now they are network base so you can be anywhere.</p><p>So the ability to attack this are increasing. We've got a brand new big public network coming onboard called FirstNet, that's also going to be (Inaudible), so these threats are going to increase.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I only got a couple seconds left, so what's the best way to prevent this.</p><p>WRIGHT: Back up, back up, back up, don't click on suspicious links, and whatever you do if you see something happening call for help right away.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Morgan, that's great stuff. Thank you very much.</p><p>WRIGHT: You bet, John.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Developing news on Shulkin's ouster, our own Connell McShane after this.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Breaking news. White House officials confirming that Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin will resign. Officials saying President Trump will nominate his personal physician Admiral Ronny Jackson to succeed him.</p><p>With more on this is Connell McShane. Connell, can you give us some details on this, please, and explain what's going on in the White House?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: No. Boy, how much time do we have?</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's a lot of question, Connell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm here on the street of Washington covering a completely different story on the news that's break to my right a few blocks down to Pennsylvania Avenue. But you know, I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that David Shulkin is being forced out of this position. That have been a telegraph move from this president that Mr. Shulkin had come under fire for some of the expenses that have been under his, you know, direction when he was the Veterans Affairs secretary particularly this trip to Europe in which his wife went to Europe.</p><p>So, there was, this was a long time coming. But the fact that the president picked his personal physician to take his place that took some people off- guard a little bit. Admiral Jackson has been in the navy for a long time and he's also been the personal physician to the last three presidents.</p><p>But this is a move the president has been looking to make for some time which is a matter of who. The choice is interesting though, I think that surprise a lot of people.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, Connell, you're in D.C., you're a brilliant reporter. This has take you by surprise we have a president who surround himself by his own family and personal friends. And it certainly looks like from the outside in from a 30,000 foot level that this is a sign of disarray and chaos despite the fact that this move itself was a very telegraphed move. But taking his personal physician, does that surprise you?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, a little bit. I mean, I think the White House has been arguing all along when you bring up that narrative that you just mentioned that this is somehow chaotic situation, that the president is just in year two as he moves in trying to surround himself with people he's comfortable with and trying to build an administration where he is comfortable dealing with the people who advise him.</p><p>I would point to you that the John Bolton appointment last week as an example of that. So that's how the White House pushes back on that. But, you know, there is no arguing with the fact that there's been more turnover in this White House in the first year of Trump than there are in normal White House. So that's just a fact.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes. Two extras turnover of any previous administration. I think Ronald Reagan had the previous record which is pretty good company to be in.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But certainly the two ex is something that has raised some alarm. What is the feel in D.C., I mean, you got Congress with approval rating lower than people that believe in big foot for very good reason. What is the feel, I'm not sure who is it that believe in these guys up there in Congress, I guess it's their friends and family.</p><p>But what is the feeling in D.C. about this administration as far as the continual shake-up? It certainly appears from the outside looking in.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, they are in recess now for this weekend.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Of course they are.</p><p>MCSHANE: Or either back on their own districts or they are on an overseas trip or what have you. But I mean, I don't know that today changes anything in terms of what people were already thinking.</p><p>If you are against the president you are going to view the changes that come at high-level as chaotic. If you're somebody who supports the president you are going to say that he just needs to make the type of changes, again, as I said earlier, that he could surround himself with people who are comfortable with.</p><p>So, it's completely depends on which side of the aisle that you come down on and what's your view is going to be on something like that. But again, as I've said before and I've been talking to people that are close to or even in the White House, they maintain that -- they push back hard on that chaotic narrative that people have been putting out there and saying, again, the president is just looking to find people that he's comfortable with.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: And who would you be comfortable with, I guess someone that you work with directly as personal physician. He obviously likes the guys as we saw when he came out, Ronny Jackson, to give the personal -- personal health report for the president there some time ago at the White House.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Connell, we only -- we have less than a minute but I want to ask you this about the midterm election.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>LAYFIELD: The trend is against the president's party 35 of 38 times since the Civil War that the president's party has lost seats. Since 1913 the Senate -- 19 of 26 the president's party has loss seats.</p><p>Anti-incumbent sentiment is ravage around the world. Does this party get wiped out in the midterms as history change?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you could see the president is kind of bracing himself for something wipe out, maybe not the big blue wave that people are looking for that he's been trying to fire up the base to some recent appearance he says he's made of. He keeps talking about the fact that you see this all the time that people get complacent and he's calling on his party to not get complacent. But right now you have the seat advantage as least in the House--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Connell, I don't mean to cut you off, we got to run. We got a hard break coming up and your holiday (Ph) is live on TV.</p><p>Charles Payne is now here with Making Money. My man, Charles, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018032801cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S05-3WR1-DXH2-61TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

The White House announcing its first trade deal  today, unveiling its successfully renegotiated a 6-year-old South Korea- U.S. deal, giving President Trump his first major trade deal since being  elected. </p><p>And the administration saying its maximum pressure campaign is working.  China announcing today in a personal message to President Trump, it met  with North Korea's Kim Jong-un and that the dictator is pledging to  denuclearize. More on that in a minute.</p><p>Also tonight, now an entire county is rebelling against California's  liberal sanctuary state -- sanctuary state law. Orange County fighting with  the Trump administration vowing to fight back. We have the mayor from the  small California town that started the chain reaction. </p><p>Plus, you won't believe it, billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg  saying he would never sell your information without consent. This was back  in 2009. This as the social media giant is facing criticism for how it  handled the personal data of millions of its users today. We'll play you  the sound.</p><p>Tonight, an all-star guest lineup, former deputy assistant to President  George W. Bush, Brad Blakeman, RNC spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, and  cyber security expert Morgan Wright on more U.S. cities being hacked,  global intelligence firm chief executive, R.P. Eddy, and Fox News anchor  Shannon Bream on how she helped a dying boy get his wish, all tonight.</p><p>Politics and money, we got you covered. I'm in for Liz MacDonald. I'm John  Layfield. Risk and Reward starts now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've lost over a fairly  short period of time, 60,000 factories in the country, closed, shuttered,  gone. Six million jobs at least, gone. We have a trade deficit of $504  billion. It's really $375 billion. </p><p>Many different ways of looking at it, anyway you look at it, it is the  largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. With China  we're going to be doing a section 301 trade action. It could be about $60  billion. I'll be signing it right here, right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  The Dow closing the day down just slightly 9 point to 23,848.  The NASDAQ also ending lower for a second day as Amazon and Netflix's  shares drop. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, President Trump stepping up for American workers and businesses  in his first major trade deal since being elected. The U.S. and South Korea  reaching what officials are hailing as a quote, \"innovative trade deal,\"  touted as a roadmap for future negotiations. </p><p>In return for exemption from Trump's 25 percent tariff on steel imports,  South Korea is agreeing to limit its U.S. steel export to roughly 70  percent of its average expert from 2015 to 2017, allow twice as many U.S.  made cars 50,000 for manufacturer enter Korea without meeting local safety  standards, and extend for 20 years a 25 percent tariff on South Korean  pickup trucks exported to the U.S.</p><p>The Trump administration also saying its wrapping up a side deal to deter  South Korea currency devaluations. </p><p>Joining me now is former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush, Brad  Blakeman. Brad, welcome to the show. The trade deal to me, it's the first  unilateral trade deal that we've done, we've dropped down the TPP, we're  looking at negotiating -- renegotiating NAFTA. </p><p>A little bit of window dressing. A 25 percent tariff for the next 20 years  on South Korea pick-ups coming in. There aren't any South Korea imports  coming in, so a little bit of window dressing. And as far as cars going  there only 10,000 go there anyway, so but the main part about this was the  quota. Reducing that by 30 percent of the level from 2015 to 2017. Is this  a good deal? </p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:  It's a  great deal. It's a heck of a lot better than what we had. And the president  is right to get out of this multilateral deals and deal bilaterally with  countries.</p><p>Look, we have, we are sending $23 billion a year to South Korea, and  they're sending back about 2.5 billion, that's not fair trade at all and  can't be considered free trade when they have restrictions that are not  reciprocal on our end. So it's going to take us a while to ramp up the  amount of cars we sell. </p><p>But we can start selling auto parts to them tomorrow. This is a very good  deal and it's just a start, and other countries should wake up because  Donald Trump is going to be knocking on your door very soon. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, we only sold 10,000 cars last year between G.M. and Ford  so it's not going to sell a lot of cars out of this deal, the main deal is  that the trade tariff itself reducing to 30 percent below.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  How does this not just raise prices, and how would this quota,  even though it is a quota not a tariff be different as far as actions that  happened in steel prices rising and jobs being cost in our own country  right here in the United States like the 2002 Bush tariff did on steel? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, what we've got to do is we've got to o look beyond just  this steel and look at steel like we do any other product from a national  global standpoint. </p><p>We are getting screwed. And the status quo is not good enough. And once we  start making more deals you'll see that the deals overall will start  equalizing themselves. But we have to start standing up for the American  worker, and we also have to stand up to unfair trade practices by other  countries, friend and foe alike. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And the fact that there is 140,000 jobs in steel producing  industries and 6.5 million you're not worried about the disparity between  the two that this will affect that 6.5 million much greater than we'll add  jobs that 140,000? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  No, because I think that overall once we get finished with, you  know, leveling the playing field, I think we'll have a great deal of good  to happen, not only to our workforce but also our economy in general. I  think it's about time that we start equalizing the standing that America  has. We are a super power, yet we're treated like just another nation.  Under Obama that was fine. Under Trump unacceptable. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  The media today though, Brad, was not interested in America's  first trade deal. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Did the president direct John Dowd to talk to the  attorneys of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn without potential pardon? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A quick question on Stormy Daniels and the lawsuit that  was offered overnight. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If I could ask you about the president's former lawyer,  John Dowd, are there any actions that Mr. Dowd took while he was serving  the president that President Trump was uncomfortable? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why has he not spoken to Stormy Daniels, Sarah?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is the media missing something here, Brad? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  It's a preoccupation. This is -- this is again just a part of  the resistance that started the day he was the elected president and it  continues. Look, they don't talk about full employment, they don't talk  about interest rates, they don't talk about pretty much nonexistence of  inflation. Look, if it wasn't for bad news, they wouldn't report any news.  And this is -- the American people get it, though. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think you are right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  They really do.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And Brad, thank you very much for your time today. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  My pleasure. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  As the North Korea peace talks draw closer, a reminder how  unhappy the media is about former Ambassador John Bolton as appointment as  our new national security adviser. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This may be the worst thing he has done. He said to  them no more stupid wars, now he brings in the godfather of stupid wars,  John Bolton. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the risk of a war of a shooting war with  Iran, and North Korea are substantially greater than they were this  morning. I think it dramatically increases the risk that a lot of Americans  and Koreans, perhaps Japanese, end up dead. </p><p>JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  John Bolton, he is the  hammer and everything is a nail. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just throwing all the toys in the air, I'm mad, I'm  getting rid of everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Despite all this, my next guest said that there is a silver ling  with Bolton's pick. Global intelligence firm chief executive, R.P. Eddy,  and the author of \"Finding Cassandra to Prevent Catastrophes\" alongside  Richard Clarke, and I think the most -- the best intelligent expert in the  world today. So, R.P. thank you for joining us. </p><p>All of this talks about Bolton, he has his hand on the trigger. He has said  he is for a preemptive strike in Iran and North Korea, but you say there is  a silver lining. </p><p>R.P. EDDY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE:  There is a silver lining,  but John, I don't you to be too optimistic about my view. So, there is a --  there is a -- you know, if you think of a spectrum of political position  inside of the Washington, D,C, beltway policy world, John Bolton lives on  one extreme, there's no doubt about it. But he is still within that one  mainstream dialogue and I think that matters. </p><p>And the thing that matters more to me is Donald Trump unfortunately now  seems to be throwing away a number of good advisers, and believe me, he can  make a lot of decisions on his own, and I don't think that any president on  his own can handle the massive complexity of the presidency. Although I see  him sort of, steering that direction.</p><p>So a guy like John Bolton, though I don't love his policies, in fact, I  really dislike some of them, he is a loud guy, he's got a point of view on  a lot of things and the president will not be able to throw his opinion  away, so at least the president will have a real veteran hand with him. </p><p>And this guy, he understands the State Department, he understands the DOD,  he understand the international negotiations, he understand the U.N. He  doesn't like most of those things but at least he knows how it works, and  at least the president won't be able to ignore him, and that matters to me. </p><p>I want the president to have as much counsel around him as he can. I'm not  speaking about if I love or hate Trump and I didn't since, I just want the  president to have good counsel or at least some wise counsel. And though  John Bolton's positions are different than mine he will give him counsel. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Bolton you say is a loud guy, I think it's fair to say our  president could be classified as the same so you have two loud guys in the  room. And now, North Korea is at the bargaining table, did this come about  because of China stepping up, because of the U.S. And why did they come to  the bargaining table. </p><p>EDDY:  I will always take a pessimistic view on North Korea until I'm  proved wrong until we can begin to be optimistic. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  They've only lied about everything else. </p><p>EDDY:  You got it. And so, look, I think the Olympics was a really smart  thing, it was nice to get everyone kind of, you know, reduce the tensions  that's a valuable thing we bought some time, but time actually serves the  North Koreans not us, right? </p><p>So the next thing North Koreans have to do tactically is they have to prove  that one of their ICBM's can deliver a payload to the United States or  within that kind of radius. Once they do that, they have every card they  need for negotiation. </p><p>And as long as they can delay us from doing a preventive attack which  Bolton wants, which the president is entertained, which McMaster even  entertained, as long as they can prevent that, and it's a great idea to  throw a card out there since they want to negotiate to saw things down,  they can get to the point where they can be able to show that delivery then  they have more to negotiate with. So, it's kind of what I think is going  on. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Would they really disarm? I mean, is this something--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EDDY:  I would love if they did, but never say never. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  But what happens if they don't? </p><p>EDDY:  It depends on your view of this, right. So, it depends very simply.  If you think North Korea can be trusted as a rational safe holder of  nuclear weapons or not. And historically, everything they have said about  nuclear weapons would lead you to that latter position, we really can't  trust these guys, they've never said anything about being responsible  actors.</p><p>Until a few months ago when they came out and said, listen, don't worry  we're not maniacs, we're not going to nuke anybody. We'll be responsible  nuclear actors. If they can continue that dialogue, if they can get some  safe weapon handling procedures and protocols in place, as other countries  did, like India, Pakistan, and Israel, then maybe we can say, look, as much  as we hate the idea we've learned they're not crazy and we can allow them  to have some degree of nuclear weapons. </p><p>If we can't get to that point of view we're in a really tough pickle, and  then all of a sudden the John Bolton ideas, which currently seem crazy seam  less crazy. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And what does the Korean peninsula look like if they do disarm,  do you see a reunification? Do you see this--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EDDY:  Well, if they do disarm they're not doing it because they don't want  to get rid of weapons, they're doing it because they want something massive  in return.</p><p>And you know, the way I kind of joke about it, if the leaders want their  kids to play soccer at Stanford, right, they want to get back into the  world, they want their kids to go play football. And they want to get back  into the world. So it won't be a matter of, you know, business as usual,  they want trade back on, or be at the oil fields that they have offshore  which are massive. </p><p>They'll be back in the community of nations, they'll have their provision  and they want to get going. Now the question then is, can you have a South  Korea, North Korea two country so radically different, will they change  their system of governance or not, will they stop with some of the chemical  weapons issue, the biological weapons issue and the other stuff we care  about. </p><p>But so long as they're back in the community of nations, you know, then you  have a lot of questions out, again, proliferation. These are bad actors on  all sorts of scales. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  This isn't fair. We only have few seconds left, but Russia, are  we doing enough to stop Russia actually hacking into the next election? </p><p>EDDY:  No, we're not. And you know, I know it's contrary to a lot of your  guests on here. This president hasn't done enough to stand up against  Russia. But I was really heartened to see that he kicked these diplomats  out recently. I think that was a good thing joining our NATO our very  special allies in Britain. There is a lot more he needs to do against  Russia in our state.</p><p>Remember, elections are managed at the state level, that means you got  every knucklehead in every small state trying to tell me he can prevent a  hack from Russia, he can't do it. It is a massive vulnerability and it  needs to be fixed.</p><p>Simply every machine needs a paper trail, that simple. That's all you got  to do. They're still hackable but if you leave your voting booth, and you  got a paper certificate that says you voted as you did and you put that in  different bucket, now we have a trail and we don't have to worry as much  about the hacking. It's still a big problem. Twenty two states were hacked  in the last election at least, and if you can see it you can change it as  they say in information operations. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  R.P., I'll put out on Twitter that it was great to have you on  and you're like a Santa Claus. You deliver. </p><p>EDDY:  John, it's always good to see you. Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Great to see you as well. Thank you very much, R.P.</p><p>Let's check your money, stocks down a second day on worries about  regulation of big tech names. Nicole Pettalides is on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange with the latest. Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  John, they did it again. That  volatility is here on Wall Street. Back and forth action throughout the  day. And the Dow was pretty much 50/50 for winners and losers. The Dow  Jones Industrial Average finished down 9, so down two days in a row. The  S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of 1 percent.</p><p>The winners on the Dow, Merck, Wal-Mart, G.E., Travelers and Verizon.  Telecom did very well today. Amazon gets beaten down, this after their  report that President Trump is looking to change the tax treatment of  Amazon, concerns about the mom and pop shops, while all the rest of the  retailers got a pop, J.C. Penney and Sears, all of them with up arrows.  Tesla is to the downside. This, as federal regulators are looking into that  fatal crash. And Moody's was at debt (Ph) its downgrade for Tesla. John?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  It's so much easier to report when stocks are up. Thank you,  Nicole. </p><p>Coming up, a heartwarming story for Easter. Fox News Shannon Bream getting  the help of the Avengers stars to help make a dying boy's wish come true.  Coming up, she is here to talk about how she did it.</p><p>Plus, you won't believe it. Billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg  saying he would never sell your information without consent back in 2009.  We have the sound. </p><p>But first, now at least 12 states are going to sue to block the Trump  administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census. My next  guest think it's ridiculous. RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany joins me  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Let's be realistic about this. Do we think this is  about getting an accurate view of the census, and protecting voting rights,  or is it to in fact suppress minority voting? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This administration that has consistently tried to  suppress voting rights. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Civil rights groups slamming the move saying it could  significantly reduce responses from immigrants fearful of deportation. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Adding the question, could scare off undocumented  immigrants from participating, potentially throwing off federal funding. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Critics say this is about intimidating immigrants and  will result in a population under count, potentially that could lead to  lost congressional seats. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What do you say to critics who argue that ultimately  this is a way to target immigrants?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  The media going haywire over a census question. Now at last 12  states are going to sue to block the Trump administration from asking about  citizenship on the 2020 census. Opponents of the move say the question will  keep even legal immigrants from completing the form which would reduce the  population count in Democratic areas of the country.</p><p>Joining me now is RNC spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany. Kayleigh, welcome to  the show. Is this question, it's been deemed as if it's a political  question. The left says you're trying to suppress immigrant voters, the  right says just exactly the opposite. </p><p>Is this really something that is being used as a power grab for the vote,  the administration or is this simply a question trying to find out who's in  our country?</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, SPOKESPERSON, RNC:  This is trying to find out who is in  our country, and liberals are acting insane here. We're simply trying to  find out who is here, who is a citizen, who is not. And guess why we are  trying to figure that out, because this census will determine how many  representatives each state gets in Congress. </p><p>You look back to 2010, the states that gain seats were Florida, Arizona,  Texas, states that do have heavy illegal immigrant population. So if these  individuals are registering, they appear to be citizens and they get extra  representation for that, that cannot happen.</p><p>We need to have citizens representing in Congress and not illegal  immigrants. Plain and simple. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And you don't have to answer the question, that's one thing  that's not been pointed out a lot of times. You don't have to answer the  question except for how many people are in your household, when it comes to  questions protected by the first amendment. </p><p>Fox News' Tucker Carlson got into a very heated debate with an illegal  immigrant lawyer. Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Do you think that census ought to be  allowed to ask people's race? </p><p>CESAR VARGAS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT LAWYER:  Well I think we should have a  simple count. That's it. </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes or no. </p><p>VARGAS:  And maybe no. I think we shouldn't have immigration status, we  shouldn't have about race. We should have say, hey, how many people live in  your house, that's it. That's what the Constitution requires. It's all  about allocation and representation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, what about male or female, should ask that, should be  allowed or is that unconstitutional too? </p><p>VARGAS:  Well, I think if a person wants to designate hey, I'm a male, I'm  a female, let them -- let them answer that question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON:  But why -- but hold on, that wasn't the question. The census asks  are you a man or a woman, are you non-Hispanic white, are you African- American, are you American-Indian, and now it's going to ask are you a  citizen. Only one of the questions bothers you, not because of the  constitutionality of it, but because you think it might dilute the  political power of illegal aliens. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Kayleigh, is asking about citizenship different from asking  about race? </p><p>MCENANY:  Not at all, Tucker was spot on here and he schooled this lawyer  quite handedly for a reason because this lawyer is trying to using to pun  our Constitution that aren't there, you have a right to ask all of these  questions, the government certainly does, these 12 states that are suing,  it's a hoax lawsuit, it will not succeed, this Supreme Court will rebuke  them much like they did with the travel pause that was struck down by  another liberal judge. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, another conservative commentator, Michelle Malkin says the  left wants to use the census as a power grab as I mentioned earlier. Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR:  Only in America does a country get  sued for asking who is in it. It is complete insanity. Only in America do  have sworn politicians who have taken an oath of office to uphold the laws  and Constitution of this country, out there lambasting the Trump  administration for asking a very simple question. </p><p>What this is about is about power, more people, more seats, and if you can  count illegal aliens as part of that, it's no illegal alien left behind,  that's what we're really talking about here. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Kayleigh, if this indeed a power grab, as Michelle describes,  it, what happens in the midterms? The president's party, 35 of 38 times  since the Civil War has lost seats in the House, what makes it different  this time, or will the history going to repeat itself. </p><p>MCENANY:  Well, I think we're looking quite good for the midterms. But it's  important that we make sure that the people who are voting in the midterms  are citizens of the United States, and it's important looking 10 years down  the road, 6 to 8 years down the road that the number of seats in Congress  are determined by the number of citizens in the states. </p><p>Michelle Malkin was spot on. The man in Iowa, the woman in Missouri, and  some if these central states that don't have these influxes of illegal  immigrant population, they are disenfranchised every time a seat is added  to California because they are over counting the number of people that  reside in that state. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Kayleigh, thank you very much. Now an entire county is rebelling  against California's liberal sanctuary state law. Orange County deciding  what the Trump administration vowing to fight back. Next, the mayor of the  small California town that started the chain reaction, Los Alamitos mayor  with me now is Troy Edgar.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, SUPERVISOR, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:   California is trying  to poke president in the eye and stir up trouble, and really involve our  people by ordering them not to do the job of the federal government, but to  not even cooperate with the function of federal law enforcement. And it's  not good for our society, and we're tired of being the pawns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Orange County taking a stand defying California's new sanctuary  law, voting to join a federal lawsuit against the new state law aimed at  telling local officials not to work with federal officials to arrest the  felons. </p><p>President Trump appalling the move tweeting, quote, \"My administration  stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending  their right against California's illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary  policies. California sanctuary laws release known dangerous criminals in  the community across the states. All citizens have the right to be  protected by federal law and strong borders.\"</p><p>This anti-sanctuary vote coming one week after the city of Los Alamitos did  the same. With me now is Troy Edgar, the mayor of Los Alamitos. Mayor, it  seems like something big has started. I guess, my question is, who's going  to get arrested? Is the sheriff going to get arrested? Is the attorney  general is going -- because you have a violation here of state law, but you  also have a violation of federal law, you can't do both in this situation. </p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  Right. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And so what's the answer. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EDGAR:  Well, at this point -- yes, at this point I would hope no one is  going to get arrested at least from the side of sheriff. I think our  sheriff in Orange County, Sheriff Hutchens says did a brave move, we watch  Sheriff Mims up in Fresno County, you know, these are people that are  really trying to figure out a constructive way to do it, just like us on  city council and county supervisors are trying to get through either get in  or answer a lawsuit going at the U.S. government. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Orange County sheriff, we mentioned, taking a stand publicly  posting inmate release states to help federal immigration agents, much to  the dislike of the state's attorney general. Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDRA HUTCHENS, SHERIFF-CORONER, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  What I'm  doing is entirely within the confines of the law, and I'm doing what I  think is important for my constituents. It's a public safety issue to me,  it's not about immigration at all.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>HUTCHENS:  It's about individuals who have committed violent crimes, and I  don't think I could sleep at night knowing that I let somebody go, and they  go out and commit another crime. </p><p>If he is going to arrest me, then he better have some good changes, because  I'm going to get an attorney and I'll fight it. But I would be surprised if  Mr. Becerra decides to make a move like that and arrest a sitting sheriff  for following just because he doesn't like what I'm doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Mayor, you mentioned that you didn't think that anybody would be  arrested. I think you're right, but this is a crazy position for the  sheriff to be in, for the A.G. to be in, for Jeff Sessions to be in. What  happens next?</p><p>Did we lose the sheriff? We lost the sheriff. So, Troy Edgar was the mayor  of Los Alamitos. We're going to go to break, but when we come back, you  won't believe it. </p><p>Billionaire Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg saying he would never sell  your information without consent back in 2009. We have the sound.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Breaking news. White House officials confirming that Veteran  Affairs Secretary David Shulkin to resign. Officials saying President Trump  will nominate his personal physician Ronny Jackson to succeed him. </p><p>Donald J. Trump, the president, tweeting, and I quote, \"I am pleased to  announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny Jackson,  M.D. ad the new veteran -- secretary of Veterans Affairs. In the interim,  honorable Robert Wilkie of DOD, Department of Defense will serve as acting  secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and  to our great veterans.\" </p><p>New video uncovered. We're going to spun to that in a minute, Gianno. But I  want to get first to this -- first, Gianno, I want to -- OK, sorry. Sorry  about that. We got breaking news, we got a live TV, we just lost the mayor  of an entire city just a second ago on live television, so anything can  happen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, POLITICAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS:  Wait a minute, he is still  alive, right? </p><p>LAYFIELD:  We don't know that, he could have got arrested by either the  attorney general or Jeff Sessions. </p><p>CALDWELL:  My God. No, no, I hope not, I hope not, so he still alive. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  So Gianno Caldwell and Katie Frates, your initial thoughts on  this, we had an expletive said by one of our cameraman when they heard this  that they couldn't believe it.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think a little bit of exasperation, I think you have the same  feeling. What do you think President Trump's personal position taking over? </p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, honestly, I mean, there's a four -- a few different things  that come to mind when I hear a story like this. One, we continue to see  the moving chairs on White House in terms of administration that people  continue to go and come. And I think for a lot of people they want to see a  little bit more stability.</p><p>In terms of the current secretary who just resigned, I know he had solid  support among veterans groups. To some this isn't as much as a surprise. I  think there was some bumping of the heads within the administration. </p><p>But certainly, when it comes to Trump's personal doctor, how does one feel  about him nominating that person when we know President Trump likes to get  people that he is very familiar with on a personal note and nominate them  to things. </p><p>So that could be pretty good. We've got to find out more about this guy.  Because at this time I don't know much about him or anything about him or  anything at all, besides the fact that he is Trump's personal physician, do  you? </p><p>LAYFIELD:  No, I don't, nothing except for the fact that President Trump  continues to appear from the outside to have disarray in his office. </p><p>To Katie Frates who actually came on here to talk about Facebook. So,  Katie, I hate to surprise you with this news, but it's breaking to us as  well. Is this a sign, as Gianno mentioned and I alluded too, that this is  disarray in Trump White House. You had hard turnover in the Trump White  House by factor of two--</p><p>KATIE FRATES, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- than any administration in history, is this more of the same?  And is it disarray? </p><p>FRATES:  This is actually the first time I have heard breaking news like  this and been relieved by it. I'm really hoping that the exit of Secretary  Shulkin is the last in line of V.A. secretaries to have let down the men  and women of this country who protect it and who need our help once they  come home.</p><p>The V.A. continues to have story after story that lets our veterans down of  horrific situation. And I'm hoping while I agree with Gianno, we absolutely  need to know more about his nominee, that this can hopefully be a new era  for the protection of our veterans when they come home. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, this person may be incredibly qualified, and I hope they  are, and I agree with you about the Veterans Administration. I've been to  visit Iraq and Afghanistan eight different times, but a lot of Christmases  over there with these incredible heroes. I have a soft spot for these guys  especially the care that these veterans have once they return.</p><p>But is this more a sign of President Trump just bringing in his inner  circle to the White House, and is it more of a sign of disarray. Forget the  fact that this person needs to be replaced. Is this a sign of disarray and  chaos in White House? </p><p>FRATES:  I'm not entirely sure. I mean, we've been hearing disarray and  chaos in White House the entire time President Trump has been our  president. We've heard that even before he was our president. So I'm not  thinking much of this, specifically because Secretary Shulkin was not doing  his job.</p><p>So I think we need to take back -- a step back and look and see is this  person resigning, and that's a good thing, is that separate from the chaos  we may see is there. And I think it is. I think it's a good thing that he  is resigning.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Gianno, Rex Tillerson was fired by Twitter. Some would think a  person of that distinguished of a career would have deserved a little  better than that.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Priebus is also went let go and left in an airport field, right?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That is correct.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And is this the Trump administration their style of leadership  is this going to work? </p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, I got to push back a little bit because I think there has  been disarray and chaos within the White House, certainly it looks that way  from the outside looking in and this isn't something that is traditional of  any presidency, I think President Trump has called himself modern day  presidential.</p><p>So with that being the case, I'm hoping that this isn't a revolving door of  imagery that we're going to see throughout this White House. But certainly  when it comes to case by case, by Tillerson, who some like some didn't,  there's other people who have left the White House, there are some like and  some didn't. </p><p>When it comes to the veterans this is a very serious issue, and I know  there was a group yesterday that said that there was going to be an  imminent departure, which there was. And I know Katie wants to jump in  there, so go ahead. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Go ahead, Katie. </p><p>FRATES:  So actually if you could repeat that I just had something in my  ear so I actually can't hear you.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, Katie, let me ask you, let me ask you a different question  about inclusiveness. The thing against Trump administration is the fact  that you bringing in personal friends, you brought in a lot of family.</p><p>FRATES:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And most of the people that are there, you look at Mr. Bolton.  You look at Rex Tillerson. You look at Mr. Ross, Secretary Ross. We have an  average age of about 80 years old it seems like in this White House. Is  this White House really in touch? </p><p>FRATES:  Well, absolutely it's concerning to me to see a president who may  be surrounding himself and seems like time and time again he is surrounding  himself by people who are friends first as opposed to necessarily qualified  first, so that's absolutely something that is a concern. </p><p>But I also think we need to be objective in looking at again this, the  potential new V.A. secretary his qualification, his relationship with the  president aside. But I am I do completely agree with the idea that it seems  a little odd when everyone happens to be a close friend. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes, the pattern it seems to be a very suspect, Gianno, I would  think. </p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, President Trump just called me -- hello, president, I'm a  close friend too, so I think he nominated me. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  You're going to the White House. Actually -- yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL:  I'm on my way. I'm on my way.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Actually, Gianno, you are not going anywhere because we also  going to talk about Facebook. So that's exactly -- we're going to keep  moving guys. You guys get double duty. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL:  I got new duty. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right. You get breaking news and--</p><p>CALDWELL:  So I got breaking news.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- you get to talk about what you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALDWELL:  I just heard the news the new chief of staff of the White House. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think you would be a great pick?</p><p>CALDWELL:  Hello, mom, I made it. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  You said your mother disown you for--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALDWELL:  I know I'm a republican but she is goin to love me for being the  new chief of staff. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  She -- invite her to the White House your mom will love you  forever. </p><p>CALDWELL:  There you go. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I assure you. First, another hack attack on the U.S. city  shutting down substantial forces of Atlanta's government. Cyber expert  Morgan Wright thinks something bigger is coming. He'll explain after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have directed the search of security various subject  matter experts to work closely with the city's task force to get mission  critical systems back on-line as prudently and expeditiously as possible. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is much bigger than Ransomware attack. This  really is an attack on our government, which means it's an attack on all of  us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Another hack attack on U.S. city. With Gianno and Katie, I'm not  sure if they are coming back that we have breaking news. So we're coverings  whatever is in front of us. So I got to throw that damn teleprompter for a  minute. I love it. </p><p>Shutting down substantial portions of Atlanta's government of the past  week, things still aren't quite back to normal as that city and its  officials try to piece together the extent of the damage. Government  workers beginning to turn on their computers for the first time since the  attack effectively held their systems hostage today. </p><p>I'm joined now with cybersecurity expert, Morgan Wright, here to react to  the growing trend. Is -- Morgan, thank you very much for joining us. I  appreciate this. We got a little disarray because of breaking news, which  is actually a lot of fun to cover a lot of television. </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But is this becoming a national security issue. </p><p>WRIGHT:  It was a couple years ago, people just tend to realize. Look,  John, in 2015, the global damage from Ransonware was $350 million. In 2017,  it was $5 billion and it's growing. This is a weaponize form of malicious  software and it's design to do one thing on stuff like this. They go after  health care, they go after and governments, why, because they have to pay  because these are mission-critical services and this stuff is mutating. </p><p>Colorado Department of Transportation off line, can't pay their employees.  I mean, this is significant impact, so, yes, I expect -- I expect it to  increase over the next three to four years.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Morgan, how does the Ransom actually take place? So you have  something held hostage, I understand Ransonware and entire principle, so  how do they actually pay whoever this is as perpetrating these crimes? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Crypto currency bitcoin is the crypto currency of choice. I mean,  these folks have 800 numbers and customer service numbers that would make  U.S. corporations, you know, jealous. These guys are good about getting the  money out of you. What they do is that, you have to set up an account, you  fund that account with bitcoin because it's virtually untraceable. </p><p>And then, for example, in Atlanta I think they want about 50, or $51,000,  you know, and that for a city to do this calculation, understand it's going  to cost more than that to get our data back. So, unfortunately, some of  these cities and counties, Charlotte-Mecklenburg the recent one to have  paid the ransom. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Where are these attacks coming from? Is this a sovereign state  of these are just hackers around the world that are doing these to destruct  commerce and hopefully make, for them, make a little money off of it. </p><p>WRIGHT:  They've actually been both. The Wannacry, the Ransomware attack  that was North Korea. They actually used some NSA tools the EternalBlue to  exploit a vulnerability in Windows in the server in some of these case.  These are organize crime groups. A Ransonware manager in Romania or Russia  could 150to $200,000 a year and that's significant over there and the  people on this team.</p><p>So, it is all over the place, it is state sponsored in some areas, Russia  has sponsored this as attacks on Ukraine, but at the same time criminal  enterprises are the ones they're after the money, not so much Russia. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And there's more ways that Kim Jong-un is actually financing  part of what he is doing--</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- with these sanctions that are crippling because they have a  huge cadre of hackers from North Korea that are operating, I believe, out  China, correct? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely. In fact, not only China but in places like  Thailand, you know, other places outside that. In fact, North Korea  attacked a lot of the bitcoin and crypto currency changes -- exchanges in  South Korea to do exactly that to start getting some hard currency. Stuff  that they've been prohibited from by a lot of these export restrictions. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Over the weekend, a different hack attack disrupting Baltimore's  911 dispatch system for 17 hours. The question, I guess, these people, is  this all just about ransom or is this simply a foreign country? Is it tied  in to the Russian meddling and Yevgeny Prigozhin and what he had with his  IRA that was trolling allegedly the elections? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Right. You know, this is interesting too, because as we start  moving more towards a network centric environment, it used to be 911  centers were based on copper wire the old stuff, but now they are network  base so you can be anywhere. </p><p>So the ability to attack this are increasing. We've got a brand new big  public network coming onboard called FirstNet, that's also going to be  (Inaudible), so these threats are going to increase. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I only got a couple seconds left, so what's the best way to  prevent this. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Back up, back up, back up, don't click on suspicious links, and  whatever you do if you see something happening call for help right away. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Morgan, that's great stuff. Thank you very much. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, John.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Developing news on Shulkin's ouster, our own Connell McShane  after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Breaking news. White House officials confirming that Veterans  Affairs Secretary David Shulkin will resign. Officials saying President  Trump will nominate his personal physician Admiral Ronny Jackson to succeed  him.</p><p>With more on this is Connell McShane. Connell, can you give us some details  on this, please, and explain what's going on in the White House? </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS:  No. Boy, how much time do we  have?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's a lot of question, Connell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  I'm here on the street of Washington covering a completely  different story on the news that's break to my right a few blocks down to  Pennsylvania Avenue. But you know, I don't think it's a surprise to anybody  that David Shulkin is being forced out of this position. That have been a  telegraph move from this president that Mr. Shulkin had come under fire for  some of the expenses that have been under his, you know, direction when he  was the Veterans Affairs secretary particularly this trip to Europe in  which his wife went to Europe. </p><p>So, there was, this was a long time coming. But the fact that the president  picked his personal physician to take his place that took some people off- guard a little bit. Admiral Jackson has been in the navy for a long time  and he's also been the personal physician to the last three presidents.</p><p>But this is a move the president has been looking to make for some time  which is a matter of who. The choice is interesting though, I think that  surprise a lot of people. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, Connell, you're in D.C., you're a brilliant reporter. This  has take you by surprise we have a president who surround himself by his  own family and personal friends. And it certainly looks like from the  outside in from a 30,000 foot level that this is a sign of disarray and  chaos despite the fact that this move itself was a very telegraphed move.  But taking his personal physician, does that surprise you? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, a little bit. I mean, I think the White House has been  arguing all along when you bring up that narrative that you just mentioned  that this is somehow chaotic situation, that the president is just in year  two as he moves in trying to surround himself with people he's comfortable  with and trying to build an administration where he is comfortable dealing  with the people who advise him. </p><p>I would point to you that the John Bolton appointment last week as an  example of that. So that's how the White House pushes back on that. But,  you know, there is no arguing with the fact that there's been more turnover  in this White House in the first year of Trump than there are in normal  White House. So that's just a fact. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes. Two extras turnover of any previous administration. I think  Ronald Reagan had the previous record which is pretty good company to be  in.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But certainly the two ex is something that has raised some  alarm. What is the feel in D.C., I mean, you got Congress with approval  rating lower than people that believe in big foot for very good reason.  What is the feel, I'm not sure who is it that believe in these guys up  there in Congress, I guess it's their friends and family. </p><p>But what is the feeling in D.C. about this administration as far as the  continual shake-up? It certainly appears from the outside looking in.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, they are in recess now for this weekend.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Of course they are. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Or either back on their own districts or they are on an overseas  trip or what have you. But I mean, I don't know that today changes anything  in terms of what people were already thinking. </p><p>If you are against the president you are going to view the changes that  come at high-level as chaotic. If you're somebody who supports the  president you are going to say that he just needs to make the type of  changes, again, as I said earlier, that he could surround himself with  people who are comfortable with. </p><p>So, it's completely depends on which side of the aisle that you come down  on and what's your view is going to be on something like that. But again,  as I've said before and I've been talking to people that are close to or  even in the White House, they maintain that -- they push back hard on that  chaotic narrative that people have been putting out there and saying,  again, the president is just looking to find people that he's comfortable  with. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And who would you be comfortable with, I guess someone that you  work with directly as personal physician. He obviously likes the guys as we  saw when he came out, Ronny Jackson, to give the personal -- personal  health report for the president there some time ago at the White House.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Connell, we only -- we have less than a minute but I want to ask  you this about the midterm election. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  The trend is against the president's party 35 of 38 times since  the Civil War that the president's party has lost seats. Since 1913 the  Senate -- 19 of 26 the president's party has loss seats.</p><p>Anti-incumbent sentiment is ravage around the world. Does this party get  wiped out in the midterms as history change?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you could see the president is kind of bracing himself for  something wipe out, maybe not the big blue wave that people are looking for  that he's been trying to fire up the base to some recent appearance he says  he's made of. He keeps talking about the fact that you see this all the  time that people get complacent and he's calling on his party to not get  complacent. But right now you have the seat advantage as least in the  House--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Connell, I don't mean to cut you off, we got to run. We got a  hard break coming up and your holiday (Ph) is live on TV.</p><p>Charles Payne is now here with Making Money. My man, Charles, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

He joins us from London, and Phil, what more did these seven say about why they're quitting the Labour Party.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Kristie, Brexit looms over this as it does every aspect of British politics at the moment, but the problems within the Labour Party are deeper and wider than just that one enormous issue, and so that is why people have been speculating about a possible split within the party for some time.</p><p>But there is no doubt on this occasion, Brexit policy is key.  The seven resigning MPs are all passionately in favor of another referendum on the issue and is an idea the Labour Party leadership has not embraced.  These seven are also upset and angry at the Party's efforts or lack of them when it comes to dealing with anti-Semitism among the Labour Party leadership and more broadly, these are people who are concerned with the ideological gulf that opened up really with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn at the leadership of the Party ever since he has steered the Party quite dramatically to the left.</p><p>So all of these things were discussed and explained by these resigning MPs as they explain to people why they are now leaving a party they were once very much dedicated to.  Take a listen to some of their comments from today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS LESLIE, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP:  British politics is now well and truly broken.  The evidence of Labour's betrayal on Europe is now visible for all to see.</p><p>LUCIANA BERGER, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP:  I cannot remain in a Party that I have today come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.</p><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP:  The last few years have shown the established parties are simply not up to this challenge.  They can't be the change because they have become the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLACK:  So, this group is not establishing another party, a new party, not yet anyway, but they are organized.  They've got a website.  They say they will be sitting in Parliament as the independent group.  It is a dramatic day for the British Labour Party, but its impact on wider politics in this country will really depend what happens next and crucially whether or not other MPs join them, not just MPs from the Labour Party, but MPs perhaps from the ruling Conservative Party as well.  That's what these seven say they want to happen -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  A dramatic day in British politics.  Phil Black reporting live for us.  Phil, thank you.  And the political dysfunction also playing out in full force on the other side of the Atlantic.  The White House, on the defensive after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall.</p><p>In the coming hours, the progressive group, Move On, is sponsoring protests to denounce what they call a dangerous power grab.  But President Trump, he is doubling down.  A White House adviser suggests he is prepared to issue the first veto of his presidency if Congress votes down his national emergency declaration.  Here's what Stephen Miller told Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Will the President veto that, which would be the first veto of his presidency?</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, SENIOR ADVISER TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, obviously, the President is going to protect his national emergency declaration, Chris, and I know that we're out of time, but again, I want to make this point.  There is no threat --</p><p>WALLACE:  So yes, he will veto?</p><p>MILLER:  He is going to protect his national emergency declaration guaranteed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  A move like that would no doubt trigger a contentious drawn-out battle on Capitol Hill.  Now, Mr. Trump is already facing legal challenges to the move.  California's Attorney General is promising to file a lawsuit imminently.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a new interview, the former acting FBI Director, Andrew McCabe says Mr. Trump's own words about the Russia probe are what landed him under investigation.</p><p>[08:05:07]</p><p>LU STOUT:  Shortly after declaring a national emergency, President Trump headed to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and that's where find our Sarah Westwood.  Sarah, thank you for joining us.  As we heard from Stephen Miller, his former adviser saying that the President's would use his veto power if Congress acts.  How does the White House plan to defend against legal action when the courts take action?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN:  Well, Kristie, good morning and White House officials say this declaration was prepared with these inevitable legal and congressional challenges in mind.</p><p>They spent weeks putting this together and they are set to face lawsuits from California and at least six other states from the ACLU and other groups challenging the constitutionality of this declaration.  That resolution of disapproval is also likely to find some support in the Senate.  House Democrats already preparing to move forward with that.</p><p>We already have heard some Republicans make the argument that the national emergency declaration is not a subversion of the will of Congress because Congress did include some funding for a border barrier in the spending package that President Trump signed on Friday and because lawmakers have consistently funded barriers along the southern border over the past few years.</p><p>So this is simply the President adding more funding to something that Congress itself has chosen to appropriate.  Critics of the move of course accuse the President of trying to go around the will of Congress which had the opportunity to give the President more funding for his border wall after weeks of negotiations, declined to, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  The President also is under pressure because of that interview that Andrew McCabe gave to CBS aired over the weekend, what more did McCabe, the former acting FBI Director, say about exactly why top officials decided to open that probe into President Trump?</p><p>WESTWOOD:  McCabe said there were a few events that FBI agents looked at before opening that counter-intelligence probe.  One of them was the President directly tying the Russia investigation to his decision on May 2017 to fire former FBI Director, James Comey; another was the President telling Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting that the firing of Comey had relieved quote, \"great pressure\" on him.</p><p>So that combination of things combined with the President's continuing attacks on the Russia investigation convinced McCabe, according to him, to open that counter-intelligence probe which of course was ultimately folded into the work that Special Counsel, Robert Mueller is been doing once he was appointed.</p><p>There has been some back and forth between the Justice Department and McCabe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saying that he said in jest that he would wear a wire to the White House to record President Trump.  McCabe said that was a serious suggestion.</p><p>President Trump has been hitting back on Twitter attacking McCabe highlighting the fact that McCabe was fired from the FBI for failing to be truthful with investigators about a series of leaks.  So there has been some back and forth between McCabe and the President as the former acting FBI Director is speaking out -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Sarah Westwood reporting live from Mar-a-Lago, thank you.</p><p>CNN has exclusive details of potential breaks in relations between the U.S. and North Korea, ahead of the second Trump-Kim Summit later month.  Our senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski is live in Washington with more and Michelle, what are sources telling you about a possible diplomatic upgrade between the U.S. and North Korea?</p><p>MICHELLE KOSINSKI, SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Hi, Kristie.  Well, you know there has been this big question looming just days away from the second Trump-Kim Summit.  But what could possibly come out of this?  Because so far North Korea has done really nothing significant towards denuclearization and there is so little confidence that they are prepared to do anything any time soon.</p><p>So now, diplomatic sources are telling us that there are serious discussions between the U.S. and North Korea to begin to exchange diplomats, although this would be very preliminary.  It would be an exchange of what we call liaison officers.  So diplomats on each side, there would be several, they would go to each other's countries and establish an office there called a liaison office and this would be kind of a first step towards any kind of real diplomatic relationship between the two countries.  But it would be different, kind of a precursor to establishing real diplomatic ties that you would normally see, say, between two countries that get along.</p><p>This was attempted before back in 1994, when there was another massive working towards denuclearization in North Korea.  It got to the point that the U.S. actually leased space in North Korea to establish a liaison office.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>KOSINSKI:  North Korea looked at sites in Washington, D.C. for the same, but by the end of the following year, after all of this discussion, North Korea completely pulled the plug on it.  So at this point, all we know is that there are serious discussions going on about this.  This is a serious consideration.  It might even be announced at the upcoming summit in Vietnam.</p><p>However, a big question mark that still hangs over, of course is, is the U.S. requiring anything specific of North Korea towards denuclearization before something like this could happen -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  A possible new deliverable being announced to you through sources ahead of the next Trump-Kim Summit.  Michelle Kosinski reporting live for us.  Michelle, thank you.</p><p>Now, the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe is refusing to comment on Donald Trump's claim that Mr. Abe nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize last year after his Summit with Kim Jong-un.  A Japanese newspaper reported that Mr. Abe did so after the U.S. government informally sought his support.  Now, here is what the Prime Minister said in a lower House of Parliament earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHINZO ABE, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (Through a translator):  As I said earlier, I am not saying that this is not the fact.  If you allow me to repeat, President Trump has been working towards solving North Korea's missile issues decisively.  I put a high value on President Trump's leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Not quite an answer there.  Now, the White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report.</p><p>A new report by the \"Financial Times\" says the United Kingdom believes it can handle any security risks posed by the Chinese telecom giant, Huawei as it builds next generation 5G wireless that works around the world, but the U.S. government doesn't agree.  It has been pushing for Huawei's technology to be banned, alleging that it could be used by China for spying, something that the the company strenuously denies.</p><p>Samuel Burke joins us now from London with more.  And Samuel first, what exactly is Britain's National Cybersecurity Center saying about the risks posed by Huawei?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Kristie, it's quite interesting because the Cybersecurity Center is saying that they have unique understanding over Huawei's engineering and security capabilities, so you could interpret that as being, \"Listen, even if somebody or some country wanted to use the Huawei equipment to eavesdrop or manipulate data, we would be able to spot that and fix that.\"</p><p>And I have to tell you that is much more in line from what we've heard from cybersecurity experts, not the cybersecurity experts from governments, but from private cybersecurity experts who say even if there were some type of flaw in the Huawei equipment that allowed them to do something nefarious, governments would be able to find it and fix it.</p><p>So with that in mind, I just want to put on the screen three takeaways from yet another round of Huawei.  Number one, we have to remember here what we're hearing from telecom CEOs is very different.  One CEO even told me here in the U.K. that he believes that the U.K. is taking orders from the U.S. because of Brexit, because he feels there is so much pressure on the U.K. to get a trade deal with the U.S. that they're taking orders from the U.S. and other European countries as well.</p><p>Number two, in spite of everything happening with Huawei, new numbers show us that Huawei is crushing Apple in China and Huawei says they haven't changed their sights set on replacing Samsung as the number one provider of smartphones in the world by next year.</p><p>And number three, you have to remember that it's not easy to replace Huawei.  We hear from so many countries and from so many telecoms companies that taking out Huawei would make it much harder for them to bring 5G by this year and next year, because the other equipment may not be as good and would be much more costly -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Fascinating, so if Huawei is a risk or not a risk or manageable risk, the debate just goes on.  Samuel Burke reporting live for us, thank you.  Now to the latest controversy involving Facebook.</p><p>A British Parliamentary Committee has just released a report on social media disinformation after revealing internal Facebook e-mails, and this is what they found.  The social media platform quote, \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and competition laws.\"</p><p>Now, the e-mail showed that Facebook was quote, \"willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to app developers.\"  Now, lawmakers also claim that the document showed that the social network was able to \"starve\" some developers of data and force them out of business.</p><p>Let's bring in Carole Cadwalladr, she is journalist for \"The Guardian\" as well as \"The Observer,\" and she is one of the reporters who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  She joins us from London.  Carole, thank you for joining us here on the program.  You call this new U.K. government report a fake news and disinformation a landmark report.  Why is that?</p><p>CAROLE CADWALLADR, JOURNALIST, THE GUARDIAN/OBSERVER, U.K.:  It's so comprehensive, it looks at this entire landscape of big tech companies, digital campaigning, fake news, Cambridge Analytica and so much more and it is completely damming about Facebook.</p><p>[08:15:10]</p><p>CADWALLADR:  It accuses Mark Zuckerberg of holding the Parliament in contempt and of its senior executives actually deliberately setting out to deceive Parliament in seeking answers.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, as you point out, it's a comprehensive report.  It's a damning report as well, you know, accusing the Facebook founder of contempt saying that Facebook has behaved like a digital gangster that considers itself ahead of and beyond the law.  Were you taken aback or surprised by that strong language?</p><p>CADWALLADR:  No, because we have seen over many, many months that the U.K. Parliament and then it was joined by eight other Parliaments from around the world has really tried to hold Facebook to account and to summon Mark Zuckerberg to Britain to answer these questions, and time and time again, Facebook has refused.  And I think Parliament just ran out of patience.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, Facebook has responded to this Parliamentary report.  It's U.K. Public Policy Manager said in a statement this that the company quote, \"supports effective privacy legislation\" and is also open to quote, \"meaningful regulation.\"  So your thoughts on that response from Facebook and also the big question, will the British government act?</p><p>CADWALLADR:  Well, I find that quite an astonishing response from Facebook because many of the laws were actually in place and it deliberately set out to break them.  That's what the evidence of the report is saying.  We had laws and it broke them.</p><p>So I find that a curious answer from Facebook, and as to whether the British government will respond, that's to be seen, I certainly hope so.  One of the things in the report, it has made very clear is that our electoral laws simply don't work in this new age of digital campaigning and it says, they are not fit the purpose.</p><p>And then there's a third aspect of the report, which is very interesting and that is where the report calls out foreign interference in British elections and it calls out the government for being completely silent on this subject and it is calling for an independent investigation into all elections in Britain since 2014.  I think that's very significant. I think the government is going to try and want to dodge answering questions on that.  I really hope the MPs don't allow it to get away with it.</p><p>LU STOUT:  And speaking of foreign interference also on your radar, a Cambridge Analytica employee named Brittany Kaiser has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller is part of the Russia probe into collusion with the Trump campaign.  How big is this?</p><p>CADWALLADR:  Well, we broke this story yesterday in \"The Observer\" and CNN did a great report on it as well today, and I think it's very significant because it is the -- Kaiser is the second employee of Cambridge Analytica who we know has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller.</p><p>What's so interesting about her is that she worked on the Trump campaign, but she also worked on the Brexit campaign.  And in Britain, we've been really desperately trying to ignore Mueller's inquiry into Trump-Russia collusion, and the fact that so many threads of it seem to go through London.  But the case is now becoming un-ignorable, and that's why it does feel very important.</p><p>And again, again, we really need the government to respond to this and tell us that it is taking this Russian interference threat very seriously.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, foreign interference, fake news, disinformation, all the threads coming to a head yet again, with this new report out.  Carole Cadwalladr joining us from London.  Thank you so much for your reporting and take care.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream\" and still ahead, just days after a horrendous car bomb left scenes like these in Indian-administered Kashmir, there is new violence.  We'll get the response from both sides of the border.</p><p>And staying in Pakistan, the Saudi Crown Prince visits to make major announcements, find out what they are, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:20:00]</p><p>LU STOUT:  There has been new violence at a flash point between two nuclear armed nations -- India and Pakistan.  Four Indian troops have been killed in a gunfight with militants in Indian-administered Kashmir.  This is days after a car bomb exploded in the same area.  India has accused Pakistan of being behind the violence, claims that Islamabad denies.  Now for more, let's speak to both Sophia Safi in Islamabad, and Nikhil Kumar in New Delhi.  Hello to you both and Nikhil, we'll start with you.  India troops were killed in this clash in Kashmir.  How did it unfold?  Exactly what happened?</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, INDIA BUREAU CHIEF, CNN:  So, Kristie, Indian authorities tell us that they had intelligence telling them that there was militants hiding out in this area in Indian-administered Kashmir.  They sent in troops to investigate, to follow up on that intelligence.  As they approached a target house, a house that they had focused on where they thought the militants were hiding, they were met with oncoming gunfire.</p><p>In that gun fight, four Indian troops as you said, and one civilian were fatally injured.  Two militants were also killed.  Indian authorities are yet to determine which group these militants were affiliated with and they are still combing the area to work out if there are more militants on the loose in that area.</p><p>But of course, this all comes just days after that massive car bomb attack which left 40 Indian troops dead, paramilitaries dead in Indian-administered Kashmir, the worst attack there in several decades on Indian forces which has inflamed tensions on the subcontinent and let to calls in India for action against Pakistan.</p><p>The Indian authorities say that that car bomb attack last week, that Pakistan had quote, \"a direct hand in it.\"  Pakistan of course denies this, and those tensions have really inflamed politicians' political rhetoric across the political spectrum.  There have been calls from everywhere.</p><p>And so this attack today, four more killed, plays into that tension.  It has led to more calls for action against Pakistan, that again, as I say, in this case, India hasn't yet said which group was involved.  They're still investigating it -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  So Sophia, Indian authorities, they are accusing Pakistan of being behind this spike of violence in Kashmir, so how is Pakistan responding?</p><p>SOPHIA SAFI, PRODUCER, CNN:  Well, Kristie, initially when this event actually took place, when this attack happened, there wasn't really much of a response from Pakistan, which is kind of unusual considering the kind of rhetoric that was coming from across the border.</p><p>Now, in previous situations like this, we have seen very strong comments coming back and forth.  There has been a volley almost of insults being hurled across back and forth from border.  This time, we saw MOFA release one short statement.  Initially, it was just a tweet condemning the incident and saying that if Pakistan was not behind this, there was a longer statement that came out last night calling India's reaction a knee-jerk statement, a knee-jerk reaction, claiming that India is being belligerent and war mongering and what is unusual -- the possibility of this being unusual is because of the timing of this attack.</p><p>This happened right before a landmark visit by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.  It happened just the day before.  He was due to arrive and it also happened the weekend before there was an Afghan-Taliban delegation due to arrive in Islamabad.</p><p>So diplomatically, this was a very sensitive - this was a very sensitive weekend for the country.  Normally, you have the Pakistani military spokesperson consistently and constantly making statements against India whenever even a small incident occurs.  So it's been very quiet comparatively on this front.</p><p>[08:25:10]</p><p>SAFI:  We are expecting more statements after - you know, today has passed because MBS has just left Pakistan, so it remains to be seen how this does play out, but it is something that is causing massive concerns here amongst analysts in Pakistan -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, with Kashmir emerging as a flash point, yet again.  Nikhil Kumar reporting live from New Delhi.  Sophia Safi reporting live from Islamabad.  Thank you to you both and Sophia stick around.  We are going to talk again very, very shortly.</p><p>As Sophia reported just then, the situation in Kashmir is overshadowing a major visit from one of the country's major allies, Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman left Islamabad a short time ago.  He spent the day there as part of a tour of Asia that will also include India and China.</p><p>Now, let's go back to Sophia standing by in Islamabad.  And Sophia, Pakistan really rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi Crown Prince and has Pakistan been richly rewarded?</p><p>SAFI:  Well, you know, there has been a signing of agreements between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which amounted to about $20 billion.  Now, this is a massive amount of investment in the country.  I spoke to the Chairman of the Board of Investment, and according to him, this is the largest ever investment in recent history in Pakistan by another country.</p><p>Now, apart from that, there's also been an announcement by the Saudi Crown Prince that he is going to be -- that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is going to be releasing over 2,000 Pakistani prisoners languishing in jails across Saudi Arabia, this was a request that was made by Prime Minister Imran Khan at a state banquet on Sunday night.</p><p>So it was very surprising that the decision was made immediately the next morning.  It's been welcomed by human rights activists, but again, there is a massive economic crisis in Pakistan.  The country is on the brink of another economic bailout from the IMF, so this will actually soften that kind of situation that Pakistan is currently facing.</p><p>Apart from that, what some critics are saying is that this renewal of ties with Saudi Arabia might prove problematic when it comes to Pakistan's relationship with allies in China, in Turkey, in Qatar, as well as in Iran.  So generally, a positive vibe here in Pakistan, but you know, he has got another two countries to visit - China and India.  So it remains to be seen what developments will come out of that, and how this will play out in the months to come -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Sophia Safi, we thank you for your reporting.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still ahead, U.S. Senator, Marco Rubio says humanitarian aid to Venezuela will get through with or without the help of President Maduro.  We are live in Caracas, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:25:08]</p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, you're watching \"News Stream.\"  And these are your world headlines.  Seven members of Britain's Labour Party have abruptly resigned saying that they are embarrassed and ashamed of their Party's handling of Brexit.  They also expressed their lack of confidence in Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn and the handling of a growing scandal over anti-Semitism.</p><p>A newly released report by a British lawmakers conclude that Facebook quote \"intentionally and knowingly violated privacy and competition laws.\"  It also find its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg showed contempt toward the British Parliament by refusing to testify before them.  Facebook denies the accusations.</p><p>Haiti's government is calling on residents to return to normal activities today.  Ten days of violence have gripped the country with deadly protests against soaring inflation and allegations of widespread government corruption.  Hundreds have gathered to try to stock up on fuel and water, now in scarce supply.  It's not even clear how many people have been killed and injured in the unrest in Haiti.  Many cannot get to treatment and hospitals are overwhelmed.</p><p>Let's go straight to Sam Kiley.  He has been reporting in Port-Au-Prince.  He joins us now live, and Sam, the government is calling for this return to normal, but what's the situation today there in Haiti?</p><p>SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, there hasn't been a mass return to normal, Kristie nor has been a return to the sort of riots that cursed this country for the previous nine days.  Yesterday, the opposition tried to get some demonstrations off the ground, but they -- if you'll excuse the pundit, fully catch fire.</p><p>This morning though, we are getting a slightly mysterious story coming from government authorities alleging that five Americans among a small group of seven or eight other foreign nationals have been arrested in possession of weapons and accused of criminal conspiracy.  They haven't yet been charged.  We don't know what the charges are.  There is not yet any kind of suggestion directly from the government of some kind of political activity, but that is certainly serving as a distraction for Haitians from the day-to-day realities here which is a very, very tough life.</p><p>Indeed, in the last 48 hours, people have been stocking up on cooking gas, on gasoline for their cars, on water which is extremely short supply here in the capital, Port-Au-Prince, Kristie, but that is following nine days really when an awful lot of people, most people indeed, were unable to leave their homes amid this paroxysm of violence that was a result of an explosion of anger marking the anniversary of the second year of the President coming to office.</p><p>Now, of course, they're demanding he step down.  The Prime Minister stepped in a couple of days ago saying that there would be the launch of a commission to investigate corruption and to name names in that process.  That may have drawn the sting for now.  But Haitians remain extremely angry and extremely frustrated with their government -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Too early to call a return to calm there in Haiti.  Sam Kiley reporting live for us.  Sam, thank you.</p><p>Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido is setting up a showdown with his political rival over the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid.  He is calling on a million volunteers to help to bring supplies into the country by Saturday.  The aid has been piling up in neighboring Columbia because sitting President Nicolas Maduro has refused to let it in.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is expected to mention the Venezuela crisis during a speech in Miami later on Monday.  On Sunday, U.S. Republican Senator, Marco Rubio had this message for President Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUBIO:  Well, the aid is going to get through, and I think ultimately, the question is whether it gets through in a way that he is cooperative with or in a way that he is not.  But there is no way you're going to stand ultimately in the way of a people whose children are starving to death, whose families are dying in hospitals because of preventable diseases and they don't have the medicine for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  CNN's Isa Soares joins us live from Caracas, Venezuela, and Isa, the lack of aid, the lack of medical care has forced many to seek help outside the country.  What have you seen?</p><p>SOARES:  Very much so, and I've been on both sides really.  I've been on the Cucuta side in the Colombia side, but also here now in Venezuela, and the need is dire.  We've heard from Juan Guaido, the self-declared interim President of Venezuela.  He, himself said, Kristie that as many as 350,000 people are at risk of dying if they don't have their medication, and what I've seen on the other side of the border is the most basic needs.  I am talking about gauze.  I am talking about IV fluids to all the way to anti-retroviral to antibiotics.</p><p>[08:35:02]</p><p>SOARES:  I met some of the people who are crossing the border and seeking desperately needed help.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SOARES (voice over):  For most of her young life, Frangeli has only known hunger.  Now, her body is feeling its impact.  Frail, irritable and in pain, she's been unable to keep food down, but her little tummy, suffering from secure acute malnutrition in what was once the world's richest oil nation just can't keep it in.</p><p>She's one of thousands of Venezuelan children leaving home with many being treated at this border city hospital in Cucuta.</p><p>Several floors up, on the maternity ward, I meet several women who, too, have seen scarcity for months on end.</p><p>SOARES (on camera):  (Speaking in foreign language).  What did you eat there?  Very little?  Rations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>SOARES (voice-over):  I go further down the hall.  And on a floor where pain and life go hand in hand, I come face to face with tragedy.</p><p>SOARES (on camera): She's telling me that her baby is -- baby's dead.  No heartbeat, nothing.  No life, she's telling me.  (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>SOARES:  Twenty-nine, six months.  So basically 29 weeks.  So she's -- her baby's died.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over):  This is the toll of the humanitarian crisis Nicolas Maduro denies.  But death and despair are not just contained within these hospital walls.  I travel through old Cucuta and meet others desperate for help.  Nineteen-year-old Clabor Salazar (ph) recently arrived from Caracas.  He made the journey simply for survival.</p><p>CLABOR SALAZAR, REFUGEE (ph) (Through translator):  If I stayed in Venezuela, I was going to die.  I knew I was going to die.  In fact, all my friends with NIV in Venezuela, out of 30, only one is alive.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over):  He says he is HIV-positive and desperately needed antiretroviral drugs, unavailable back home.</p><p>As he gets a check-up, the doctor at the NGO for which Clebor (ph) volunteers for, tells me nine of his HIV patients died in 2018, all Venezuelans.  Clebor (ph) got out just in time.  But getting here has come with sacrifice and the wounds he carries are still fresh.</p><p>I do my best to delicately ask him if he ever had to sell sex to survive.</p><p>SALAZAR (ph) (Through a translator):  Yes, I sold it and I sold it many times.  And I sold it not only because I needed medicine.  I sold it for food, I sold it because I needed many things.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  And Kristie, these are really heart wrenching stories and only three stories there but there are many people that stopped me on Cucuta Bridge on that bridge in Colombia side asking me where can we get medicine?  I've been speaking to a doctor here in Caracas, too, who sent me a whole list of medicines they're actually in desperate need of, only two actually available in Colombia, so it gives you a sense of people's frustrations, but also, their needs, their urgent needs.</p><p>LU STOUT:  And people there are so desperate that Venezuelans are doing whatever it takes to survive.  Now, we know that Juan Guaido, he has pledged that is going to bring the aid in.  If and when that happens, will it help save more lives?</p><p>SOARES:  Well, that's what he's hoping.  We don't know yet exactly where exactly that is going to for, who is actually it is going for, but he knows that as many as 350,000 people at that brink of death of dying, really, if they don't get that medication.  The fear, of course, is, Kristie that one, he doesn't know for sure that the aid is going to come in and, two, if it does come in, whether Maduro's forces will take the aid from them and then distribute it amongst themselves.</p><p>So there's the real risk that by creating this human chain that these people could be stopped by any one, any of the forces on their way in from Colombia.  He has a huge task ahead of him, and although he has the support, it's not clear yet where the rank and file will let the wave of people through, but clearly, a lot riding on this, not just for Guaido, but clearly for the hundreds of thousands of people who are in dire need of help -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Absolutely, Isa Soares, in Caracas, Venezuela.  Isa, we thank you so much for your reporting.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  We'll be back right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, the start of a new week here in Hong Kong.  Welcome back, this is \"News Stream.\"  Now, U.S. President Donald Trump says he has discovered collusion and the guilty party is the cast of \"Saturday Night Live.\"  It all started when the show opened with Alec Baldwin as the President predicting how his national emergency declaration on the border wall will turn out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEC BALDWIN PORTRAYING DONALD TRUMP, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE:  I'm basically taking military money, so I can have the wall.  So I am going to sign these papers for emergency and then I'll immediately be sued and the ruling will not go in my favor, and then I will end up in the Supreme Court and then, I'll call my buddy, Kavanaugh and I'll say, \"It's time to re-pay the Donnie,\" and he will say, New phone, who this?\"  And then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my \"house of cards\" and I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory, and my personal hell of playing President will finally be over.</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Okay, so that clearly got under the President's skin.  The next morning, he tweeted this, quote, \"Nothing funny about tired \"Saturday Night Live.\"  How do the networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution.  Very unfair.  It should be looked into.  This is the real collusion.\"  Exclamation point.  Now, as far for Alec Baldwin, he fired back with this, quote, \"Trump whines.

The White House, on the defensive after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fund its border walls. The President also is under pressure because of that interview that Andrew McCabe gave to CBS aired over the weekend. Diplomatic sources are telling us that there are serious discussions between the U.S. and North Korea to begin to exchange diplomats. Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe is refusing to comment on Donald Trump's claim that Mr. Abe nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize last year after his Summit with Kim Jong-un. A new report by the \"Financial Times\" says the United Kingdom believes it can handle any security risks posed by the Chinese telecom giant, Huawei as it builds next generation 5G wireless technology. A Cambridge Analytica employee named Brittany Kaiser has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller is part of the Russia probe into collusion with the Trump campaign. A damning report by a British Parliament Committee is accusing the Facebook founder of contempt saying that Facebook has behaved like a digital gangster that considers itself ahead of and beyond the law. Just days after a horrendous car bomb in Indian- administered Kashmir, there is new violence. The Saudi Crown Prince visits to make major announcements in Pakistan. India has accused Pakistan of being behind the violence, claims that Islamabad denies. Haiti's government is calling on residents to return to normal activities today. U.S. President Trump is expected to mention the Venezuela crisis during a speech in Miami later on Monday.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KRISTIE LU STOUT, HOST, \"NEWS STREAM\" (voice over): The pressure mounts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is going to protect his national emergency declaration guaranteed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LU STOUT (voice over): The White House defends Donald Trump's push for the border wall amid growing political and legal hurdles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADAM SCHIFF, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: He is pretty much daring the courts to strike this down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): As new details emerge about how the Russia investigation started.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR, FBI: I believe I was fired because I opened a case against the President of the United States.</p><p>MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SENATOR, TEXAS, REPUBLICAN: What is happening in Venezuela is a man-made crisis of epic proportion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): A push for relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The aid will get through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: But for some, it may be too little too late.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: What did you eat there?

U.K. lawmakers say the company intentionally violated data privacy and competition laws.</p><p>Vidd2</p><p>LU STOUT (on camera): I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, and welcome to \"News Stream.\" We'll have those stories in a moment, but first more evidence this hour of the raging conflicts that Brexit is causing in Britain's Parliament, seven members of the opposition, Labour Party have abruptly resigned saying that they have no confidence in the party's collective leadership confidence or culture as anti-Semitism scandal has also contributed to these defections.</p><p>Let's go straight now to CNN's Phil Black. He joins us from London, and Phil, what more did these seven say about why they're quitting the Labour Party.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Kristie, Brexit looms over this as it does every aspect of British politics at the moment, but the problems within the Labour Party are deeper and wider than just that one enormous issue, and so that is why people have been speculating about a possible split within the party for some time.</p><p>But there is no doubt on this occasion, Brexit policy is key. The seven resigning MPs are all passionately in favor of another referendum on the issue and is an idea the Labour Party leadership has not embraced. These seven are also upset and angry at the Party's efforts or lack of them when it comes to dealing with anti-Semitism among the Labour Party leadership and more broadly, these are people who are concerned with the ideological gulf that opened up really with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn at the leadership of the Party ever since he has steered the Party quite dramatically to the left.</p><p>So all of these things were discussed and explained by these resigning MPs as they explain to people why they are now leaving a party they were once very much dedicated to. Take a listen to some of their comments from today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS LESLIE, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP: British politics is now well and truly broken. The evidence of Labour's betrayal on Europe is now visible for all to see.</p><p>LUCIANA BERGER, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP: I cannot remain in a Party that I have today come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti- Semitic.</p><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, FORMER BRITISH LABOUR MP: The last few years have shown the established parties are simply not up to this challenge. They can't be the change because they have become the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLACK: So, this group is not establishing another party, a new party, not yet anyway, but they are organized. They've got a website. They say they will be sitting in Parliament as the independent group. It is a dramatic day for the British Labour Party, but its impact on wider politics in this country will really depend what happens next and crucially whether or not other MPs join them, not just MPs from the Labour Party, but MPs perhaps from the ruling Conservative Party as well. That's what these seven say they want to happen -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: A dramatic day in British politics. Phil Black reporting live for us. Phil, thank you. And the political dysfunction also playing out in full force on the other side of the Atlantic. The White House, on the defensive after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall.</p><p>In the coming hours, the progressive group, Move On, is sponsoring protests to denounce what they call a dangerous power grab. But President Trump, he is doubling down. A White House adviser suggests he is prepared to issue the first veto of his presidency if Congress votes down his national emergency declaration. Here's what Stephen Miller told Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, FOX NEWS: Will the President veto that, which would be the first veto of his presidency?</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, SENIOR ADVISER TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, obviously, the President is going to protect his national emergency declaration, Chris, and I know that we're out of time, but again, I want to make this point. There is no threat --</p><p>WALLACE: So yes, he will veto?</p><p>MILLER: He is going to protect his national emergency declaration guaranteed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: A move like that would no doubt trigger a contentious drawn-out battle on Capitol Hill. Now, Mr. Trump is already facing legal challenges to the move. California's Attorney General is promising to file a lawsuit imminently.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a new interview, the former acting FBI Director, Andrew McCabe says Mr. Trump's own words about the Russia probe are what landed him under investigation.</p><p>[08:05:07]</p><p>LU STOUT: Shortly after declaring a national emergency, President Trump headed to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and that's where find our Sarah Westwood. Sarah, thank you for joining us. As we heard from Stephen Miller, his former adviser saying that the President's would use his veto power if Congress acts. How does the White House plan to defend against legal action when the courts take action?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN: Well, Kristie, good morning and White House officials say this declaration was prepared with these inevitable legal and congressional challenges in mind.</p><p>They spent weeks putting this together and they are set to face lawsuits from California and at least six other states from the ACLU and other groups challenging the constitutionality of this declaration. That resolution of disapproval is also likely to find some support in the Senate. House Democrats already preparing to move forward with that.</p><p>We already have heard some Republicans make the argument that the national emergency declaration is not a subversion of the will of Congress because Congress did include some funding for a border barrier in the spending package that President Trump signed on Friday and because lawmakers have consistently funded barriers along the southern border over the past few years.</p><p>So this is simply the President adding more funding to something that Congress itself has chosen to appropriate. Critics of the move of course accuse the President of trying to go around the will of Congress which had the opportunity to give the President more funding for his border wall after weeks of negotiations, declined to, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: The President also is under pressure because of that interview that Andrew McCabe gave to CBS aired over the weekend, what more did McCabe, the former acting FBI Director, say about exactly why top officials decided to open that probe into President Trump?</p><p>WESTWOOD: McCabe said there were a few events that FBI agents looked at before opening that counter-intelligence probe. One of them was the President directly tying the Russia investigation to his decision on May 2017 to fire former FBI Director, James Comey; another was the President telling Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting that the firing of Comey had relieved quote, \"great pressure\" on him.</p><p>So that combination of things combined with the President's continuing attacks on the Russia investigation convinced McCabe, according to him, to open that counter-intelligence probe which of course was ultimately folded into the work that Special Counsel, Robert Mueller is been doing once he was appointed.</p><p>There has been some back and forth between the Justice Department and McCabe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saying that he said in jest that he would wear a wire to the White House to record President Trump. McCabe said that was a serious suggestion.</p><p>President Trump has been hitting back on Twitter attacking McCabe highlighting the fact that McCabe was fired from the FBI for failing to be truthful with investigators about a series of leaks. So there has been some back and forth between McCabe and the President as the former acting FBI Director is speaking out -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Sarah Westwood reporting live from Mar-a-Lago, thank you.</p><p>CNN has exclusive details of potential breaks in relations between the U.S. and North Korea, ahead of the second Trump-Kim Summit later month. Our senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski is live in Washington with more and Michelle, what are sources telling you about a possible diplomatic upgrade between the U.S. and North Korea?</p><p>MICHELLE KOSINSKI, SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Hi, Kristie. Well, you know there has been this big question looming just days away from the second Trump-Kim Summit. But what could possibly come out of this? Because so far North Korea has done really nothing significant towards denuclearization and there is so little confidence that they are prepared to do anything any time soon.</p><p>So now, diplomatic sources are telling us that there are serious discussions between the U.S. and North Korea to begin to exchange diplomats, although this would be very preliminary. It would be an exchange of what we call liaison officers. So diplomats on each side, there would be several, they would go to each other's countries and establish an office there called a liaison office and this would be kind of a first step towards any kind of real diplomatic relationship between the two countries. But it would be different, kind of a precursor to establishing real diplomatic ties that you would normally see, say, between two countries that get along.</p><p>This was attempted before back in 1994, when there was another massive working towards denuclearization in North Korea. It got to the point that the U.S. actually leased space in North Korea to establish a liaison office.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>KOSINSKI: North Korea looked at sites in Washington, D.C. for the same, but by the end of the following year, after all of this discussion, North Korea completely pulled the plug on it. So at this point, all we know is that there are serious discussions going on about this. This is a serious consideration. It might even be announced at the upcoming summit in Vietnam.</p><p>However, a big question mark that still hangs over, of course is, is the U.S. requiring anything specific of North Korea towards denuclearization before something like this could happen -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: A possible new deliverable being announced to you through sources ahead of the next Trump-Kim Summit. Michelle Kosinski reporting live for us. Michelle, thank you.</p><p>Now, the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe is refusing to comment on Donald Trump's claim that Mr. Abe nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize last year after his Summit with Kim Jong-un. A Japanese newspaper reported that Mr. Abe did so after the U.S. government informally sought his support. Now, here is what the Prime Minister said in a lower House of Parliament earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHINZO ABE, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (Through a translator): As I said earlier, I am not saying that this is not the fact. If you allow me to repeat, President Trump has been working towards solving North Korea's missile issues decisively. I put a high value on President Trump's leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Not quite an answer there. Now, the White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report.</p><p>A new report by the \"Financial Times\" says the United Kingdom believes it can handle any security risks posed by the Chinese telecom giant, Huawei as it builds next generation 5G wireless that works around the world, but the U.S. government doesn't agree. It has been pushing for Huawei's technology to be banned, alleging that it could be used by China for spying, something that the the company strenuously denies.</p><p>Samuel Burke joins us now from London with more. And Samuel first, what exactly is Britain's National Cybersecurity Center saying about the risks posed by Huawei?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Kristie, it's quite interesting because the Cybersecurity Center is saying that they have unique understanding over Huawei's engineering and security capabilities, so you could interpret that as being, \"Listen, even if somebody or some country wanted to use the Huawei equipment to eavesdrop or manipulate data, we would be able to spot that and fix that.\"</p><p>And I have to tell you that is much more in line from what we've heard from cybersecurity experts, not the cybersecurity experts from governments, but from private cybersecurity experts who say even if there were some type of flaw in the Huawei equipment that allowed them to do something nefarious, governments would be able to find it and fix it.</p><p>So with that in mind, I just want to put on the screen three takeaways from yet another round of Huawei. Number one, we have to remember here what we're hearing from telecom CEOs is very different. One CEO even told me here in the U.K. that he believes that the U.K. is taking orders from the U.S. because of Brexit, because he feels there is so much pressure on the U.K. to get a trade deal with the U.S. that they're taking orders from the U.S. and other European countries as well.</p><p>Number two, in spite of everything happening with Huawei, new numbers show us that Huawei is crushing Apple in China and Huawei says they haven't changed their sights set on replacing Samsung as the number one provider of smartphones in the world by next year.</p><p>And number three, you have to remember that it's not easy to replace Huawei. We hear from so many countries and from so many telecoms companies that taking out Huawei would make it much harder for them to bring 5G by this year and next year, because the other equipment may not be as good and would be much more costly -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Fascinating, so if Huawei is a risk or not a risk or manageable risk, the debate just goes on. Samuel Burke reporting live for us, thank you. Now to the latest controversy involving Facebook.</p><p>A British Parliamentary Committee has just released a report on social media disinformation after revealing internal Facebook e-mails, and this is what they found. The social media platform quote, \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and competition laws.\"</p><p>Now, the e-mail showed that Facebook was quote, \"willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to app developers.\" Now, lawmakers also claim that the document showed that the social network was able to \"starve\" some developers of data and force them out of business.</p><p>Let's bring in Carole Cadwalladr, she is journalist for \"The Guardian\" as well as \"The Observer,\" and she is one of the reporters who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal. She joins us from London. Carole, thank you for joining us here on the program. You call this new U.K. government report a fake news and disinformation a landmark report. Why is that?</p><p>CAROLE CADWALLADR, JOURNALIST, THE GUARDIAN/OBSERVER, U.K.: It's so comprehensive, it looks at this entire landscape of big tech companies, digital campaigning, fake news, Cambridge Analytica and so much more and it is completely damming about Facebook.</p><p>[08:15:10]</p><p>CADWALLADR: It accuses Mark Zuckerberg of holding the Parliament in contempt and of its senior executives actually deliberately setting out to deceive Parliament in seeking answers.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, as you point out, it's a comprehensive report. It's a damning report as well, you know, accusing the Facebook founder of contempt saying that Facebook has behaved like a digital gangster that considers itself ahead of and beyond the law. Were you taken aback or surprised by that strong language?</p><p>CADWALLADR: No, because we have seen over many, many months that the U.K. Parliament and then it was joined by eight other Parliaments from around the world has really tried to hold Facebook to account and to summon Mark Zuckerberg to Britain to answer these questions, and time and time again, Facebook has refused. And I think Parliament just ran out of patience.</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, Facebook has responded to this Parliamentary report. It's U.K. Public Policy Manager said in a statement this that the company quote, \"supports effective privacy legislation\" and is also open to quote, \"meaningful regulation.\" So your thoughts on that response from Facebook and also the big question, will the British government act?</p><p>CADWALLADR: Well, I find that quite an astonishing response from Facebook because many of the laws were actually in place and it deliberately set out to break them. That's what the evidence of the report is saying. We had laws and it broke them.</p><p>So I find that a curious answer from Facebook, and as to whether the British government will respond, that's to be seen, I certainly hope so. One of the things in the report, it has made very clear is that our electoral laws simply don't work in this new age of digital campaigning and it says, they are not fit the purpose.</p><p>And then there's a third aspect of the report, which is very interesting and that is where the report calls out foreign interference in British elections and it calls out the government for being completely silent on this subject and it is calling for an independent investigation into all elections in Britain since 2014. I think that's very significant. I think the government is going to try and want to dodge answering questions on that. I really hope the MPs don't allow it to get away with it.</p><p>LU STOUT: And speaking of foreign interference also on your radar, a Cambridge Analytica employee named Brittany Kaiser has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller is part of the Russia probe into collusion with the Trump campaign. How big is this?</p><p>CADWALLADR: Well, we broke this story yesterday in \"The Observer\" and CNN did a great report on it as well today, and I think it's very significant because it is the -- Kaiser is the second employee of Cambridge Analytica who we know has been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller.</p><p>What's so interesting about her is that she worked on the Trump campaign, but she also worked on the Brexit campaign. And in Britain, we've been really desperately trying to ignore Mueller's inquiry into Trump-Russia collusion, and the fact that so many threads of it seem to go through London. But the case is now becoming un-ignorable, and that's why it does feel very important.</p><p>And again, again, we really need the government to respond to this and tell us that it is taking this Russian interference threat very seriously.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, foreign interference, fake news, disinformation, all the threads coming to a head yet again, with this new report out. Carole Cadwalladr joining us from London. Thank you so much for your reporting and take care.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream\" and still ahead, just days after a horrendous car bomb left scenes like these in Indian-administered Kashmir, there is new violence. We'll get the response from both sides of the border.</p><p>And staying in Pakistan, the Saudi Crown Prince visits to make major announcements, find out what they are, next.</p><p>[08:20:00]</p><p>LU STOUT: There has been new violence at a flash point between two nuclear armed nations -- India and Pakistan. Four Indian troops have been killed in a gunfight with militants in Indian-administered Kashmir. This is days after a car bomb exploded in the same area. India has accused Pakistan of being behind the violence, claims that Islamabad denies. Now for more, let's speak to both Sophia Safi in Islamabad, and Nikhil Kumar in New Delhi. Hello to you both and Nikhil, we'll start with you. India troops were killed in this clash in Kashmir. How did it unfold? Exactly what happened?</p><p>NIKHIL KUMAR, INDIA BUREAU CHIEF, CNN: So, Kristie, Indian authorities tell us that they had intelligence telling them that there was militants hiding out in this area in Indian-administered Kashmir. They sent in troops to investigate, to follow up on that intelligence. As they approached a target house, a house that they had focused on where they thought the militants were hiding, they were met with oncoming gunfire.</p><p>In that gun fight, four Indian troops as you said, and one civilian were fatally injured. Two militants were also killed. Indian authorities are yet to determine which group these militants were affiliated with and they are still combing the area to work out if there are more militants on the loose in that area.</p><p>But of course, this all comes just days after that massive car bomb attack which left 40 Indian troops dead, paramilitaries dead in Indian- administered Kashmir, the worst attack there in several decades on Indian forces which has inflamed tensions on the subcontinent and let to calls in India for action against Pakistan.</p><p>The Indian authorities say that that car bomb attack last week, that Pakistan had quote, \"a direct hand in it.\" Pakistan of course denies this, and those tensions have really inflamed politicians' political rhetoric across the political spectrum. There have been calls from everywhere.</p><p>And so this attack today, four more killed, plays into that tension. It has led to more calls for action against Pakistan, that again, as I say, in this case, India hasn't yet said which group was involved. They're still investigating it -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: So Sophia, Indian authorities, they are accusing Pakistan of being behind this spike of violence in Kashmir, so how is Pakistan responding?</p><p>SOPHIA SAFI, PRODUCER, CNN: Well, Kristie, initially when this event actually took place, when this attack happened, there wasn't really much of a response from Pakistan, which is kind of unusual considering the kind of rhetoric that was coming from across the border.</p><p>Now, in previous situations like this, we have seen very strong comments coming back and forth. There has been a volley almost of insults being hurled across back and forth from border. This time, we saw MOFA release one short statement. Initially, it was just a tweet condemning the incident and saying that if Pakistan was not behind this, there was a longer statement that came out last night calling India's reaction a knee- jerk statement, a knee-jerk reaction, claiming that India is being belligerent and war mongering and what is unusual -- the possibility of this being unusual is because of the timing of this attack.</p><p>This happened right before a landmark visit by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. It happened just the day before. He was due to arrive and it also happened the weekend before there was an Afghan-Taliban delegation due to arrive in Islamabad.</p><p>So diplomatically, this was a very sensitive - this was a very sensitive weekend for the country. Normally, you have the Pakistani military spokesperson consistently and constantly making statements against India whenever even a small incident occurs. So it's been very quiet comparatively on this front.</p><p>[08:25:10]</p><p>SAFI: We are expecting more statements after - you know, today has passed because MBS has just left Pakistan, so it remains to be seen how this does play out, but it is something that is causing massive concerns here amongst analysts in Pakistan -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, with Kashmir emerging as a flash point, yet again. Nikhil Kumar reporting live from New Delhi. Sophia Safi reporting live from Islamabad. Thank you to you both and Sophia stick around. We are going to talk again very, very shortly.</p><p>As Sophia reported just then, the situation in Kashmir is overshadowing a major visit from one of the country's major allies, Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman left Islamabad a short time ago. He spent the day there as part of a tour of Asia that will also include India and China.</p><p>Now, let's go back to Sophia standing by in Islamabad. And Sophia, Pakistan really rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi Crown Prince and has Pakistan been richly rewarded?</p><p>SAFI: Well, you know, there has been a signing of agreements between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which amounted to about $20 billion. Now, this is a massive amount of investment in the country. I spoke to the Chairman of the Board of Investment, and according to him, this is the largest ever investment in recent history in Pakistan by another country.</p><p>Now, apart from that, there's also been an announcement by the Saudi Crown Prince that he is going to be -- that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is going to be releasing over 2,000 Pakistani prisoners languishing in jails across Saudi Arabia, this was a request that was made by Prime Minister Imran Khan at a state banquet on Sunday night.</p><p>So it was very surprising that the decision was made immediately the next morning. It's been welcomed by human rights activists, but again, there is a massive economic crisis in Pakistan. The country is on the brink of another economic bailout from the IMF, so this will actually soften that kind of situation that Pakistan is currently facing.</p><p>Apart from that, what some critics are saying is that this renewal of ties with Saudi Arabia might prove problematic when it comes to Pakistan's relationship with allies in China, in Turkey, in Qatar, as well as in Iran. So generally, a positive vibe here in Pakistan, but you know, he has got another two countries to visit - China and India. So it remains to be seen what developments will come out of that, and how this will play out in the months to come -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Sophia Safi, we thank you for your reporting. You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still ahead, U.S. Senator, Marco Rubio says humanitarian aid to Venezuela will get through with or without the help of President Maduro. We are live in Caracas, next.</p><p>[08:25:08]</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, you're watching \"News Stream.\" And these are your world headlines. Seven members of Britain's Labour Party have abruptly resigned saying that they are embarrassed and ashamed of their Party's handling of Brexit. They also expressed their lack of confidence in Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn and the handling of a growing scandal over anti-Semitism.</p><p>A newly released report by a British lawmakers conclude that Facebook quote \"intentionally and knowingly violated privacy and competition laws.\" It also find its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg showed contempt toward the British Parliament by refusing to testify before them. Facebook denies the accusations.</p><p>Haiti's government is calling on residents to return to normal activities today. Ten days of violence have gripped the country with deadly protests against soaring inflation and allegations of widespread government corruption. Hundreds have gathered to try to stock up on fuel and water, now in scarce supply. It's not even clear how many people have been killed and injured in the unrest in Haiti. Many cannot get to treatment and hospitals are overwhelmed.</p><p>Let's go straight to Sam Kiley. He has been reporting in Port-Au-Prince. He joins us now live, and Sam, the government is calling for this return to normal, but what's the situation today there in Haiti?</p><p>SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, there hasn't been a mass return to normal, Kristie nor has been a return to the sort of riots that cursed this country for the previous nine days. Yesterday, the opposition tried to get some demonstrations off the ground, but they -- if you'll excuse the pundit, fully catch fire.</p><p>This morning though, we are getting a slightly mysterious story coming from government authorities alleging that five Americans among a small group of seven or eight other foreign nationals have been arrested in possession of weapons and accused of criminal conspiracy. They haven't yet been charged. We don't know what the charges are. There is not yet any kind of suggestion directly from the government of some kind of political activity, but that is certainly serving as a distraction for Haitians from the day- to-day realities here which is a very, very tough life.</p><p>Indeed, in the last 48 hours, people have been stocking up on cooking gas, on gasoline for their cars, on water which is extremely short supply here in the capital, Port-Au-Prince, Kristie, but that is following nine days really when an awful lot of people, most people indeed, were unable to leave their homes amid this paroxysm of violence that was a result of an explosion of anger marking the anniversary of the second year of the President coming to office.</p><p>Now, of course, they're demanding he step down. The Prime Minister stepped in a couple of days ago saying that there would be the launch of a commission to investigate corruption and to name names in that process. That may have drawn the sting for now. But Haitians remain extremely angry and extremely frustrated with their government -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Too early to call a return to calm there in Haiti. Sam Kiley reporting live for us. Sam, thank you.</p><p>Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido is setting up a showdown with his political rival over the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid. He is calling on a million volunteers to help to bring supplies into the country by Saturday. The aid has been piling up in neighboring Columbia because sitting President Nicolas Maduro has refused to let it in.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is expected to mention the Venezuela crisis during a speech in Miami later on Monday. On Sunday, U.S. Republican Senator, Marco Rubio had this message for President Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUBIO: Well, the aid is going to get through, and I think ultimately, the question is whether it gets through in a way that he is cooperative with or in a way that he is not. But there is no way you're going to stand ultimately in the way of a people whose children are starving to death, whose families are dying in hospitals because of preventable diseases and they don't have the medicine for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: CNN's Isa Soares joins us live from Caracas, Venezuela, and Isa, the lack of aid, the lack of medical care has forced many to seek help outside the country. What have you seen?</p><p>SOARES: Very much so, and I've been on both sides really. I've been on the Cucuta side in the Colombia side, but also here now in Venezuela, and the need is dire. We've heard from Juan Guaido, the self-declared interim President of Venezuela. He, himself said, Kristie that as many as 350,000 people are at risk of dying if they don't have their medication, and what I've seen on the other side of the border is the most basic needs. I am talking about gauze. I am talking about IV fluids to all the way to anti- retroviral to antibiotics.</p><p>[08:35:02]</p><p>SOARES: I met some of the people who are crossing the border and seeking desperately needed help. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SOARES (voice over): For most of her young life, Frangeli has only known hunger. Now, her body is feeling its impact. Frail, irritable and in pain, she's been unable to keep food down, but her little tummy, suffering from secure acute malnutrition in what was once the world's richest oil nation just can't keep it in.</p><p>She's one of thousands of Venezuelan children leaving home with many being treated at this border city hospital in Cucuta.</p><p>Several floors up, on the maternity ward, I meet several women who, too, have seen scarcity for months on end.</p><p>SOARES (on camera): (Speaking in foreign language). What did you eat there? Very little? Rations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): I go further down the hall. And on a floor where pain and life go hand in hand, I come face to face with tragedy.</p><p>SOARES (on camera): She's telling me that her baby is -- baby's dead. No heartbeat, nothing. No life, she's telling me. (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Speaking in foreign language).</p><p>SOARES: Twenty-nine, six months. So basically 29 weeks. So she's -- her baby's died.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): This is the toll of the humanitarian crisis Nicolas Maduro denies. But death and despair are not just contained within these hospital walls. I travel through old Cucuta and meet others desperate for help. Nineteen-year-old Clabor Salazar (ph) recently arrived from Caracas. He made the journey simply for survival.</p><p>CLABOR SALAZAR, REFUGEE (ph) (Through translator): If I stayed in Venezuela, I was going to die. I knew I was going to die. In fact, all my friends with NIV in Venezuela, out of 30, only one is alive.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): He says he is HIV-positive and desperately needed antiretroviral drugs, unavailable back home.</p><p>As he gets a check-up, the doctor at the NGO for which Clebor (ph) volunteers for, tells me nine of his HIV patients died in 2018, all Venezuelans. Clebor (ph) got out just in time. But getting here has come with sacrifice and the wounds he carries are still fresh.</p><p>I do my best to delicately ask him if he ever had to sell sex to survive.</p><p>SALAZAR (ph) (Through a translator): Yes, I sold it and I sold it many times. And I sold it not only because I needed medicine. I sold it for food, I sold it because I needed many things.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SOARES: And Kristie, these are really heart wrenching stories and only three stories there but there are many people that stopped me on Cucuta Bridge on that bridge in Colombia side asking me where can we get medicine? I've been speaking to a doctor here in Caracas, too, who sent me a whole list of medicines they're actually in desperate need of, only two actually available in Colombia, so it gives you a sense of people's frustrations, but also, their needs, their urgent needs.</p><p>LU STOUT: And people there are so desperate that Venezuelans are doing whatever it takes to survive. Now, we know that Juan Guaido, he has pledged that is going to bring the aid in. If and when that happens, will it help save more lives?</p><p>SOARES: Well, that's what he's hoping. We don't know yet exactly where exactly that is going to for, who is actually it is going for, but he knows that as many as 350,000 people at that brink of death of dying, really, if they don't get that medication. The fear, of course, is, Kristie that one, he doesn't know for sure that the aid is going to come in and, two, if it does come in, whether Maduro's forces will take the aid from them and then distribute it amongst themselves.</p><p>So there's the real risk that by creating this human chain that these people could be stopped by any one, any of the forces on their way in from Colombia. He has a huge task ahead of him, and although he has the support, it's not clear yet where the rank and file will let the wave of people through, but clearly, a lot riding on this, not just for Guaido, but clearly for the hundreds of thousands of people who are in dire need of help -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Absolutely, Isa Soares, in Caracas, Venezuela. Isa, we thank you so much for your reporting. You're watching \"News Stream.\" We'll be back right after this.</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, the start of a new week here in Hong Kong. Welcome back, this is \"News Stream.\" Now, U.S. President Donald Trump says he has discovered collusion and the guilty party is the cast of \"Saturday Night Live.\" It all started when the show opened with Alec Baldwin as the President predicting how his national emergency declaration on the border wall will turn out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEC BALDWIN PORTRAYING DONALD TRUMP, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE: I'm basically taking military money, so I can have the wall. So I am going to sign these papers for emergency and then I'll immediately be sued and the ruling will not go in my favor, and then I will end up in the Supreme Court and then, I'll call my buddy, Kavanaugh and I'll say, \"It's time to re-pay the Donnie,\" and he will say, New phone, who this?\" And then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my \"house of cards\" and I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory, and my personal hell of playing President will finally be over.</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Okay, so that clearly got under the President's skin. The next morning, he tweeted this, quote, \"Nothing funny about tired \"Saturday Night Live.\" How do the networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution. Very unfair. It should be looked into. This is the real collusion.\" Exclamation point. Now, as far for Alec Baldwin, he fired back with this, quote, \"Trump whines.

The <person><nameText>Obama administration, </nameText></person>for example, recently came out in support of a ban on non-compete agreements[1] for certain industries and employers. Before that, the President has been vocal in his support for paid sick leave[2]. As a man in the twilight of his presidency, Obama is taking a firm stand on issues he previously remained quiet on. </p><p>It's a common tactic for politicians on their way out the door. But the President and his team aren't stopping there. For an administration that presided over the worst economic disaster in modern history, and managed to successfully get things turned around (though there are still issues, to be sure), Obama knows that Americans are still hurting. As a part of his final act, his team is releasing a brand-new tool for American workers who feel they're being screwed by employers. It's a new government website: worker.gov[3]. The idea was to create a website that can be used as a resource to workers who feel that they've been stiffed or screwed, and who are unfamiliar with their rights or labor laws. People have all sorts of issues at work\u00a0and often can feel apprehensive about asking or exercising their rights for fear of retaliation. Worker.gov's goal is to help those folks out. Worker.gov: A Useful tool?Job applicants line up for interviews | Mario Tama/Getty Images 'We're removing the guesswork, and providing workers access to critical information about their rights under the major labor statutes in a way that makes sense for them,' wrote\u00a0Sharon Block of U.S. Department of Labor in a press release[4]. 'Worker.gov recognizes the simple truth that people do not think about having an 'FLSA' or 'FMLA' or 'Title VII' problem. They just know that they have an unfairness-on-the-job problem.' The statement continued: 'Worker.gov reflects what we learned from listening to workers about what information they need and how they want to receive it.' The question, however, is whether the site is actually useful. We don't quite know yet \u2014 it's still in beta phase. The idea is that it will evolve and grow more useful with time. 'The most important innovation is that we'll constantly be collecting feedback and improving the site. In other words, the more workers use worker.gov, the better it becomes,' Block said. So, at this point, we don't know how big of an impact the site will have. It isn't difficult to see the demand for it; almost everyone has had a question regarding the rules and regulations governing their workplace. This should make it easier to navigate those laws. Labor laws and workers' rightsWorkers' rights activists protest for tougher labor laws | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Again, this is yet another bone the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is tossing to the country's workers. Along with worker.gov and his support for paid sick leave and non-compete bans, he's also issued executive orders relating to the minimum wage for government contractors and overtime rules for salaried workers. Though a good portion of the electorate still dislikes him, the President has really gone out of his way to stick up for the working public. Of course, his opponents in Congress and in the media have lobbied hard for the repeal of several of these actions. Opponents argue that he's overstepped his authority with the\u00a0use of executive orders. Others simply don't like the uptick in rules and regulations. But it seems that overall, things are getting better for the working class. Along with state legislation (like minimum wage increases), Obama's presidency has seen the fastest increase in household incomes in decades[5]. We can't credit the President for that completely. But it's hard to deny that things have improved. And now, worker.gov is up and running. Potentially, it's a valuable new tool in the hands of workers.

In an extract from his new book, Peter Lewis reveals Thornley's fears that the virtual world he helped create has become a toxic wasteland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1991, armed with degrees in commerce and law, Evan Thornley talked himself into a job at the business consultancy McKinsey. He was durable enough to manoeuvre his way into the firm's New York media practice, where his job was to manage the Reader's Digest account, the publishing empire whose business model revolved round providing a wholesome grab-bag of articles, anecdotes and compressed works of literature for time-poor readers. A 'best on the web' before there was a web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thornley arrived in New York with a simple idea: in a world that had moved from information scarcity to information abundance, the ability to order that information was the most powerful tool you could offer anyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was playing with these concepts the night he discovered Netscape, one of the first browsers that allowed users to navigate the web without needing to enter computer code.</p><p>\"I had been doing online stuff working on systems like Unix and Delphi and it was hard as buggery,\" he remembers, \"then a workmate at McKinsey fires up the browser and five seconds later he's looking for apartments to rent in London. And I thought to myself, 'Oh my God - this going to change the world!\"'</p><p>Over the following decade, Thornley went on to change the world by pioneering search-engine technology through the company he co-founded with his wife Tracy Ellery in 1995, LookSmart.</p><p>But ever since he cashed in his shares and returned home from the US to Australia, Thornley has spent his days pondering how the world can get itself out of the digitalised knot it has spun itself into - one he inadvertently helped to create.</p><p>Thornley's villain is not network technology: it is the individualism that has both shaped and been shaped by it, and led more and more people to feel alone and unhappy in a consumer-oriented world where every impulse is calculated to make us less connected to those closest to us, rather than more so.</p><p>Back in the early '90s, the gap that Thornley identified was in sifting and categorising all the pages that were flooding the web. There were already a few fledging search engines on the market like Yahoo! but they were basic sorters of files.</p><p>His idea was more ambitious, to create what he called a 'hierarchical ontology' of categories, a bit like the way libraries used to sort books. There would be a broad category like music, then a more specific category like country music, then something even more specific like Mary Chapin Carpenter. The trick was to get to that point fast.</p><p>Thornley's plan was to hire a team of human editors whose job each day would be to seek out, rate and categorise websites into curated lists. As more and more sites were built every day, a service to sort out the quality from the rest was timely. But it was just the tip of the business model.</p><p>While other search engines like AltaVista, Infoseek and Excite were setting themselves up as entry points to assist a user to navigate the web, Thornley recognised there could be something different. If someone was searching for something, then it was obvious they were more likely to be a buyer than someone who wasn't searching for anything. Search to him was more than a navigation system; it was the 'big front door' to deliver really high-quality leads for anyone wanting to do business on the fledgling web.</p><p>He took his idea to Reader's Digest. While the magazine still defined the brand, it had become a very different business. The real money now was in direct sales to subscribers. The magazine was the big front door into direct sales of books, CDs and videos. The company was so good at direct mail that it could send out a test offer to see if someone would buy a book, record or video before they produced it. It could estimate to within 500 copies what they were going to sell. Reader's Digest didn't make a product unless they knew they were going to sell a million copies.</p><p>Thornley's message to Reader's Digest in 1995 was simple: the company had a great business model and was getting better and better at identifying and directly targeting its core customers, but there was a problem: the readership was ageing and not being replaced by younger readers. Worse, he argued, the more they created products that appealed to that core customer base, the more they excluded anyone else.</p><p>Readers Digest said, \"Yeah, but every year we make more money so we don't care.\" And so Thornley produced a single graph based on US mortality rates. It was headed \"10 years from now, customers representing 41 per cent of your profit will be dead\".</p><p>That's when Thornley made his pitch: there's this new thing called the internet and your big front door is going to be search engines. While people think you are helping them find the site they want, what they are actually doing is telling you what they want. So if you capture this information you will be able to bring people to a place where you can offer them something you already know they want. Then he offered the kicker: \"I'm going to do it anyway but if you want to do it with me, I will help you save your business.\"</p><p>Forty-five minutes later he walked out with a cheque for $US10 million.</p><p>While cobbling together the deal that would create LookSmart, Thornley was at the centre of the online universe. He moved to Silicon Valley on the outskirts of San Francisco, the geographical centre of the commercialisation of the web where start-ups tapped into the groundbreaking work of computer scientists at nearby Stanford University.</p><p>Like every new medium and every new technological advance - automobiles, aeroplanes, telephones - it prompted a mad rush of companies trying to find a way to harness digital advances and make a windfall. Like those earlier rushes to exploit technology, this one was driven by a libertarian mindset that government should just get out of the way and let the free market rip. This was totally consistent with the reward-driven speculation at the heart of capitalist enterprise; most go broke, but a few end up huge.</p><p>Thornley's LookSmart embraced the Silicon Valley ethos, but also differentiated itself from an industry where 40 per cent of the revenue was coming from the distribution of online pornography. LookSmart simply did not categorise so-called 'adult' content. It was a simple moral decision for Thornley, but it also became part of the LookSmart brand.</p><p>That principled stand led to the biggest deal of his life. The moment that made LookSmart was the moment Microsoft decided to take the best search engine it could find for its home computers. After trying to take the model and copy it themselves, Microsoft licensed LookSmart to power its PC searches, complete with their Hotmail accounts, helping millions of families navigate their first-ever web experience. By providing a clean search engine, LookSmart was the family-friendly default.</p><p>Reader's Digest walked away from its investment in 1997 after new management decided the internet was just a passing fad. At the time LookSmart had been valued at just $US3 million. By August 1999, when the company floated on the NASDAQ, its valuation was $US1.2 billion. In March 2000 its value was $US7.2 billion, which at that time was the equivalent of $14 billion.</p><p>Owning 15 per cent of the company made Thornley, on paper at least, a billionaire. \"It was surreal,\" he remembers, \"like living in the wealthiest insane asylum on earth.\" There was money sloshing around in the streets and every kid thought they should be a senior vice president with three per cent stock in whatever company they were working for. But Thornley was also aware that these crazy times were never going to last.</p><p>In the dotcom crash of March 2000 nearly every internet company lost 99 per cent of its value. Fortunes disappeared overnight, even if they had never been real fortunes anyway. Because of the earn-out provisions of most floated companies, no-one got the chance to cash in other than the lawyers and business consultants who had orchestrated the bubble - they still made their own fortunes in fees. When the market hit its nadir, LookSmart bottomed out at $US30 million.</p><p>\"The truth is the great companies - and we weren't a great company but we weren't crap - were not overvalued,\" Thornley says. \"It turns out if you bought the great companies like Amazon and eBay at the top of the market before the crash, five years later you still would have made a good investment. But when the tide goes out, all the crap got washed out, including the other search engines like Excite, AltaVista, who all vanished.\"</p><p>In contrast, LookSmart managed to survive and got back to being a more modest and appropriately scaled business, worth hundreds of millions which, for a six-year-old business run by a guy in his early 30s, was still pretty good work.</p><p>Even without the tech crash, LookSmart's days were numbered. Thornley's 'capture, qualify and stream' was the right long-term model to make the web pay but the entry point was the quality of the search. When Google came along with a way of searching the internet that was so much better than anyone had ever imagined, search became a whole new ball game.</p><p>All previous keyword search engines, including LookSmart, had used what are called matching algorithms. The more frequent and close together in the document a set of keywords, the closer to the top of the list of results the site would sit. While the result would give you something relevant, it would not necessarily give you something useful.</p><p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin, a couple of PhDs from Stanford, came up with a new approach. They knew that in academia the currency of a paper was the number of scholars who had cited it. If you write an important research paper that gets cited by 1000 other scholars then you have written the definitive paper. They figured that if citations determined the quality of everything from a PhD to a Nobel Prize, then it was also likely to be the best way to judge a page on the web as well.</p><p>On the web, hyperlink shortcuts took the place of an academic citation. Page and Brin concluded that the more people link to a document, the more useful that document would be, particularly if those other documents that were linking to it were also deemed to be important. With this insight they created an equation that could tell what the online community determined were the most important documents on any given topic and they named it after an extremely large number (one with 100 zeroes after it): a googol.</p><p>Despite being five years late to the web, the Google ranking algorithm blew every other search engine away. All of a sudden the web seemed a whole lot more relevant. Thornley saw Google coming in the rearview mirror and tried to buy it out, but Page and Brin rejected his offer, a shrewd decision on their part. Backed by not one but two of the world's top venture capital firms who had never done a joint deal before, they went it alone and emerged from the ashes of the dotcom crash to win the internet search wars.</p><p>Two decades on, Google has flattened the information hierarchy so that anyone, anywhere can get anything they want, and that's a good thing. But it's also allowed bad people who want to do horrible things to get the information they need and to find others like them - child porn networks, terrorists, drug dealers, the whole dark web. With no ground rules, the web is libertine in the purest sense of the word. It's a tool for good or evil depending on whether you are good or evil.</p><p>More profoundly, Google has realised that every search is a minuscule piece of evidence of human behaviour. Every connection is a living snapshot of human logic, each landing point a manifestation of human desire. Over time Google has learned to track the journeys of its users to create a larger truth, that what we seek defines who we are. It has learned to track our failings too, from simple things like predicting a misspelt word and correcting it for us to understanding the triggers for our grander follies.</p><p>As that body of evidence has grown, so has Google's capacity to understand our behaviour and purport to pre-empt our preferences. Google's ambitions transcended search long ago; its enterprises now range from creating self-driving cars to prototyping the human brain. All this is still anchored in its elegant search algorithm.</p><p>In this environment the dominant platforms like Google and Facebook operate as extreme examples of companies that have accumulated market dominance. They use their scale to entrench their power, managing competition to their advantage.</p><p>Smaller players creating new things will never get to compete because they will be bought up and absorbed before they become a risk. Natural network effects always have a tendency towards monopoly, but the information networks have perfected it and amplified it more than most.</p><p>The companies that thrive master the network effect by creating a model that builds a self-perpetuating supply of users. Every user on Facebook makes the social network more attractive, every search on Google makes its base stronger, every supplier on Amazon makes its marketplace more compelling.</p><p>Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that Big Tech has crushed the theory of 'beneficial competition', the idea that the marketplace will work to distribute goods and services in a way that maximises wellbeing across society.</p><p>This article of faith, that consumers are sovereign and prices are set by their rational decisions, drove economic policy for more than a century. But Stiglitz warns the power has shifted with monopoly technology companies being able to shape consumer desire to extract the maximum price. \"The law of the single price, which is a basic law of efficient markets, is no longer true,\" he told The Australian Financial Review in November 2018. \"That destroys the efficiency of the market economy. It is very serious.\"</p><p>Compounding this fracture is the ability of Big Tech to oppose measures that might change its behaviour and mediate its natural inclinations. Like every other 'Big' industry - Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Coal - it has teams of lobbyists and lawyers to push back at any notion of regulation, wowing decision-makers not just with political donations and cultural cool, but the potential to dish the dirt on critics as well.</p><p>Censorship is a cause c&amp;#xE9;l&amp;#xE8;bre of Big Tech, with CEOs like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg pushing back against any move to regulate online content by invoking the rights of the individual user even as personal privacy becomes a tradable commodity. In this way Big Tech has the resources not just to define the problems but to dictate their solutions to policymakers.</p><p>And here's the rub. While the information hierarchies may have flattened, the economic hierarchy is stronger than it ever was. The institutional edifices that dominated industrial society may have come crashing to the ground, but Big Tech has reconfigured into horizontal structures that are metastasising across the network and exercising the same, if not greater, levels of control. Whether it's the media, real estate, motor sales, employment services - industries that used to use the media have been absorbed and then usurped by the Big Tech companies.</p><p>Could there have been a different way? What if smart people like Thornley, driven by the public good, had set about creating the public infrastructure of the future, rather than what have become private networks on which we all pay to play. Would we have a different network today if the internet had remained a government enterprise? What if the roll-out had been driven by the public interest rather than driven by commercial outcomes?</p><p>\"What makes you think the government wouldn't have stuffed it right up?\" says Thornley. \"It would have been slower, costlier, it would have created a drab and dull set of share files. It would have simply replaced the tendency for private control with state control. And history shows us how that can end.\"</p><p>Thornley's alternate reality does not see the state in the driver's seat but rather people tapping into the spirit of mutualism, the mass movement of cooperatives that were one of the biggest social forces of the early 20th century. Then more than half the households in the English-speaking world were members of mutual organisations of some description. Manchester Unity was a global empire, so too Alcoholics Anonymous, the motoring associations, mutual insurance companies like AMP (before they were privatised and became the worst of the for-profit financial services industry).</p><p>If you want a vision of a more genuinely connected net, conjure up the idea of cooperative platforms that genuinely share. Ask yourself why Airbnb isn't owned by its members. Why don't the drivers and passengers own Uber? Surely in the sharing economy we should share the ownership among all the producers and consumers on the network and not just defer to the landlords who have laid down the pipes?</p><p>For Thornley, face-to-face human relations are the glue, he believes, not these virtual networks that Big Tech has built. It's not just that these new networks are failing to build real connections, they are actually destroying them.</p><p>\"The Enlightenment gave us the gift of scientific method and the fraud of individualism - not individuality, which is fine, but individualism, which is a fraud.\"</p><p>Thornley lines up scientific method, which has largely done humanity good, against this \"fraud of individualism\" that he believes is leading us further and further from the basic truth that \"our lives are going to be better or worse on the basis of how well we relate with those closest to us\".</p><p>He says, \"We were not born as sovereign selves who grew up in splendid isolation any more than we are pieces of data on a spreadsheet. We are formed by those closest to us and we exist socially for the remainder of our days.</p><p>\"The empirical evidence illustrates if those close and intimate relationships are good then life expectancy is longer, health is better, we are economically better off. But if those relationships are threadbare or non-existent then life is precarious and with little margin for error. And if those relationships are toxic then life is pretty awful.\"</p><p>That is something not even on the radar of the people who are inventing the future with their compelling start-ups and sense of technical and economic inevitability. Instead they have bought the dream that you can create any reality if only enough people are prepared to click. That's the web dream, but to Thornley it's nothing more than a virtual reality.</p><p>\"Reality is real people in real relationships with each other with real mutual care,\" he insists, \"and the more we separate ourselves from that central truth the further we are from reality.\"W</p><p>Edited extract from Webtopia: The World Wide Wreck of Tech and How to Make the Net Work by Peter Lewis (NewSouth Publishing).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78ojlqbtscw18ezkoia6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-71J1-F0J6-J4WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Masayoshi Son, the Japanese entrepreneur behind SoftBank, wants his company <url normalizedValue=\"https://group.softbank/en/philosophy/vision\"> to last that long</url>, a goal that is meant to underpin the investments made by his $100bn Vision Fund. So the unmasking of SoftBank as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2\"> the mystery \u201cwhale\u201d</url> whose options trading appears to have helped drive US technology stocks to record highs is a surprise \u2014 this type of trading appears at odds with the self-professed strategic nature of SoftBank\u2019s investments. The revelation has, rightly, fuelled concerns that far from acting like a visionary technology investor, the group is behaving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eec59a3-cb51-487c-aacd-68a0c7e46f2f\"> like a hedge fund</url>.\u00a0</p><p>Whatever the exact details of SoftBank\u2019s equity derivatives trade, the key question is whether the wider market cares. The answer is yes. Aside from the general curiosity \u2014 and sometimes mockery \u2014 that SoftBank attracts in the industry, investors and regulators should be alert to the consequences of one large, determined investor being able \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to influence the world\u2019s largest, most liquid and most scrutinised stock market.\u00a0</p><p>Even before the identification of SoftBank, there were concerns that the US market was defying fundamentals, and that the one-sided rally in US technology stocks was unsustainable. Trading volumes on Nasdaq, where most of the big tech stocks are listed, are double what they were before the pandemic. Monetary stimulus by central banks in response to the pandemic have helped to propel equity markets higher. The retail trading boom, as day traders have turned to online trading platforms such as Robinhood, has also driven much of the activity, both in equities and derivatives.\u00a0</p><p>This surge of activity in the options markets is what makes some investors nervous. Financial institutions, advisers and regulators should be alert to the dangers of unsophisticated investors putting their money \u2014 or, even worse, borrowed money \u2014 to invest in higher-risk trades such as derivatives. In the event of a downturn, there is a possibility that some investors will lose their shirts, leading to real economic pain just as the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic bites.</p><p>In the case of SoftBank, its heavy bet on derivatives has done little to damp fears that the group has lost its strategic focus \u2014 even if it had already announced it would be setting up an asset management unit for public investments. It bears remembering that Japan\u2019s corporate history is peppered with examples of companies and retail investors betting heavily on derivatives and getting burnt.</p><p>Many companies\u2019 problems also often start when they have an excess of funds to deploy; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94dfc17c-4bf8-11df-a217-00144feab49a\"> the ill-fated foray of Germany\u2019s Landesbanken into US subprime mortgages </url>was triggered, in part, by a search for ways to invest a cash surplus. In the case of SoftBank, its recent tech investments were partly funded by cash from its $41bn asset disposal programme.</p><p>Some investors are already fearful of a market crash. Coronavirus looked like it had decisively ended the American equity market\u2019s record bull run; its Lazarus-like revival in the past few months has only heightened the air of unreality. Previous market tumbles have normally had a tipping point, however small relative to the correction that followed. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff27c404-b5ef-4589-a19f-58c8883cd61f\"> recent drop</url> in the valuations of tech stocks may have been enough to take some of the heat out of the market for now but a concern must be that SoftBank could be the snowflake that starts the avalanche.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

That was over a decade ago. Today they have made names for themselves as entrepreneurs in cryptocurrency with a company called Gemini. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Facebook was a dispute, but it didn't really define who we were as people,\" Tyler Winklevoss told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview for the Boss Files podcast. \"Gemini's much more of a representation of who we are, what we stand for, what we're interested in.\" </p><p>But it was hard to ignore their history with Zuckerberg when Facebook announced plans to enter the world of crypto with Libra, a digital coin that just so happens to also be named after a zodiac sign. So, are Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins at it again? </p><p>The brothers don't see it that way. In fact, they're looking to potentially partner with Facebook on Libra. Whether or not they do decide to team up with their old rival, the Winklevoss brothers say Libra is a good thing for the industry and a step toward a time when cryptocurrency is ubiquitous. </p><p>\"I think there is a day in the future where we can't live without crypto, or imagine a world before crypto,\" Cameron Winklevoss said. </p><p>The brothers bought into that vision in the early days of bitcoin, when it was worth around $8, after cashing out much of the wealth they'd earned in Facebook stock from their settlement with Zuckerberg. The value of bitcoin peaked at $20,000 in 2017, and now hovers around $10,000. </p><p>It was a bold bet to make on an investment opportunity the brothers first learned about from a guy on an Ibiza beach after \"some tequila.\" But it paid off for the Winklevoss twins, making them, at least for a time, \"bitcoin billionaires.\" (That also happens to be the title of the book about their lives.)</p><p>With those returns, the brothers started Gemini in 2014. </p><p>Gemini allows people to buy, trade and store digital assets --- or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies have traditionally been decentralized and largely unregulated. The Winklevoss brothers pitched Gemini as a platform people could trust. So they sought and received licenses in New York state as a so-called trust company, similar to many traditional financial institutions, and as a virtual currency exchange. </p><p>\"We often say trust is our product,\" Cameron Winklevoss said. \"And we're trying to basically build a safe and easy way for that person in the Midwest, if they want to buy a piece of crypto, to do it, just like they do at their brokerage account, just like a share of Apple or a share of Amazon.\"</p><p>Gemini is now available in 49 states and Washington, DC, as well as in the United Kingdom, Singapore and several other countries, and it's seeking regulatory approval in other areas around the world. While the company does not publicly share user numbers or revenue, its staff has grown to more than 200 people working out of offices in New York, Portland and Chicago. </p><p>Gemini's desire to work with regulators positions the company well amid ramped up calls by US lawmakers for increased oversight of cryptocurrency. It could also make the Winklevoss brothers a valuable partner for Libra. The push for new regulations has been driven largely by the Libra announcement. Legislators fear Libra could give Facebook too much power, and a rapid buy-in to cryptocurrency driven by the social network's massive audience could destabilize government-backed fiat currencies, like the US dollar. </p><p>The Winklevoss brothers said they've been in talks with Facebook about joining the project's governing body, the Libra Association. Facebook already announced the 28 \"founding members\" of the association, including Gemini competitor Coinbase, but has said it hopes to have 100 members by Libra's launch in early 2020. </p><p>The brothers said they're waiting to learn more about the project before deciding whether to join the association or to list Libra on the Gemini exchange, which they said is another possibility. The Libra Association told CNN Business that it does not comment on ongoing conversations with potential members.</p><p>Ultimately, the twins don't think Facebook will be the last big tech company to try to launch a cryptocurrency. Cameron Winklevoss expects every one of the FAANG companies --- Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google --- to get into crypto.</p><p>\"I think that internet companies have to have a crypto strategy, and I think a lot of them are thinking about their own coin projects. They're probably watching Libra and Facebook to see how that fares as they develop it,\" Cameron Winklevoss said.</p><p>One company well-suited for such a coin, he said, is Amazon. </p><p>\"Amazon can probably get packages to literally any place in the world, even if the last mile is on a dirt bike or something,\" Cameron Winklevoss said. \"What you can't get is paid for those goods, which is very ironic, that the physical stuff we can move all around the world and we can't get money to a lot of places around the world.\"</p><p>That's just one of the ways the brothers expect cryptocurrency to change the world, and they say there's more to come. </p><p>\"We're in the bottom of the first inning,\" Tyler Winklevoss said. \"The game really hasn't started.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

On this side the congresspeople, on their own turf and playing by their own rules. On the other the \"witnesses\", unhappy in the unaccustomed role of being called to account.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Messrs Bezos, Cook, Pichai and Zuckerberg, 29 July was not a good day. But the legislators went home happy.</p><p>                     Background: The hue and cry has been rising in recent years that big tech is too big, too powerful, and engages in monopolist behavior. Thus this hearing.</p><p>America has never been more politically divided in my lifetime, and yet the committee showed bipartisan energy in dragging the CEOs over virtual coals. Democrats are of course in a comfort zone with their fangs in the flesh of an abusive corporation. As for Republicans, there are old-schoolers who really believe all that stuff about free markets and thus are instinctively anti-monopoly. Then there are the Trumpkins who hate big tech because its denizens are fact-driven and literate and thus loathe everything about the current administration. Oh, and Bezos owns the Washington Post, which is very disrespectful indeed.</p><p>                     What the congresspeople wanted:  To utter memorable soundbites highlighting the perfidy and iniquity of the witnesses' organizations, for use in rallying political support. The session was billed as an \"Examination\" but it wasn't, congressional staff had already generated millions of pages of damning evidence. Thus the dialogue was mostly of the form: \"Here is testimony that you did this awful thing. Did you do this awful thing?\" (CEO starts stammering.) \"Sorry, my time is short. Here is testimony that you did this other awful thing. Did you do that awful thing?\"</p><p>It was easy for them to enumerate awful things. Google and Facebook run an advertising duopoly that is annihilating publishers and journalists around the globe. Amazon operates its marketplace and also sells on it, creating irresistible incentives for bad behavior. Apple acts as an explicitly monopolistic gatekeeper for apps that want to reach its 25% of all mobile devices, which live in the pockets of a well-heeled and desirable demographic.</p><p>                     Ranking the CEOs:  Jeff  Bezos was the best, offering short clear answers and, when he didn't have them, saying so. Sundar Pichai was the worst, refusing straight talk even when in a strong position.</p><p>Then there's this from Bezos: \"The rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the US.\" Um, I don't think so.</p><p>                     Biggest problem:  The absence of Microsoft, which has been in trouble for monopolistic behavior since code was carved on stone tablets.</p><p>                     Biggest                     lies:  Tim  Cook claiming that developers who didn't like the App Store have lots of other places to go, for example Xbox. Mark Zuckerberg saying: \"Cookies is not a big part of how we're collecting information.\" Bezos feigning surprise at a marketplace seller crying foul over shoddy governance.</p><p>Congress roll of honor:  Chairman David Cicilline for oratory. For zeroing in on Google's at-best-sleazy dealings with Genius lyrics and Yelp. For highlighting the implicit conflicts in selling on a market you own. For pointing out that optimizing for engagement can optimize for anger and hate.</p><p>Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal for her argument that Amazon's controls against its staff using Seller data to compete against them are somewhere between feeble and laughable. For highlighting Facebook's habit of convincing upcoming rivals that acquisition is preferable to being crushed. For pointing out that in Google's ad ecosystem, it is simultaneously on the buy-side and the sell-side while also offering broker services; as she points out \"There's a reason we have laws against insider trading.\"</p><p>Congresswoman Val Demings for highlighting Google's merging of advertising and tracking data so her search history, Gmail data, and travels round the web are all merged in a single database. Ewww.</p><p>Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon for rubbing Bezos's face in what looked like scandalously predatory pricing in the diapers.com episode.</p><p>Congressman Jerry Nadler for zeroing in on the devastation of the publishing industry and the journalism profession.</p><p>Congress walk of shame: Featuring Republicans for endless high-decibel whining about how the big techs are \"censoring conservatives\". And a tip o' the hat to Congressman Jamie Raskin who dunked on them, pointing out that on any recent day most of the top posts on Facebook are alt-right propaganda: \"If Facebook is trying to suppress conservative speech, they're doing a terrible job at it.\"</p><p>                     Closing words:  From Chairman Cicilline's wrap-up: \"This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable ... their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end.\"</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Tim Bray is a 40-year veteran of big tech, who has worked for Sun Microsystems, Google and Amazon</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64880867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-C051-F021-61KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><timeReceived>3:38 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

That's when the problems started.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It didn't really track my face that well,\" says Buolamwini, who is a black Ghanaian-American woman. \"Then lighter-skinned people would use it and it would run away and I was like, 'Hey! I built this for me. But it works for you'.\"</p><p>She laughs. Hectoring, it becomes apparent, is not her style. Sitting in the Barbican, where she has an exhibit at the recently opened show, AI: More than Human, she guffaws infectiously at the near comic outrageousness of the tech world's injustices, preferences and prejudices, which together reveal a combination of immense power and astonishing immaturity. It's a world in which algorithms help to decide every facet of our lives: who gets a mortgage, or a place at university, or a job, or stopped by the police. And yet those algorithms are themselves unchecked by the basic safety protocols that we would expect in any other industry of comparable importance.</p><p>\"We just assume because it's a machine or because we've used data that decisions are going to be fair or neutral,\" she says. \"But we find when you look under the hood, something's rotting, and no one was checking in the first place.\" It was a realisation brought home to Buolamwini at Hallowe'en. As part of her costume she put on a white face mask. The Aspire Mirror instantly whirred into action. \"The mask was detected so quickly compared to my real face. That was the moment I realised something was going on\".</p><p>She then read a report called The Perpetual Line-up, by the Georgetown Center for Law and Privacy, which revealed the extent of unregulated facial recognition by the FBI and police. Its findings caused shock waves: more than 117million American adults were affected, their faces scrutinised by algorithms \"that haven't been audited for accuracy\", says Buolamwini.</p><p>She wondered if it wasn't just her having issues with facial recognition. \"What about all of these people in these police data sets - could they be falsely mismatched?\" The implications could be huge. \"When your face gets mistakenly associated with something you haven't done, are they going to believe you, or the machine?\" The effect is most obvious on what Buolamwini describes as the \"undersampled majority\" - women and people of colour, who don't appear proportionally in the data-sets on which AI algorithms are trained.</p><p>She recalls a spat she had with Amazon over AI used in the early stages of its hiring process. \"It was trained on 10 years of hiring data for software developers,\" she explains, \"and what they found was that a resume using the word 'women's',\" - be they members of a women's hockey or debating team - \"would be categorically ranked lower than those that didn't.\"</p><p>The problem was that in the previous 10 years, most developers were men. Of course, that didn't mean men were always the best developers. \"So instead of actually finding patterns that say you're good for the job, it's finding patterns that are characteristic of those who had been in the job in the past.\"</p><p>Amazon disputed Buolamwini's conclusions. But it scrapped the AI system. Do we want to live in a world, she asks, \"where you don't get a job or get into college, not because you were unworthy but because AI rendered you irrelevant?\" The problem is not usually down to malice. Rather, studies reveal how dramatically under-represented women and minorities are in big tech companies - \"the G-Mafia\", Buolamwini calls them. That can lead to so-called \"unconscious bias\". She happily admits she is not free of it herself, recalling one of her projects involving the Fitzpatrick scale, used by dermatologists to measure response to UV radiation. \"I had no idea you could get sunburn in different ways. But sunburn is not something I have to think about.\"</p><p>She calls the translation of such blind spots to the digital world, \"the coded gaze\" - where users simply don't think about the injustices others face because they aren't exposed to them.</p><p>Some fixes, she says, are obvious: improve the ethnic and gender balance of teams creating algorithms; assume bias and bake mitigation processes into development; subject AI to the same ongoing, verified standards and norms as engineering or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>\"Right now, you just take your AI model without a lot of information, shake it around and hope it works. We have an industry that doesn't have due diligence. We can do better.\"</p><p>Not, she says, that we can rely on industry to self-regulate. Which is why she founded the Algorithmic Justice League, to highlight coded discrimination. The superhero-style name is a touch of communications genius from a sharply dressed woman who styles herself \"the poet of code\", and is leveraging her rapidly rising profile to make an impact at Davos, the UN, and the EU Global Tech panel.</p><p>Exposure to politicians is not always heartening. \"There's such a lack of AI literacy that you can get into a situation where the people tasked with regulating technology don't really know how it works\".</p><p>By contrast, Buolamwini, born in Canada to an artist and a medicinal chemistry professor, who grew up in Ghana and Oxford, Mississippi, before getting a scholarship to Oxford, England, and did her PhD at MIT, has a background that oozes authority.</p><p>Her main message, she insists, is against \"technological determinism\" - the idea that the march forwards is both inevitable and immutable. Look at IBM and Microsoft, she says, which changed their facial recognition software in response to her work; look at the UK, where this week police use of facial recognition will be challenged in court for the first time; look at Amazon's shareholders, who are voting tomorrow on whether to ban the continued development of its own facial recognition software.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, it is up to us to define what the future will be, to have the political will. Ultimately, AI is not a tech issue. It is a people issue.\"</p><p>Is she an optimist? \"San Francisco's decision has made me more optimistic than ever,\" she says, referring to the vote to ban facial recognition used by police and government agencies.</p><p>Yet that the West Coast capital of Silicon Valley has taken such a step, she thinks, should give us all pause. \"The city where the sausage is made does not want to eat the sausage,\" she says, laughing again. \"That tells you something.\"</p><p>'When your face gets mistakenly associated, are they going to believe you?'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>a - 10 of CHRISTOPHER PLEDGER FOR THE TELEGRAPH;

France and the UK proposed levies on the revenue technology giants generate locally, angering the Trump administration.Amazon, Facebook, and Google have all lobbied against the plans. Both countries recently drew back from their tax plans and Vestager said if within a year no progress has been made the EU will draw up its own tech tax. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Margrethe Vestager, the EU lawmaker who Donald Trump has criticized and described as Europe's \"tax lady\",[2] has thrown her weight behind plans to tax tech firms for the revenue they make in European markets. </p><p>As Europe's competition commissioner, Vestager slapped tech companies including Google[3] and Apple[4] with record-breaking fines. In September 2019,[5]she was also appointed to oversee Europe's digital policy, broadening her remit and power. Vestager told reporters on Thursday that she was in favor of regulation which would tax big tech companies for the revenue they make within a country, adding that the EU will step in to make a similar tax within a year if international efforts to construct such taxes fail. As it stands, no country taxes the major tech companies on the revenue they make overseas. They are instead taxed on profits. The UK and France have both proposed similar laws that would radically alter this, taxing tech firms between 2% and 3% of local revenue. The idea is to counteract the effect of complex tax setups which allow the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Google to funnel sales through low-tax European countries, thereby minimizing their tax. Europe's moves towards a revenue tax have prompted fury from the Trump administration, since the rule change would predominantly impact Amazon, Facebook, Google, and the other US giants. The three firms have all lobbied against such tax changes[6], describing France's plans as \"unjustifiable.\" Following an intense trade battle in which Trump threatened to levy tariffs on French cheese and wine President Macron agreed to delay France's tech tax[7]. Meanwhile, the OECD instructed the UK to \"hold fire\" on its own tax[8], which was due to come into force in April. These road bumps seem to have spurred Vestager on. \"I think it is very important that we keep up the momentum. Because of this very fundamental injustice that most people and businesses pay their taxes and they are competing with businesses who create value but do not pay taxes,\" said Vestager, as reported by the Guardian[9]. This isn't the first time the EU has talked about imposing its own tech tax, a 3% tax was proposed in 2018 but was scuppered by a handful of member states[10] including Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark.

The EU's top competition official, Margrethe Vestager, has shown an appetite for taking on Silicon Valley's tech firms with multiple investigations and fines. But on Wednesday, she said a breakup wouldn't be a \"silver bullet\" for more competition. </p><p>Vestager is four years into her five-year term and she won't necessarily have enough time to chop up Google. There's lots of speculation that Google will eventually be broken up, and that if a split happens, it will be European regulators who are responsible. The woman most likely to pick up the axe is Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, who has overseen multiple anti-trust investigations and just handed Google a $5 billion penalty for abusing its dominance of Andriod[1]. Asked in a press conference whether a Google break-up would be good for competition, Vestager replied: \"I don't know. I don't know if it would serve the purpose of more competition to have Google broken up. \"I think what will serve competition is for more players to have a real go to be able to reach consumers. So we can use our choice to find out what suits us the best.\" But later Vestager pointed out that she might not be competition commissioner long enough to break up Google. Her mandate lasts for five years and she is already four years in. She has indicated that she would like a second term[2]. She said: \"It would definitely not be for this mandate. Even if I was lucky enough to get the next one, maybe not for that one either. The thing is, I think we should have competition and I don't think there are any silver bullets in breaking up a company to do that. \"And here we have a decision which is very clear, which will allow mobile device producers to have a choice. That will allow us as consumers to have a choice as well. That's what competition is about. And I think that is much more important than a discussion of whether or not breaking up a company would do that.\" Google shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief just yet. Vestager immediately added her support for a new law proposed by the EU[3] that would regulate how Google, Apple, and other big tech firms deal with smaller businesses. It would give small businesses transparency around areas like how search results are ranked, and why big firms delist some services. She also said back in March[4] that the breakup of Google was a question that should still be \"open and on the agenda.\"NOW WATCH: These 13 medical technologies are changing lives[5]See Also: Here

And welcome to those of you who are here with us in the auditorium, and also those who are watching online, and via a live Facebook feed.</p><p>We're talking this morning about China and Global 5G, although our topic is a little bit broader than that, and the subtitle is, \"Trying To Get The Questions Right.\" Trying to frames the issues that you have been reading about probably every morning, which seem to be unfolding at a dizzying rate. Trying to get the questions right about what is technology based, what is national security based, what is economic.</p><p>Over the past three -- over the past five years really, there have been three major changes in US-China relations, all related. The first, is that the relationship that has always been both competitive and cooperative is now characterized more by contention, by adversity, than by engagement. There has been a fundamental shift to a more competitive, or a more contentious relationship.</p><p>The second major change, I would argue, is that this is now a worldwide competition. This is not just Beijing to Washington. The competition is playing out globally as these two nations compete to play leading roles in shaping security architectures, trading and financial regimes, norms and practices, and values systems.</p><p>And then, third large change is that these nations are also competing to play a leading role in the development, sale, installation, and regulation of new technologies. Much as Beijing and Washington disagree, one of the issues that both sides now seem to agree on is that innovation, masterly and leadership of 5G systems, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, emerging bio technologies.</p><p>The masterly of technologies henceforth is going to be the key to hard power, military power, economic power, soft power, and global leadership. Beijing and Washington seem to agree on this.</p><p>Already this focus on innovation has caused major difficulties for academia, and we spent a lot of time on this at the Kissinger Institute, trying to help American universities, colleges, and the national institutions that manage them, understand how they can remain free and open universities while responding to very real threats from Beijing and security concerns from Washington.</p><p>So it's an interest -- it's of interest to academics, but it's much bigger than that. I think what we see again, if you're watching the daily flow of news, is that our technophilia and our technophobia are merging with our xenophilia and xenophobia, and have become a way of asking about our own national well-being and our place in the world.</p><p>This tech challenge from China is causing us to rethink some of our economic models, our defense models, and our modes of governance. And this is true not only in the United States, but in many leading industrialized nations.</p><p>In a piece yesterday, in the \"Financial Times\" called \"China Gains The Upper Hand Over Germany,\" the author, Wolfgang Munchau, I apologize for slaughtering the pronunciation of his last name, put it like this.</p><p>He said, \"This is a fundamental European problem. Unlike in China, macroeconomic policy, industrial policy, and foreign and security policy in Europe are run independently of each other. The Huawei 5G bid shows that the EU is not well prepared to deal with the connection between security and industrial policy, nor have the Europeans paid much attention to the impact of their fiscal rules, not least on defense and security policies. China, by contrast, has an integrated approach to economic and foreign policy.\"</p><p>And so, this is a new issue. It touches on many aspects of our national well-being and, therefore, it's not surprising that we have been overreacting in some cases, and have had difficulty framing these issues poorly. As we said in our advertisement for this event today, there are at least three different levels that we see in our concern about 5G and Chinese technology generally. This tends to focus around questions of Huawei right now, but it's broader than Huawei.</p><p>One is the the specific concern about espionage, about backdoors, and other means of spying through installed Chinese technologies. And also, the vulnerability that the use of Chinese components may cause for various aspects of our national infrastructure. So is it a discreet espionage and security issue.</p><p>Then there's the level of commercial competition, and you will often read in the same article, the same paragraph that this is about keeping our own national champions, our own companies at the lead of these new technologies. Our need, our desire to dominate these technologies and retain our pre-eminence also plays into the reception of Chinese components, Chinese technologies.</p><p>And there's a claim, sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit, that even if China's methods of competition were licit, if they played by fair rules, and there are many cases in which they seem not to, even if they were that China's ambitions to technological greatness are somehow illegitimate, or a de facto threat, even if the rules of the road were observed.</p><p>And then there's also the level at which the technological competition becomes the key to a competition for global preeminence. So, obviously, there's a lot of overlap between these three kinds of concerns. But the categories are often confused in our public discourse, and it often reads as though the installation of Chinese-made 5G routers and servers may be a key factor, not just in competition between global tech firms, but it often reads like a key factor in the historic struggle between good and evil.</p><p>Some of this bowls down to, who do you like? Who do you trust, America or China, going forward? So today, we're going to try to work out where we are, and we are delighted to have three leading experts and different aspects of these questions.</p><p>We will hear first from Naomi Wilson, who is the Senior Director of Policy for Asia at the Information Technology Industry Council, or ITI, where she focuses on law enforcement and homeland security, cyber security, especially with relation to China and Asia.</p><p>Before joining ITI, she was at The US Department of Homeland Security, where she was most recently, the Acting Director for Asia-Pacific, where she played a leading role on cyber security, law enforcement and customs cooperation issues as a Senior Adviser to then Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson.</p><p>She also led the development and implementation of policy initiatives at the Department of Homeland Security for its engagement with China in the area of cyber crime and related issues. It also worked on the US-China high-level dialogue on cybercrime. Prior to that she was on the staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p><p>And, like all of our speakers today, is a Mandarin speaker, a mandarin expert. Yes, so that's, sort of, a key criteria for taking the stage today</p><p>She'll be followed by Jimmy Goodrich to my left, who is the Vice President for Global Policy at the Semiconductors Industry Association. In that capacity he works closely with all of the member companies, the administration here at the White House, Congress, domestic and international stakeholders, and also foreign government officials to try to advance the Semiconductors Industry Association's international policy agenda.</p><p>He's also an executive committee member of the United States Information Technology Office where he represents the SIA. Jimmy has over a decade of experience, working with Chinese and global stakeholders on tech issues and also served recently as the Director of Global Policy at ITI, where he worked on China, Asia-Pacific tech policy issues related to cyber security, trade and internet governance.</p><p>Prior to that, he also worked on government affairs, Greater China government affairs for Cisco Systems.</p><p>Jimmy will then be followed by Dennis Wilder, who is, I think, probably known to most of you. He is Assistant Professor of the Practice in Asian Studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, and also serves as Managing Director of Georgetown's initiative for US-China dialogue on global issues.</p><p>Before coming to Georgetown, he served as the National Security Council's Director for China from 2004 to 2005, and then, as the NSC Special Assistant to the President, and Senior Director for East Asian Affairs for '05 to '09, which took him up to Asia many times, including for the Beijing Olympics in 2008. You had a seat in the stands.</p><p>WILDER: I did.</p><p>DALY: Very good.</p><p>WILDER: I got to see Mr. Phelps do his thing in the great bubble there.</p><p>DALY: Ah.</p><p>WILDER: And it was tremendous. And, of course, the American dream team of basketball.</p><p>DALY: Which was the opening game.</p><p>WILDER: Which was the opening game. And I must say the Chinese audience cheered just as loudly for the American team as they did for the Chinese team (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DALY: From 09 to 2015, Dennis served as Senior Editor of the president's \"Daily Brief\". And this is the worldwide intelligence update, which is produced under the Director of National Intelligence, which begins the day in the White House.</p><p>WILDER: It used to.</p><p>DALY: We're not going to go into that today.</p><p>From 2015 to 2016, he was the CIA's Deputy Assistant Director for East Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>So, a great lineup today. Again, thanks to all of you for coming. And I would like, in particular, to thank my colleague, Ray (ph) Jung (ph) at the Kissinger Institute, who leads for us on following all things tacking. Who is a key driver in putting this together today. So thanks for -- to you Ray.</p><p>So again, let's start with Naomi, and then we'll go to Jimmy and Dennis. Thank you.</p><p>WILSON: Sure. Well, thank you very much for having me this morning. It's great to see all of you, and your interest in China and US tech issues.</p><p>So I'll start off by saying Robert, thank you for holding this event. In particular, your framing of the need to get the questions right is especially important, because we're in an environment with a lot of assumptions, a lot of assertions, and a lot of conflation, where facts are not necessarily relied upon in a way that I think we would like to see them.</p><p>So essentially, you can't understand the problem until you understand what question you're trying to solve for. So discussions like this are extremely helpful. There's a definite need to have informed discussions, to talk about threats and risks, and what they mean in the context of US and China and tech, and how and whether threats can be mitigated.</p><p>Just to say, it's China, therefore, it's a threat is not sufficient in a global economy. And it's not instructive as we look to see how the US can advance in technological innovations, and compete with China going forward. So at ITI, which is my association, we pride ourselves on working with the public sector to develop fact-based and rigorous analysis of problems and assessments, and try to find out what is the right policy solution going forward.</p><p>So, in my opening remarks today, I'd like to outline a few things. First is, how the US government and industry view challenges with respect to China and tech. And I'll be pulling a little bit from my background at DHS, as well as my current position at ITI working with tech companies.</p><p>I'll also speak a bit to how the US government perspective has evolved over the past few years and into the current administration. And the need for public and private sector partnership in order to identify these questions and work together to resolve them.</p><p>So with that -- with respect to the US government and industry concerns, I would say that they are similar. Yet there are differences in tactics and approach. And obviously, for the US government in particular, there is a heavy emphasis on what constitutes a national security threat.</p><p>I will say that I feel very fortunate in the private sector that the tech industry has such a good relationship with the US government, especially with issues that are of greatest concern regarding China's tech policies. The US government has been great at listening to industry input and concerns in terms of understanding the dynamics of that market.</p><p>So industry concerns should come as no real surprise. These are long-standing concerns involving market access, foreign companies' inability to obtain licenses and compete on equal footing with Chinese companies. Data localization requirements, forced partnerships with Chinese companies, and security review regimes that are ambiguous to say the least.</p><p>DALY: Data localization requirements, could you speak on that a little bit.</p><p>WILSON: OK, fine. I did not use an acronym though, I get points for that. So data localization is an issue that we see not only in China but around the world. Tech companies -- not only tech companies, any modern-day multinational company, relies on the flow of data across cross borders for purposes of serving their customers, and it's not only customers, but it's also cyber security data. For example, sharing vulnerabilities to determine whether certain systems are affected and how to patch those vulnerabilities.</p><p>So that instantaneous, real-time flow of information is essential to doing business and to maintaining network security. China and other countries have taken to instituting, or at least drafting, policies that require data to be maintained in country. So companies are required to build servers that house the data in country, the idea being that, if it's closer then law enforcement, government has greater access to it, or easier access, or they can control it to a better degree. Those were all false assumptions, but that's another conversation. So I'll stop there on data localization.</p><p>So in terms of the US government concerns, currently we see an array of concerns, and I think this is emblematic of policymakers and US citizens trying to come to terms with the competitive and cooperative dynamics between the US and China, and to what extent economic security also affects national security.</p><p>So we've seen a lot of blurred lines between these two elements that used to be dealt with with pretty distinctly, and I want to make clear also that when we talk about security, and especially national security, I know that often there's a number of characterizations in the media of big tech companies, and putting the profit first.</p><p>I want to make clear that tech companies take national security and security of systems, in general, extremely seriously. It is part of their livelihood, it is what they stake their name on, and their consumers trust in them on. So it's really not an either-or situation from a tech company perspective, and I want to make that clear.</p><p>In terms of what we hear most often from the US government regarding their concerns, it's a mix of economic and security. A lot of them near our own concerns, along the lines of market access and unfair Chinese tech and trade policies. And these are being dealt with currently in the context of the 301 investigation, which is why led by USTR, and the ongoing trade talks.</p><p>We also see concerns with respect to the economic impact of IP theft, as well as what it means to have an unfair technological advantage, and what risk that poses in the future. Chinese investment in the US is another security concern that the US government has worked on over the past year. We've seen the reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS, which was reformed via legislation last year, as well as attention to export control laws, which control the export of potentially sensitive technology for national security purposes. And commerce is working on implementing an updated process of that right now.</p><p>Then we see the various supply chain concerns, and this varies from respect to specific companies, or the desire to move supply chains back to the US, and we see -- it seems like on a weekly basis, new Bills coming out of the Hill that have this focus on, what does the supply chain mean to security, and to American economic status generally?</p><p>And finally, there's the question of technological competitiveness, and is China winning in the race for AI and 5G. So as the US government is trying to deal with all of these things, and as the private sector is trying to keep up with their efforts to deal with all of these various policies, and inform that process, I think it's also important to take a step back and to look at the evolution of the current USG concerns.</p><p>So, over the past decade, the US government has become become somewhat used to China gaming the system, and playing by its own rules. There had been a general thought that bringing China into the fold -- into the international system would help normalize Chinese practices over time. And this has worked in some respects and not others. I think we've seen pretty dramatic changes, outside of the realm of tech, in China's approach to climate change. But with respect to their alignment with the WTO, not so much,</p><p>So, there is a general acceptance, as you mentioned Robert, in your opening remarks, of the competitive-cooperative relationship between the US and China. And I think that is still true, and that needs to be constantly reinforced, because China is not going to be going anywhere, and we're not going to be going anywhere. And our relationships are so intertwined that is behooves us to make sure that that relationship functions.</p><p>So in the current administration, I've seen the US become increasingly fed up with China's behavior, and beginning to respond in a more assertive way. And this goes back to the previous administration. There was definitely a shift towards the end of the Obama administration of being more assertive, tolerating more friction in the relationship, and accepting that China might be embarrassed by certain things and react. So we might no longer have a cyber dialogue between the two countries.</p><p>And so, China responded to a number of US actions, including indictments of Chinese PLA hackers, increasingly public criticism of China's theft of IP via cyber hacking including right up to the run-up of President Xi's 2015 state visit with President Obama. And sanctioning Chinese companies for violations of US export controls.</p><p>So in the current administration, and in Congress there's increasingly heightened concerns and tech seems to be more and more at the center. There's even less tolerance for Chinese behavior and empty commitments. And I think there's a lot of validity to that sentiment.</p><p>So right now, we see the administration, in particular, USTR Ambassador Lighthizer, coming down harder on China's unfair trade practices. We see new supply chain policies and legislation, many of which have named specific companies and intend to ban those companies. Export control reform.</p><p>And this has all led to increasing and, I think, troubling drive to wall off US tech in order to safeguard it, and to protect our crown jewels that may be used for national security purposes and/or for competitive advantage. And there's been a lot of talk of bringing the supply chains back to the US, and why can't you just get out of China? Why don't you make things in the US? It would be so much better for the US economy. Nver mind that we're in a global economy with intertwined supply chains. And restricting exports of our valued technology.</p><p>So policymakers are asking a lot of big, complex questions that will have significant ripple effects for the tech sector, for the economy, and for US technological competitiveness. And, I think, how is a really important time to step back and unpack those questions and unpack the assumptions that are leading to those questions and the potential policy solutions on the table.</p><p>And this is where the private and public public sector partnership is essential. And I'll take an example of cyber security, so that to be clear. So with respect to cyber security, the US government is not on private sector networks. So they rely on the private sector to tell them what is going on, especially with respect to hacking for economic purposes.</p><p>The US government certainly has its own tools and insights in terms of general espionage practices, but they don't have the whole picture and neither does the tech sector, and the companies. So in order to understand the problem and ask ourselves the right questions, we really need that full picture.</p><p>So it's essential that the private sector and the public sector collaborate, compare notes, and come up with the right solutions. And we can start by acknowledging that there are security concerns. There are risks. But we have to insist that any concern be dealt with in an evidence-based and rigorous process-oriented approach.</p><p>So from my perspective, we look at, what is the risk? Can the risk be mitigated? What are current tools available? And how do we scope the tools, or create new tools to avoid unintended or adverse consequences? And, speaking for ITI, we have worked extensively with Congress and the US government in terms of CFIUS reform as well as export controls reform. Helping to shed some light on how to scope these important policies that are clearly geared towards a national-security need, appropriately in a way, that we are not jeopardizing our own innovation and technological progress going forward. I'll stop there.</p><p>DALY: Thank you Naomi. Jimmy.</p><p>GOODRICH: Sure. Thanks. And I think Naomi framed really well -- thinking about the broad picture between balancing security and economics. In my role in the Semiconductors Industry Association, I've been thinking about the US-China technology competition from the dynamic of commercial competitiveness.</p><p>And I'll talk a little bit about, what exactly is 5G? What are the technologies of the future? What does it mean for the US? And what is China doing about them? So we have a factual, sort of, landscape of , what's at stake? What's the economic cost and incentive for looking at these issues?</p><p>And I think we a pretty well positioned to have a good outlook into this for the semiconductor industry. Roughly about a third of everything we sell goes into a communicative device. So, US chip makers from Intel all the way down to companies in North Carolina, Boston are making all of the components that go into 5G and communication systems.</p><p>So you literally can't pass a signal through any 5G or 4G device without a US chip maker. And that's, I think, also a little understood fact that the US, still, is competitive. We haven't lost a race in many areas and there's reasons why. And there areas though where China is making significant inroads. They are becoming successful, and this is for a mix of reasons, both state-led policy-wise, or simple facts are regarding the size of China's economy, and the level of innovation that's happening there.</p><p>And so, it's really important to isolate exactly what we're talking about. What is the technology? Where is it being deployed? And specifically within that, because these are globalized ecosystems, where did the US and China -- it's not just the US-China question either -- where does Korea, Japan, Europe, Canada, where do they play in the global ecosystem?</p><p>Because, whether it's 5G, whether it's AI, whether it's semiconductors, there really is no no single company or country that can dominate the full stack of the technology and the applications. And, in order to make the pie big for everybody, it has to take the world working in concert to move forward and deploy these technologies together.</p><p>Specifically, thinking about 5G, which is really the hot topic that everyone's been hearing about. We just had the Mobile World Congress, it's the annual telecom gathering summit in Barcelona last week. All sorts of headlines about what the technology is going to bring, and also around concerns raised by US government and others regarding security.</p><p>I think, you know, it is important to realize that whenever we look at the security concerns, the economic potential and the commercial side of it is tremendous. And you're talking about the fifth generation of mobile networks that's going to bring upwards of 2,500 times X in terms of download speeds. You'll be able to download a movie roughly in 10 seconds compared to about five to 10 minutes of what you do today.</p><p>So that's really the first evolution of 5G and that's really about making the consumer experience faster, whether it's downloads, watching videos, but 5G is going to be transformational, because it's going to bring huge technological benefits to industries that use 5G. And this is really a game changer, because in previous iterations of 3G and 4G, it was really about making the handset, or the phone experience faster, better.</p><p>And in 5G, because you're bringing something called low latency, meaning that it's basic real time, from the time that data is transmitted to the time you receive it. And also, massive machine-to-machine communication. So you are getting all these IOT sensors hooked up to each other, and that's really what 5G is about.</p><p>It's going to actually transform, if you think about it, agriculture. It's going to transform health care, businesses, industries. And so, because of this transformational capability of 5G, I think that's what's really has brought policymakers' attention to this iteration of the communication standard than previous standards.</p><p>Because frankly, you know, let's realize, you know, telecommunication networks have never had this level of attention than they've had before. And that's because it's so transformational. And so, let alone for the US chip industry, this is a huge opportunity for us. It's an opportunity for the United States as well. I think there's a study by HIS that said by 2035, roughly 1.3 trillion in value will be created by 5G just in the United States alone.</p><p>And the 5G economy will be the size of the GDP of the state of Pennsylvania. So we're talking about huge implications for the United States economically as well. And those have to be weighed against are all the different security considerations, political considerations that governments have worldwide. Because, first and foremost, this is about delivering greater access, greater services to citizens worldwide, so they can participate in the new economy.</p><p>And China is, you know, at the forefront, and thinking about how this is a strategic technology for their country. And this is because the government has recognized, for more than a decade, that they need to have skin in the game when it comes to telecommunications networks.</p><p>Looking back to '90s and early 2000s, virtually everything that China run and operate in terms of their telecom network was imported. Now today, Chinese vendors have about 80 percent of the domestic market share, and foreign countries have 20 percent. About 10 years ago, it was the opposite. So a lot has happened in 10 years, and Chinese companies have closed the gap technologically and from a market share perspective.</p><p>And today, in the worldwide telecom market, you really have only five or six, big key vendors, of which two are Chinese. So, and --</p><p>DALY: None of which are American?</p><p>GOODRICH: In the radio networks. So think about 5G as a big ecosystem, and you have the core networks that transmit the data and process it inside the telecommunications service providers network. You have the wireless base stations that transmit the signals. Then you have the cell phones and your IOT devices that help you interact --</p><p>WILDER: IOT is Internet of things.</p><p>GOODRICH: -- Internet of things. I lose points for an acronym. And then, beyond that, you have all the components and chip vendors, and to say that, you know, China is dominating the 5G -- which is actually incorrect. Just, for example, looking at chips for, one point an example, the US has about half the entire worldwide market. For 5G communications, it's more than that. And the other half frankly, are mostly non-Chinese companies. South Korea, Taiwanese, and others.</p><p>So there's many areas where China has been very good at innovating. And there's other areas, where they're still very weak, even in the 5G ecosystem. And, I think, there's -- we cannot deny, one logical reason is that the size of China's economy has driven a lot of the scale that has made Chinese companies successful.</p><p>And then, the second factor, of course, is the role of the government is far more outsized than it is here in the United States. And also, they're just keen on industrial planning. And that's something that's been historical about China. And moving forward, particularly under the current administration, China seems to be strengthening and accelerating. And that brings both benefits and drawbacks for China's technological ecosystem.</p><p>Just thinking about the size and scale for China to have the world's largest fixed access network, broadband network, mobile network, Internet users, number of Internet transactions, nearly all the world cell phones, laptops, PCs, flat panel displays are all manufactured in China.</p><p>And so, China is central to this debate, whether it's deployment, development, or the security issues. And they have a lot at stake. But, you know, I think we also have to recognize that China's government has played a significant role. And if you look back to 2G and 3G and 4G in China, and look at Beijing, through the 3G and 4G deployment, and working closely with companies now known as Nortel and Motorola and others.</p><p>You know, they faced a really tough challenge at the time, because the government had very clear orders for their three state-owned carriers, that they were going to buy domestic, and that's exactly what happened. And given the home court advantage that some of those large Chinese telecommunications companies had, they allowed them to build up scale, and invest into the R&amp;D. And then also, move into overseas markets in places like Southeast Asia, Philippines, Africa, and compete usually on an under-pricing strategy against global telecommunications vendors.</p><p>And that was about 10 years ago, and that's all history, and it all happened. And since then, though, I think you see, particularly in the telecommunications space, you know, US and global companies are competitive today That if you look at the -- whether it's the patent or the IP landscape, but Chinese companies, particularly in this space, have significantly closed the gap. And have made the question of, with or without China? Almost impossible to answer, because they're so central to both the deployment and the development of the technology.</p><p>So thinking about, you know, this competition, or the development of this technology in the future, it has to be, how do the US and China figure out to compartmentalize and manage their security concerns and risks? And then, how do they also figure out how to unleash their technology? Because both the United States and China, both stand to benefit from whether it's 5G, AI or quantum computing being developed from a commercial perspective.</p><p>And their industries stand to benefit, and the more the governments think about regulating for security purposes, the less we're going to see those benefits given, I think, to consumers in any other country. So there's a lot at stake from a commercial and technological perspective. And again, going back to Naomi's point, it's really important to think about, what exactly we're talking about? What is the technology? Where are the linkages between the US, China and other countries?</p><p>It's more than just the US, its global. This is a global technology, global ecosystem. And so, you know, no question on future technology at the moment can be answered with just the US and China alone. So I'll stop there. I want to save my remarks for the rest of the discussion.</p><p>We just want to frame some of the baseline issues of, what are we talking about from a technological perspective? What's the opportunity, both from a commercial perspective? And then, how do those influence government's perspectives on security? Again, I think that's because these are truly transformational technologies, and moreso, than they were in the past. And so, we just have to live with the fact that governments are going to be paying attention. And how do we direct that attention into a positive channel? Thanks.</p><p>DALY: Oh, thank you. We've focused so far on the technological and commercial sides, maybe turning a little more to the security end of the equation now with Dennis.</p><p>WILDER: Great. First of all, let me commend Robert and the Wilson Center for putting this event together today. Given the turnout, it's obvious that it's an important issue that needs more discussion. Although I would have liked to have seen how many of you showed up if we did have the snowstorm today. But you did get here.</p><p>One of the wonderful things about my transition out of US government to the academic world is, I can now speak quite freely. So let me be very clear that I speak for myself today, not the US government, or Georgetown University. I'm giving you my personal views today, and some of them will be pretty candid.</p><p>Let me start by reinforcing something that Jimmy and Naomi have said. And that is, why are we sitting here today? We're sitting here today, because we're dealing with a cutting-edge technology in 5G. The CEO of Cisco was on television yesterday, and he said, in this particular case, the technology is living up to the hype.</p><p>And I think from Jimmy's remarks about movie downloading, and the rest of it, you can see that we are entering unknown territory. This is really a new, if you will, industrial revolution that we're on the verge of. And so, with all this promise comes an unknown realm for national policymaking, and national policymaking, under the best of circumstances, is difficult and tends to be behind the times. I think we can all agree in Washington to that.</p><p>But now, we are in a phrase where we're dealing with an unknown dimension, international actors and an atmosphere of distrust. That makes national policymaking incredibly complicated on this issue. Now, let me say that, having served in government for over three decades, I think we've so far understated the Sea Change in American policy today. And I want to really hit it harder.</p><p>For the five -- past five decades, since Kissinger went to China, the premise of American policy was that we could work with China, that we would be finding common ground. But I'm afraid -- I have to say that Americans in this town, maybe not all over the United States, are now seeing President Xi, as more like mild, than like Dong (ph) Jianying (ph).</p><p>We were more comfortable with Dong (ph) Jianying (ph) than Mao, let's face it. And we thought that Dong (ph) was bringing China closer to being more like us than less like us. Whereas we now see President Xi taking steps that seem to be accentuating the differences between our two cultures and societies.</p><p>This reassessment has been building for some time. This is not the Trump administration. This is across the political spectrum of the United States. And one of the things that we saw, and Naomi referred to it, but I want to hit it a little harder again is, that China is not playing as much by the international liberal order rules as we expected.</p><p>So in the cyber realm, we saw the PLA and the Ministry of State Security becoming much bolder in their commercial cyber espionage. PLA Unit 61398 in Shanghai has been labeled the APT 1. It's notorious - hundreds, dozens, if not hundreds, of human actors involved in that PLA organization, who have attacked 141 different organizations around the world.</p><p>Hackers associated with the Tianjin Bureau of the Ministry of State Security labeled APT 10, similarly indicted by the Trump administration in December of 2018 for hacking managed service providers by uploading malicious software to gain access in the economic intelligence from at least 12 countries, and the personal data of 100,000 US naval personnel.</p><p>This is not a secret, this is in the indictment, OK. These are not rogue actors. These are professionals. How do we know they're professionals? Because they do their work during office hours in China. That's how you know they're professionals. It's not that hard to figure out, OK.</p><p>Now, why does the Chinese government allow such activity? Well simply put, they're a different set of standards. In all my years in US intelligence, and I am being absolutely truthful here, I never once handed information to an American company, or considered handing the information to an American firm for economic competitive of reasons. Why? There is no US law that allows me to do that.</p><p>Robert Gates, who was the Director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense, said in an interview two years ago that he actually contemplated this. That he went to officials in the administration, while he was Director of Central Intelligence, and asked if he could start helping American companies. And the answer was not only no, but hell no, we're not doing this, and we don't do this.</p><p>James Clapper, a couple years ago said, it is not a secret that the intelligence community collects information about economic and financial matters. What we do not, as we have said many times too, is use our foreign intelligence capability to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness, or increase their bottom line.</p><p>Frankly, one of the problems is, who would you hand it to? Do you hand it to Google? Do you hand it to Intel? Do you hand it to Apple? How do you decide who do you give this competitive edge to? And believe me, the moment you handed it to one of them, you're going to get a lawsuit in an American court as fast as possible by the others.</p><p>So it's not feasible and we don't do it. That's not to say that some of our allies, by the way, don't do it. Robert Gates said that about 12 to 20 countries around the world do, do economic espionage for the benefit of their corporations. So, I think, that we have to understand that there is reason for the American government concern, because of these aggressive behavior in the cyber espionage area. It's not a figment of our imagination.</p><p>However, the question that Robert has posed today is a different one. And that is, the US claims of China's ability to install equipment to spy or attack digital infrastructure. Now, personally, I've seen no credible reporting today that any cyber attacks against the United States were conducted by embedded code in Chinese supplied hardware.</p><p>If we look back, for example, at the largest data breach ever involving the United States, where 21.5 million Americans personal records were lost by OPM. I think the conclusion on that is there were contractors with Chinese passports involved in that project. It had nothing to do with the equipment itself. It had everything to do with insider threat.</p><p>And the US government has come forward with no evidence on Huawei, or any other firm, cooperating with the Chinese government for intelligence purposes. When the Australian government decided to put a ban on Huawei, they said publicly, quote, \"The government considers that the involvement of vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law may risk failure by the carrier to adequately protect a 5G network.\"</p><p>They did not say that they had evidence. We've seen some uncorroborated reports in the French press, in the Australian press, and we had this case of a Bloomberg article in October of 2018, that suggested there was actually a microchip. That has been totally and completely discounted as fabrication. The company did an audit. The head of Apple has said this did not occur, so that is not factual. Somebody made up a story and gave it to Bloomberg, And unless somebody in this room has some evidence to the contrary, that story should go away and never be talked about again, because it's just not true, it's awful, it's a hoax.</p><p>So if we have no clear evidence of Huawei's involvement in malicious Chinese government cyber attacks, why call for the bans? Simply put, it's because it's not difficult to see how Beijing could use Huawei. You've already heard about the various Chinese laws that require Chinese firms to cooperate with the Chinese government. And I find the claims by Huawei's lawyers, that these laws don't apply to them to be dubious at best.</p><p>Malicious codes and backdoors into computer hardware is a real risk. Kill switches are technically a reality, and would be a disaster if used suddenly, for example, to take down the entire traffic control system of a city like London. But the real question here comes down to the question of acceptable risk and mitigation.</p><p>I've had the chance, and I'm sure Jimmy and Naomi have too, to meet with officials of the UK's national cyber security center. They make a rather persuasive argument that it's not about banning Huawei, or ZTE, but rather hiving off those areas of the networks of greatest concern to national security, and simply not using those products from China in those systems.</p><p>They left me with the impression that diversification of suppliers and due diligence in testing and monitoring of installed equipment are the keys to making it more difficult for any supplier to act maliciously. I would have to say at this moment, without further evidence, I come down on the side of not banning China companies, except in those areas of highest national security concern.</p><p>China would not rely on US suppliers in its national security telecommunications network, and we shouldn't do the same. But banning Chinese companies entirely does not put us on the road -- puts us on the road -- excuse me, to a digital cold war that I think would have enormous detrimental effects on both sides.</p><p>That said, let me make a few recommendations for the Chinese government and the US government. Very briefly. First, China needs to drop this case against the two Canadians unless it offers explicit evidence of espionage. The fact that so many Chinese officials have said these arrests are linked to the Canadian detention of Ms. Meng is outrageous and counterproductive to Beijing's long-term goals.</p><p>It merely reinforces the notion that the Chinese legal system is highly politicized. The US has put credible evidence of Ms. Meng's crimes before the Canadian courts. These two situations are not equivalent.</p><p>Second, China needs to consider revising its cyber and intelligence laws to make clear that there is a bright line between private firms and the Chinese government. There must be explicit legal procedures in place on how and when the Chinese government gains access to data and capabilities of these companies.</p><p>Third, Huawei itself and ZTE need to be much more transparent about their relationships to the Chinese government. It's simply not credible to those of us in the west, when Huawei's chairman claims that he would deny any Chinese government requests to use his company for espionage. What legal grounds does he have for such a denial? Has he ever done that? How could this firm refuse given the nature of monopolistic and unrestrained power of the Communist Party?</p><p>Fourth, the Chinese government needs to clarify the role of the Communist Party in relation to private companies. We have all read the party has insisted on a greater role recently in the management of private Chinese firms. But what does that mean? What authorities does the party representative have within a firm like Huawei? And what is the real management structure?</p><p>On the US side, let me give one big suggestion. And that is, we need to end our aversion to national industrial policies. There is a great irony in our concern over foreign involvement in 5G development while being heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for parts of the 5G network.</p><p>As with so many areas of US infrastructure, US presidents in the US Congress have woefully -- have been woefully negligent in not coming up with ways to address our infrastructure needs. I am a firm believer that the best way to compete with China is to get our own economic house in order.</p><p>In summary, policymakers in US and other countries have legitimate concerns over China's involvement in the evolving world of 5G. I do not believe this is a case primarily of the United States seeking commercial advantage, but I'm not naive on that point either, and I think some would like to see the disengagement of the United States in China in the telecommunications area.</p><p>But I think that President Trump has made the right choice to date, not to move precipitously to ban Huawei and ZTE from the US marketplace. Such a decision, if ultimately made, needs to be based on sound evidence that the risk of Chinese involvement is too great and cannot be mitigated.</p><p>Such a judgment needs to be made in consultation not only with our companies, as Naomi suggested, but with our allies. And I suspect that many of these people in the private sector understand this issue better than many of those in the US government. Thank you.</p><p>DALY: Thanks to all three of you. That's a, I think, a comprehensive look at that the major issues. I wonder if I could start by asking each of you one quick question and then we'll open it up.</p><p>First, Naomi, and this, sort of, picks up on something that Dennis mentioned, ending the US aversion to national industrial policy. When you think about public-private cooperation, what forms might that take? There's still a strong impulse to leave it to the market in the United States. Whereas in the rest of the world, I quoted this German writer at the beginning, these are macro-economic issues that need to be dealt with across government, across industry.</p><p>The financial, commercial security sectors probably need to be coordinated, it would seem. It's something that looks like an industrial policy. What do you see as prospects for that? What do you see as the major obstacles?</p><p>Then Jimmy, will this will be, sort of, one, two, three. We'll go for the quick answers. You said this 8020 shift has happened over about 10 years, from America supplying 80 percent of the components within Chinese domestic IT system to 20 percent.</p><p>GOODRICH: In telecommunications.</p><p>DALY: In telecommunications. So if that continues, I mean having watched China for a while, we tend to get it wrong. They tend to develop more quickly than we think. What if they get semiconductors? Is that game over? Because that seems to be a lot at the center of some of the policies that you're -- you haven't been advocating policies, but the description you've given depends on American leadership in semiconductors. What are the prospects for that going away? China with its huge market, extensive investments in R&amp;D, its ability to scale up very rapidly as well as perhaps the ability to (INAUDIBLE) steal our technologies. With your basic assessment change, if they get semiconductors, what the prospects for that?</p><p>I must -- Dennis you speak to this, but I'd like to come back to it, because you know a lot of the attitudes that are on the Hill and in Washington more broadly. It's understood that China is seeking what it calls comprehensive national power, which is their way of talking about, sort of, the prestige we enjoy. Commercial security, soft power, and because of our concern about China's quest for comprehensive national power there's a growing sense that anything, any developments that are China's benefit are to our detriment.</p><p>We've even seen reports of Americans going overseas trying to convince allies not to install Huawei equipment, making the argument that we don't need evidence. That we know what we know about China's intentions, the nature of the regime, it's desire to spread the liberalism in generally to develop its own prerogatives worldwide. And, therefore, it doesn't have to be evidence-based, it can be a political decision. And what do you think is the best answer -- you've hinted at that -- to that that approach? So maybe we can just go for those, and then we'll open up all of you. Thank you.</p><p>WILSON: Sure. On public, private sector cooperation and the issue of industrial policy, I will be clear that, that is not what I meant by private sector, public sector cooperation. ITI is very much in favor of market-driven economics, and I would even say that China has demonstrated that industrial policy can go wrong in terms overwhelming a certain sector with subsidies and not causing overcapacity.</p><p>We've seen that in steel and aluminum, probably, most prominently. So what do I mean by public-private sector cooperation? In the security context, it has to do with risk and risk mitigation. And the public sector needs to be telling companies what they see as the risks, what they see as the threats, and what they are using as evidence to draw those conclusions.</p><p>And the private sector also needs to demonstrate and what the risks are. There also needs to be significant amount of work done in the private sector to demonstrate to the public sector how risks are mitigated. I think that is a big, open space face right now, because it's one thing for companies to say we mitigate risk in our supply chain, and on our networks, and it's another thing for them to tell US policymakers in concrete and understandable terms, this is how we mitigate risk. This is how we make a determination as to whether there is an overwhelming risk that merits cutting something out in its entirety, or if, there's a way to approach this in a risk-based manner.</p><p>And finally, this all leads into how to develop the appropriate response and policy. And that policy needs to address any risk that cannot be mitigated, or develop ways to mitigate it, but it also needs to ensure that is not hamstringing technological development. These are companies that are developing next generation technologies, and these are the technologies that the US government touts and say they want to have a competitive advantage in. Technologies related to 5G and artificial intelligence.</p><p>So if they want US companies and multinational companies to be as competitive as possible, they have to understand that there is a need to let the market make some of these determinations, and to not put companies on too short of a leash.</p><p>DALY: Thank you.</p><p>GOODRICH: I will just pick up on that, and then go into China (INAUDIBLE) question, which is a great question. How can I answer that one? I think it is important to remember, you know, the US and China, we're at two very different stages of development. And we're to different economic models. For China, they're a country trying to close the gap, trying to study from others, and there's cases where industrial policy, where it's been very, very inefficient, has still been ultimately accessible from the perspective of the Chinese leadership who look at the end, not the means.</p><p>And sure, China wasted a whole lot of money on 3G. They did proprietary TD-SCDMA standard, which was their version of 3G, and it was incompatible with many parts of the worldwide network. But arguably now, China has learned a lot from that and that 10 billion plus investment they made allowed them to train up a workforce, build up in ecosystem, establish companies, and put them in a position to be able to compete for 5G leadership now that they're done that they've closed the gap technologically.</p><p>So yes, industrial policy can be hugely wasteful and inefficient. Looking at Japan, for example, they also built their own proprietary telecommunications network and that led them down a dead-end road really. But China is actually in some ways learning more than Japan and others did from their mistakes, and has they been willing to be more inclusive of global standards in that space.</p><p>So I think, there's that industrial policy question, for China has its own factors, its own reasons why it is, or isn't successful. The United States, we don't necessarily need industrial policy like China has, because we're not trying to catch up with anyone. We're trying to extend the lead, or innovate entirely new technologies that China isn't even thinking about.</p><p>And, you know, one of those areas, for example, is in semiconductors. Where, as I mentioned, the United States today has the benefit of being the worldwide leader in the technology, whether its market share, technology segments, or chip feature size. Even in the 5G space, your radio chip, your fingerprint sensor, your memory chip, most of it, is American in terms of the components.</p><p>You look at a European telecom box, or a Korean telecom box, it's all going to be the same in terms of chip thunder dominance. And that is exactly why the Chinese government is focused on it is, this is something they don't they make, they see that vulnerability. And they equate it to, you know, the vulnerability of -- China has jet engines, couple of other high value-added manufacturing goods that they just haven't been able to make on their own.</p><p>They've been trying for about 30 years to do so, and they've been wildly unsuccessful. And, I think, that's because this is an industry where you can have a lot of capital, but you also need knowledge of the market, and you need to have smart people. And China, yes, they have the world's largest higher education system. But in terms of quality they actually have a shortage of probably 100,000 to 200,000 engineers who actually know something about semiconductor technology to be able to apply it and be successful.</p><p>So, you know, yes, China has a lot of advantages when it comes to specific industries and technologies. Some of them are just really hard to do. Now, that being said, you know, looking at what happened in telecoms, or high-speed rail, or in solar wind, steel, LED, shipbuilding, there's a track record of success on behalf of China. But again, that success is, sort of, half success in that they get in industry, but at what cost? And what is it do to the global innovation ecosystem? And how much money do they have to spend annually just to keep parts of it alive, because much of it is not very profitable?</p><p>So, you know, I think, in the semiconductor space it's going to be a lot harder for China. The technology involved is simply at a much greater magnitude and complexity when you compare it to steel or aluminum, or even shipbuilding, high-speed rail. You're talking about technology that's developed over decades and $10 billion plus advanced factories with cutting-edge tools, really blending physics, science, math all together. And that's something that we have not seen China do very well to date, but we should have dismissed the possibility that it will happen.</p><p>And China has a lot of smart people, a big country. And so, I think we should operate on the assumption here in the United States that they will be successful, It's just a matter of when. And going back to Dennis's point, that really means that we need to get our own house in order. We need to invest in the areas where we have current strengths. And decide, what are the industries of the future? Where do we currently have advantages? And we should double down and invest in those.</p><p>And in terms of industrial policy here in the US, what does that look like? I think it doesn't mean the government picking winners, it doesn't mean creating standard enterprises, but it does mean boost the investment into education to have the workforce. It does mean increasing government investment to basic research. You know, if you look back to, say 1980, the US percentage of GDP invested into basic research is half as it was today.</p><p>And now, we're facing a far more competitive global environment. We don't necessarily have guaranteed success in these industries. And so, you know, Congress in particular, it needs to work with the administration to double fund into basic science to -- even applied science -- of places like DARPA, Department of Energy. There's some positive signals but nearly not enough in that space.</p><p>DALY: Thank you.</p><p>WILDER: OK. On the question of, you know, the United States going out to countries and saying we don't need to have the evidence, it's pretty obvious what the problem is here, I think, you've seen different reactions from different nations. The Australians and the New Zealanders seem to have accepted that argument. And they have gone to a ban.</p><p>The UK, Germany and others are looking at the economics of it, and saying, if we do this, we will set ourselves back, and we will not be economically competitive if we simply ban Chinese corporations from involvement. So their assessment of risk versus benefit is very different from that of some other countries. And it's going to be interesting, the British are right now, as you've seen in the \"Financial Times\", and other newspapers, trying to decide how they're going to come out on this. There is a report that's due sometime this spring. I'm not sure exactly when from the British government that will try and make a choice.</p><p>They're being leaned heavily upon by the United States. But they've had a lot of experience with Huawei equipment, and they are really thinking this through. So it's going to be interesting to see whether everybody buys this argument that, you know, there's obvious reason to keep Huawei out.</p><p>On a national industrial policy, I'm really glad Jimmy said what he said, because I'm not talking about a Chinese-style national industrial policy, but I am talking about incentives, money to basic research these kinds of things. And when we say, well the private sector can do it, my second home, my vacation home is in Chautauqua County, New York, the poorest county in the state.</p><p>You want to talk about rural cyber? Come to my county. Half the county doesn't have anything but dial-up service still. So the private sector is not doing a fantastic job in many rural areas of the United States on this. So I'm not so sure that leaving this all to the private sector is necessarily the answer to these questions.</p><p>We created the interstate highway system for a reason, and it was highly successful. I mean, General -- President Eisenhower did it because as a young soldier he took a road trip across the United States and realized that there were no good roads in the United States. I wonder in the cyber realm, whether we need to rethink again this aversion to industrial policies. And I'll leave it there.</p><p>DALY: OK. Thank you. Please raise your hand if you have a question and do wait for a microphone. Yes, right back there.</p><p>QUESTION: John Holden with McLarty Associates. During the Cold War, although it was cold comfort, we had something called mutually assured destruction, MAD. Is there anything analogous in the cyber sphere -- ? Is there at some point at which an action on one side will trigger something that it would ultimately be a disincentive for that actor?</p><p>DALY: This is about (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure really, cyber warfare. Dennis you want to take (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WILDER: Sure I actually was listening to former director Woolsey talk about this the other day. And I'll give you his point of view, and that is that the United States needs to demonstrate more fully our offensive cyber capabilities to the Chinese. That we need to be more upfront. That if we wanted to, we could do a lot to them. That, I guess, would be in your category of a declarative mutual assured destruction strategy.</p><p>John to be honest with you I haven't thought this question through. Sure enough mutually assured destruction strategies are pretty extreme, but certainly, I think, I guess what I'd say is, the Chinese need to think about this. We are capable of a lot. Without going into detail, there are several books you can read on what we've done in a certain foreign country that was quite dramatic in this regard.</p><p>You know, we have Cyber Command. We are developing offensive capabilities for use in wartime. So I think if the Chinese push us to this point, there may well be, at some point, a decision to go in that direction, but I haven't seen it yet.</p><p>DALY: You're talking about Stuxnet?</p><p>WILDER: I didn't say that word.</p><p>DALY: OK.</p><p>GOODRICH: Let me just add to that. I think, there's also the economic realm. If you think about the mutual interdependence itself should be deterrent towards greater bifurcation of the systems. And I think, as you see it, if you see an inability to contain the security concerns, you're going to see radar bifurcation, or splintering, as some say, of the global ICT infrastructure. And that would be devastating for both countries, given that, you know, if you look at the revenue model of any global tech company, China is critical for them.</p><p>And China today, and they have a very long road to go before they're completely independent, and they may never will be, so they need access to all these systems and components just like anyone else does. So the more they push on this front, the more that we push, the greater economic cost it's going to inflict on both countries.</p><p>And, you know, that in the past has also been and, another form of, deterrence towards some of the most unfavorable outcomes.</p><p>DALY: OK. Over here.</p><p>QUESTION: Yes. I'm Dr. Sam Hancock of EmeraldPlanet TV, and this goes to Dennis. Your statement about many of these rural areas. You know, there's about 48 million Americans that don't have access really to the Internet.</p><p>WILDER: Right.</p><p>QUESTION: 48 million, and actually in some ways it's growing. But also, if you look at the inner-city, you go to Ward 8 or Ward 7 here in Washington DC, you have some of the same things. So you have many inner cities, these lego cities, do not have, you know, the high-speed Internet. How do we bring this about?</p><p>And going to, you know, Jimmy's, your earlier comments on, you know, access and technologies and all that, how do we bring this to the people? And then are we avoiding using what's called TV white space that may be a way to easily and inexpensively bring this type of connectivity? But as we expand the technologies in this competitive world, we have to have all these people. These 48 million people are important to the economy and they're locked out.</p><p>DALY: Thank you. Maybe after Dennis's comments, also Naomi, is there anything you see that the public sector can do to incentivize the private sector to go into these areas that haven't been deemed profitable?</p><p>WILDER: Well, I hate to sound like some of the Democratic presidential candidates here, but I think there is a social economic divide in this country in terms of cyber. That is a real inequality that we don't look at. You know, I think many of us in the higher socioeconomic classes in this country simply assume that everybody has what we have and they don't.</p><p>And there are barriers based on price, and there are barriers that we've talked about based on infrastructure. This is why I really reject the notion that government doesn't have a role to play here. I think government has a big role to play, and we just need to find what that role is, because I agree, it is outrageous that that many Americans are not being brought into the 21st century right now.</p><p>WILSON: So in terms of incentives, I agree with what has been said thus far. That government does have a role in terms of incentivizing technological development and incentivizing students to be able to, and to choose the path of learning, of higher technology and engineering.</p><p>I will say I do think that the burden is on tech companies with respect to this specific problem set. And I say that because tech does not have the best reputation right now, and to the extent that tech can demonstrate that there is societal benefit, that they care about the rural communities, and those that are not as well served as the upper middle-class communities, I think that is to tech sector's advantage.</p><p>So I don't know if there's an incentive that the government can or should create in that area, but I absolutely see it as a worthwhile endeavor for the tech sector at large. They have the capability, and we need to start demonstrating more publicly that there is real societal benefit to these new technologies.</p><p>GOODRICH: And, I'll just add one point there. I think, you know, there are ways that we can, and we have actually been successful, in order to spur demand. You know, government policy is good when we can think about how do we get more people using the devices, the technology across a greater swathe of the economic spectrum. And in a way that's technology neutral, so that whichever way the government stimulates that demand it allows the private sector to fill the void.</p><p>One good example we have right now. Obviously, we could do better. Hence your example in New York is the Universal Service Fund. Where, you know, everyone pays a little in your cellphone tax. Your phone bill goes back to a fund that the FCC manages to help subsidize rural broadband development in communities. We also had an increase in that in the Stimulus Package in '08 as well, and that was during 4G and 3G deployment.</p><p>So, you know, obviously the scale isn't big enough if we still have a gap there, but that's one way government can actually help bring technology to impoverished communities, and that's -- in a way this technology neutral, we're not picking winners, it's simply stimulating the demand side and incentivizing these carriers to give the technology areas where there may not be that financial sense incentive to date.</p><p>One other thing is on a technology perspective. Actually 5G, in some ways, will help alleviate part of the problem in that it really gets the user off the fixed network, because the signal goes a lot further. It can go through a lot more buildings, get through a lot more robox-like mountains. And so, that technology also will bring improvements on that front.</p><p>DALY: And is it not also true that Huawei and other Chinese companies are offering to help bridge this gap, because they bring in lower-cost components for everything from the handsets to the routers and servers. This has been part of their pitch in Africa, and South America, and around the world, that they can actually do this at cost and fill the gap if they're permitted to.</p><p>WILDER: Yes, many small providers in the United States use Huawei equipment, because of the cost factor.</p><p>DALY: OK. Let me come right down front. Sir.</p><p>QUESTION: Chris (ph) McChrist (ph). So I wanted to build a bit little bit further, in that I mean, Americans are presumably seven or eight percent of the world's population, if we think about the five keys for human development, and if we go back to what the Christian (ph) (INAUDIBLE) himself was saying in November 2016. You know, what do countries like India, as well as China, as well as Africa, actually want from 5G? In some ways, Huawei, it's actually nearer the underground things like education, and health, and agriculture.</p><p>I mean, maybe the problem is different sectors, and I understand why some sectors are really confidential for Americans. But it'd be a terrible shame for the whole of the world, I think, if we get all of these things muddled up and don't realize that in some ways the distributed technology, as far as I understand it, a 5G, which Huawei in China's, you know, will massively done across huge continents, also is incredibly valuable for the future. So, I'd just like to know, how you see that side of things?</p><p>DALY: I think that the panel so far has been really careful to acknowledge this, and is really not to vilify Huawei's action globally. If anyone has anything else to add as well. As I said, anything to add on that?</p><p>WILDER: I think that in the third world, Huawei products and ZTE products are incredibly important at this point. We don't make handsets that are as cheap as what a Huawei or ZTE does. We don't make these things. So again, I think when we get back to this question of risk benefit. And from the point of view of many third world countries, the risk of having Huawei potentially cooperating with their government is less of a concern than getting these kinds of goods and services to their people.</p><p>And so, different countries are going to make different calculations on the risk-benefit scale.</p><p>DALY: If I just, a little pressure on that, when they begin -- some countries in considering making different calculations have heard threats from us that, if you cooperate, if you have Chinese systems, that that may limit cooperations of certain kinds with the United States. Does anybody want to comment on that as, sort of, a policy, or a pitch?</p><p>WILDER: Well, I think that that's most important in NATO, and with our allies, because the question at that point becomes, how do you share sensitive information over telecommunication systems, if you can't do that? Now, I will say there is another factor that somebody brought up to me the other day that I'm still working through in my own head. And that is allowing China influence over you. In other words, if you go Huawei, and then you do something with Taiwan that Beijing may not approve of, are you going to find that your supplies from Huawei are mysteriously delayed?</p><p>You know, there is the question of once you make this choice, have you put yourself in a position where you might be the subject of undue influence? Again, that's a hypothetical, but we certainly have seen Chinese economic sanctions against people who did things, particularly in relation to Taiwan, that they didn't like.</p><p>DALY: Thank you. Naomi.</p><p>WILSON: I'll just add on the intent versus capability side. So, from my perspective, this is another area where we have to be careful about making assumptions, and what that leads us to conclude. So, even if a Chinese -- if we accept the fact that a Chinese company may be directed by the Chinese government to do something, that does not mean in of itself that they have the capability to do that, and/or that it poses a threat and cannot be mitigated.</p><p>So those are all subsequent questions that we have to ask. To me, the -- can a company be influenced by a government, is a very political question. And there's nothing to stop any company, really, apart from standing on its principles, and its economic life, to stop a company from being influenced by any number of parties. Any company of any origin could be influenced by an entity that seeks to buy it off.</p><p>So just to say that, because a company could possibly be directed by a government, I think, is not sufficient in terms of what do we do about that from a policy perspective.</p><p>DALY: Go ahead. Microphone.</p><p>QUESTION: One argument I've heard is that Hawaii has a big advantage over most other competitors in 5G, a year or two, in fact, I've heard. Is that correct, or not just a factual question? Thank you.</p><p>GOODRICH: There's no doubt that Huawei is extremely competitive in telecommunications technology. It's the largest in terms of revenue, and they also now have the largest spent into research development surpassing their peers, particularly their European competitors.</p><p>So, and in many aspects, Huawei is looking to vertically integrate their technology ecosystem to be able to produce even some of their own chips. Now, they're not able to do everything they need, but some of those they're very competitive, or even more competitive than some of their competitors.</p><p>So I mean Huawei is absolutely a global giant and there's no sign that's going to change, in terms of you know, are they had or not? I think one interesting benchmark to look at again is R&amp;D and, if you're not able to reinvest to your profits back into research development, if you have to, you know, pay off debt loans, restructure your work force in other countries, those are the things that Huawei right now is not under pressure to do, unlike their other competitors.</p><p>And so, they've just have a lot more capital to spend, whether it's into their people or technology. And, unless that changes, it's going to be very difficult for their competitors to maintain their competitiveness with them. That being said, you know, it's not a one single winner takes all across the entire technology spectrum.</p><p>You know, as I mentioned before, 5G is really an ecosystem of technology, and there are areas in which each telecommunications hardware vendor does thing that others don't in terms of comparative advantage. And so, some of the European vendors are very strong and excel at the core network. These big, back-end data centers that process all the data from all the phones.</p><p>And the data, and that's something really traditionally the European vendors have had a lot of strength in, whereas a lot of the Chinese telecommunication vendor experience comes in the radio network, which are the base stations that send the signals out to the phones and other devices. And so, I think, there are omplementarity, advantages that each has, but Huawei still from a scale perspective, is surely ahead.</p><p>DALY: OK. Yes, sir. Here in the middle.</p><p>QUESTION: My name is Jose (ph) (INAUDIBLE) from -- I'm a graduate student at American University, and my question has to do with, regarding the conference in Barcelona that happened. We could go. Some press had characterize Huawei as the architect of the five-year infrastructure. So, given that fact, and as Dennis mentioned, the different standards that Chinese companies have and the Chinese government also has. And also, the different times that policy has regarding these technologies, like 5G, IOT, or AI.</p><p>Are democracies and market economies ready to deal with this competition? With having a competitor like China, are systems, are democratic institutions, ready to deal with these, kind of, technologies?</p><p>DALY: Who want to go first? You or (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>WILDER: I'll give it a shot. I think you asked a really excellent question that we're struggling with, as Jimmy was talking about, and I think it's an important point. One of the things that Huawei has is very deep pockets. They are able to access capital, and they are able to go into markets and bid very low, because they have essentially the backing of the Chinese government.</p><p>Our companies in democracies don't get that particular advantage, right? Our companies have to figure out how to do this on a economically efficient level. And I have -- when I was at the White House - and, you know, I would have American companies come to me and say, we can't compete in Africa. We come in with a bid and Huawei always underbids us. And they can do that, because they can take a loss that our stockholders aren't going to let us take, right?</p><p>If an American company were to go out and do a bunch of loss leaders in Africa think what happens to it. So there is this problem. There there's no question that there is a real difference between our economic systems and our political systems, that makes it hard in various markets to compete. And we haven't figured out that problem.</p><p>And so, I do think that that this is an enormous advantage for the Chinese companies. That said, I also think we still have enormous advantages in innovation, creativity that they don't have, because one of the things that happens when you have such deep pockets is your incentive to be efficient, and creative, and innovate is decreased. But, I'll let Jimmy finish that.</p><p>GOODRICH: Yes, I think that, you know, brings us to the broader question of, you know, in terms of competitiveness, having a fair market place is really critical for the success of the US companies. That's where we've thrived, and you know, it's a well-known fact that the Chinese government certainly provides a whole lot of capital that's non-market based to their companies.</p><p>And we need to do something to figure out what are the new rules going to be, because clearly the, you know, the World Trade Organization, the organization that governs a lot of these rules, particularly around subsidies, hasn't done its work that it should have, because we're here today, and none of that was ever really challenged or disputed in the WTO.</p><p>And that's because the current rules, where they sit, are really perspective, and that a country can actually challenge subsidies that were given to say to China's domestic telecom vendors. But you have to wait until you're harmed. And so, if you're already harmed here, it's basically a coroner's inquest. You're trying to reformations for damage that was done to you.</p><p>And so, right now actually, the United States is working with its allies. Right now, it's just Europe and Japan to try and rewrite those rules, because they don't want that to happen again. And we all share that common goal of trying to ensure that China -- they want these industries, but they have to ensure that they don't destroy them in the process of creating them.</p><p>And that's really, I think, ultimately, bad for innovation too. If you look at whether it's electric vehicles, or solar, or some lithium batteries, China is making huge government investments into these sectors. They might drive the cost down in terms of a commodity, but they also cut off the innovation, because they lead to a lowest common denominator of your product in terms of pricing.</p><p>And so, that really squeezes out an ability to invest into the future technologies, diverse technologies for different applications. So we've heard from -- talking to a panel of experts on solar technology, and saying actually, there's much better, more efficient, higher-powered solar panels out there, but because the market's been crowded out by cheaper imports from China, they can't compete against them.</p><p>So I think, ultimately, how do we change the rules, so this doesn't happen again. And thankfully, we're thinking about it, but it's still a long way to go.</p><p>DALY: Naomi, any final thoughts?</p><p>WILSON: I see right now different dynamics in the international system, and I think Jimmy is absolutely right. That there are certain rules within the WTO that are no longer functioning as they should, no longer necessarily applicable.</p><p>And to your point about democracies and market-oriented economies versus those that are more top-down, I do think we're at a point in time where the world economy is trying to reconcile those different systems. And we still do very much need agreed upon norms and rules of the road, but it's fairly obvious that the ones we're currently working off of our outdated.</p><p>DALY: Well, thank you and thanks to all of you for joining us. Please do stay tuned for Kissinger Institute, and the Wilson Center as a whole will be playing increasing attention to this question of security, espionage, commerce, tech with relation to US-China relations broadly, and we hope you will join us again soon.</p><p>Thank you to Dennis Wilder, and Naomi Wilson, and Jimmy Goodrich for your time today.</p><p>WILDER: Thanks.</p><p>GOODRICH: Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200005033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:563C-JV01-JCRM-B2RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13188\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Data Licensing, LLC.

During our one-hour interview on the balcony of his suite at the Palazzo Versace hotel along Dubai Creek, Ibrahim calls for a change in the incommensurate philanthropic culture among wealthy Muslims in the Gulf, blames GCC government's favourable policies for the \"laziness\" of Middle Eastern investors in Africa and argues there have been more commendable leaders in Africa than in the West in the past decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brazen or simply unwilling to rose-tint his opinions, the Sudanese businessman who founded African telecommunications company Celtel in 1998 is more than anyone else in the world holding African leaders to account. Since 2000, the annual Ibrahim Index of African Governance has provided the most comprehensive assessment of African governments' performances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additionally, the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is the richest prize in the world, worth $5m over 10 years and a $200,000 annual pension thereafter. It is awarded to former African leaders who have worked to improve their countries without corruption and who gracefully stepped down from office when they were expected to.</p><p>The prize is intended to not only inspire great leadership but to also stir up discussion among lay Africans. A lack of coherence across the continent has allowed serious issues to fester, including a lack of economic integration, extremism, the growth in lawless areas being overtaken by militias, the illicit flow of state money offshore and environmental degradation.</p><p>\"What we lack is strong, clear leadership in Africa, frankly,\" Ibrahim says. \"There was a time when we had strong voices in Africa, credible leaders, starting from (former Ghana president Kwame) Nkrumah, (Egypt's second president Gamal Abdel) Nasser and that era (1950s and '60s), and president (Julius Kambarage) Nyerere from Tanzania (1960-85); we had (former South African presidents Nelson) Mandela and [Thabo] Mbeki; we've had [former Nigerian president Olusegun] Obasanjo. We've had a number of people who are really strong and effective \u2026 who were really willing to look beyond their borders to a pan-African position and they were really well respected in Africa and outside Africa.</p><p>\"At the moment you look around and you have a lack of such political leadership.\"</p><p>Attempts by the African Union to form a stronger voice across all 54 African states have largely had little effect, he argues. Ibrahim was the lead author of an open letter to the union ahead of its annual meeting in January, in which business leaders and human rights activists said the group's active response to the crises in South Sudan and Burundi would be an ultimate indication of its effectiveness.</p><p>\"This is a grave test of AU credibility, and of the continent's ability to solve its own problems,\" they wrote.</p><p>Despite the pleas, the union voted against a UN-backed proposal to send in 5,000 peace keepers to Burundi, where President Pierre Nkurunziza is seeking a third term, and no decisive action has been taken on South Sudan.</p><p>\"I don't want to be too harsh because this is important for us \u2026 but we hope that the African Union will develop into a much more effective organisation, and we have a tall agenda,\" Ibrahim says.</p><p>In nine years, there have been only four recipients of Ibrahim's leadership award: the former president of Namibia, Hifikeypunye Pohamba (2014), Cape Verde's Pedro De Verona Rodrigues Pires (2011), Botswana's Festus Gontebanye Mogae (2008) and the former leader of Mozambique, Joaquim Alberto Chissano (2007), and one honorary award to former South African president, the late Nelson Mandela.</p><p>\"When we launched the prize, we made it clear that this is not a pension, it's not a birthright, it is a prize for excellence and excellence by its nature is rare, otherwise it would not have been excellence. And we will not shy away. We expect some year we will not find the right people to fill that,\" Ibrahim, who is not a member of the independent committee, says.</p><p>\"Imagine this was a European prize. Over the last 10 years, could you have found five European leaders who really provided us with that excellence in leadership? I think it's very difficult. In my mind, I can only find one: [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel.</p><p>\"This dearth of leadership is not just an African phenomenon, it's everywhere. Look at [Australia], every time I go to a meeting I meet a different prime minister. That's why the world is in a mess right now, because of a lack of leadership everywhere.\"</p><p>The index, which is based on 93 indicators, has revealed a stark correlation between economic prosperity and good governance. Progress was witnessed in the majority of African countries between 2000 and 2008, but once the global economy plunged, so did accountability among legislators, the index committee's analysis shows.</p><p>\"[The strong] commodity prices and the fast growth period we have seen over 10 years somehow eased political pressure to reform,\" Ibrahim says. \"Usually when the government feels they're able to buy their way out they become a little bit more lax in pushing development. The fact is, this growth in Africa in the last 10 years went to 0.1 percent \u2013 not even 1 percent \u2013 of the people. It just helped create an elite. Somehow issues of reform and improving governance were stalled. We should have really utilised the favourable economic situation to fire our economies, really build forward. I think many of our countries failed to do that and now we're going to pay the price for this.\"</p><p>However, Ibrahim remains optimistic. Belt tightening across the continent will inspire citizens to more carefully consider their governments' actions, he says. \"Don't forget the rise in civil society. Civil society in Africa is very important because, whatever people say about Africa, really there is great political space compared to people in the Middle East, for example,\" he says.</p><p>\"Most African countries are democratic to some extent. We have reasonable elections in well over 30 countries out of the 54, so the situation is not that bad really, and once you have an active civil society supported with all this social media, technologies, etcetera, it's very hard to put the lid back on.\"</p><p>Seventeen African countries are due to go to the polls this year. Ibrahim says it is \"difficult\" to predict how many elections will be held free and fairly, but there are some obvious countries of concern, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.</p><p>Even in Uganda, which has experienced robust economic growth, international observers have alleged corruption in last week's election, which saw incumbent president Yoweri Museveni extend his 30-year rule.</p><p>Ibrahim says he can understand the attraction to some of hanging onto executive power.</p><p>\"Suddenly you have private jets, you have motorcades, you have helicopters, you get driven everywhere, you have red carpets - it's a different kind of living \u2026 and this satisfies some people,\" he says.</p><p>Ibrahim himself has been described as the most powerful black man in the UK, where he has been based for decades. Slightly embarrassed, he refutes the suggestion.</p><p>\"I never thought, honestly, that I, myself, had any sort of power,\" he says. \"I queue wherever I go. In Britain, I'm called the most powerful black man [but] many times when I give my passport there, they look at me, they type something, they look at me and they type many things; all the other guys go straight away [but] because I have a funny name people wonder if I'm a Muslim terrorist or what, I don't know, but I always take longer.\"</p><p>Good governance is also, he argues, intricately linked to good business. Ibrahim refers to the recent court battles initiated by British and French governments to make Google cough up millions of dollars in alleged unpaid tax to illustrate his point.</p><p>\"We will start to realise that business can be a force for good, because business is not necessarily evil. Sometimes people do stupid things - in many cases, you'll find it's really the fault of governments who failed to legislate,\" he says.</p><p>\"Look at this big fuss about taxation. At the root of this really is the failure of governments to implement proper rules and to reach international agreements. Business [is] global; governments still work in solo - there's a total mismatch and that's a problem. That's why business make the best of this, they pick and choose where they pay taxes. What the business is doing is legal.\"</p><p>Ibrahim has taken the principles he preaches to governments and applied them to business. He is a founding member of The B Team, an organisation of private sector leaders including the likes of Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington and Blake Mycoskie, who are attempting to clean up the world of business. The B Team is particularly targeting corruption and money laundering, which it says \"are a drag on economies\", while advocating the benefits of prioritising people and the planet alongside profits.</p><p>Ibrahim also has been appointed to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a CEO-led organisation that promotes sustainable business.</p><p>It is an imperative issue for a continent that has been described by many as the next big place to be. Billions of dollars are being ploughed into many African states, from the US to China, making Africa the second most attractive investment destination globally, ranking just behind North America. A record $87bn of foreign direct investment (FDI) flowed into most of the region's 54 economies in 2014.</p><p>But Middle East investors have been noticeably quiet, accounting for less than 1 percent of FDI in Africa \u2013 and what money they do apply is typically in fellow Arab states in North Africa.</p><p>Ibrahim, who last year sealed a tie-up with private equity firm TPG to invest in Africa via his $500m private equity fund Satya Capital, says despite their geographical advantage and historic ties, Gulf investors have it too easy at home to be bothered with Africa.</p><p>\"They've had a very easy life here in the Middle East, where policies of governments are skewed to help them. When they go out there in the cold they have to compete against other people and probably they are a bit lazy,\" Ibrahim says. \"There's a great opportunity in Africa and the return on investment in Africa is wonderful. Our brothers here need to pull up their socks and show us what they can do.</p><p>\"Everyone [in the GCC] is excited about Iran now - that's, what, 60 million people; there is 1 billion people [in Africa]. It's really a great opportunity for people to invest but they have to deal with international rules.\"</p><p>He does, however, accept that there are multiple challenges to doing business in Africa, not least regulation. Child labour, women's rights, violence against women in the workplace and protection of the environment are other issues he is attempting to address.</p><p>Ibrahim made his estimated $1.1bn fortune selling Celtel to the Kuwaiti telecom now known as Zain in a landmark $3.4bn deal in 2005. (It was sold again to Bharti Airtel in 2010).</p><p>While the record pace at which Africa has adopted mobile phones and the internet has brought admirable advantages to its citizens, economically, politically and in education, Ibrahim accepts that it also has created a degree of inequality.</p><p>\"Clearly there's a divide,\" he says. \"It's not just a question of ownership of the handsets or access, because over 50 percent of people have access to it; there's a question of the bandwidth - you need enough bandwidth in order to speed up communication, be able to download, stuff like that. This is a problem.\"</p><p>In most cases, African governments either do not have available revenues to fund the latest communication technology, at least outside the capital, or the required infrastructure has not been prioritised. Ibrahim, who has invested in a social enterprise called O3b, which has launched multiple satellites about 8,000km above the Earth that have brought large bandwidth capabilities to remote areas, says global giants such as Google and Facebook need to take partial responsibility for developing the infrastructure that will ultimately boost their profits.</p><p>\"I think the big tech companies really have not played their role in that because it's intrinsic to their business. They were able to have a free ride in Europe and elsewhere because other telecom companies put the infrastructure [and] they came and put their layers on top of that. That's not the job in Africa,\" he says. \"When we entered mobile communication in Africa, we had to put our own infrastructure because there's no microwave - in developed countries you acquire that from the incumbent - the fixed line operator - and just overlay the mobility layer on top of that. In Africa we had to do it \u2026 but still we were successful. So this argument I'm always telling our friends at Microsoft, at Google, Facebook, whatever, you guys need to do something about this.\"</p><p>It is self-evident that Ibrahim is an advocate for equality. He may be among the wealthiest Arabs globally, but he is also one of the most generous. Having signed Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge, Ibrahim has promised to give away at least half of his wealth. And philanthropy is another target on the Ibrahim dart board. Or, more precisely, his disappointment in the lack of it in the Middle East.</p><p>\"I think we need \u2026 to change our culture in the region here. At the moment, philanthropy in this part of the world means you look after your cousin if he's not doing well or the children of your sister, and if you go beyond that then you build a mosque,\" he says.</p><p>\"Philanthropy really is helping people who you don't even know their names; you don't even know where they live. It's the ability to really think humanely about the wider humanity beyond your family, beyond your village, beyond your town, beyond your country. That is the state of mind people need really to develop.</p><p>\"It's a pity. As I understand Islam, Islam is really about generosity, whether material or emotional, about really being a good human being. While our friends in the region here are always proud of being good Muslims, I see more good Muslims actually in America and in Europe than in the region here. [They] are not Muslims but actually they're much better Muslims than our Muslims here, which is very sad. Look at what Germany is doing to the refugees, and look at many of the countries here and what they're doing to our own refugees and you have to wonder.</p><p>\"It's time for us to go back and think who we are here and what we're doing. We lived in this mess for such a long time that we think we are the best nation ever created and it's time really to question that and at least try to be.\"</p><p>We can only wonder what the world would be like if all countries were run by the likes of Ibrahim.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/55/167/68/145648137139.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/55/167/68/145648137139.jpg</url></p><p>Mo-Ibrahim.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBBUS-67039535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBBUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J5P-B701-JDJN-625H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 ArabianBusiness.com - ITP Digital Ltd.

It will upend our way of life, in some ways forever[4](MIT Technology Review)While each of these essays offers a different perspective, let's focus on the last two: Ugo Bardi's essay on Hyperspecialization and the technological responses described in the MIT Technology Review essay.As readers of the blog know, I've been differentiating between first-order and second-order effects:First order effects: every action has a consequence. Second order effects: every consequence has its own consequences.We can think of these as direct (first order) and indirect (second order) effects.The MIT Technology Review article focuses on direct effects,i.e. how to deploy technology to identify people with the virus, track their recent movements and who they might have exposed to the disease, tech-driven regulations that would limit the movements of infected (such as we see in China now), etc.Bardi's first-hand account from Northern Italy touches on an indirect effect:the profoundly negative impact of a hyperspecialized economy that is suddenly disrupted. </p><p>In this case, the specialization is tourism, but there are other examples, many driven by hyper-globalization.Specialization has long been central to capitalism's relentless drive to increase efficiencies and thus profits, and globalization has pushed specialization to extremes globally dominant corporations can arbitrage currencies, wages, political corruption and lax environmental standards in ways that localized competitors cannot.The net result is increasing reliance on one globally competitive industry for jobs, tax revenues, etc.--in essence, the modern-day equivalent of a monoculture plantation or single-industry factory town.When the plantation or factory closes, there's no economically diverse ecosystem to pick up the slack.If tourism doesn't rebound very quickly, all the local economies that became hyperspecialized to serve global tourism (enabled by low-cost airfares and credit cards) will be gutted.The second order effect of the pandemic will be the wrenching transformation of these local economies into a much broader economic ecosystem that will have to be moated from globalized competition. For example, grapes flown in from locales 3,000 miles away will be banned or heavily taxed so local grapes can compete.A great many inefficiencies have been sustained by hidebound, self-serving institutions and cartels which have moated their industries from competition.These include higher education, healthcare, the defense sector and the recent crop of Big Tech monopolies (Facebook, Google, et al.).A number of people have already noted that remote online classes have become the norm out of necessity, and this has revealed the incredible inefficiency of maintaining enormously costly campuses and bureaucracies for coursework that can be completed anywhere.I wrote an entire book outlining how a superior education could be delivered for 10% of the current cost (roughly $120,000 for a four-year state college diploma).(The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy[5])While the large research universities need students to physically be present to operate the machinery of experiments and research, the vast majority of undergraduate coursework does not require physical presence. In many lab settings, whatever physical presence is required could be drastically compressed in time or shifted to remote control of lab tools.The same transition will occur in Corporate America as managers accept that there are few absolutely essential reasons to demand workers squander huge amounts of time and money transporting themselves to centralized workplaces.The trend to remote work is not new, but it is now being accelerated past the point that hidebound managers will be able to demand a return to the inefficiencies of the former status quo.This shift to decentralized, networked remote work will have a devastating impact on the commercial office sector.A very large percentage of the already-excessive supply of office space will be surplus, and it won't be cheap or easy to transform offices into residential living spaces.(An entire floor of office space might have one set of bathrooms and a single utility kitchen; every living unit will of course require its own bathroom and kitchen.)The financial fragilities and vulnerabilities that are now becoming apparent are not limited to hyperspecialization and globalized monoculture economies.The cost structure of most small enterprises was burdensome even in the best of times: rent, utilities, fees, taxes, regulatory compliance, insurance, labor overhead and so on are now crushingly costly, and once revenues decline by even modest amounts, the small businesses are no longer viable.Costs such as rent, healthcare insurance, local fees and taxes are notoriously \"sticky,\"meaning the default setting is to ratchet ever higher. These costs don't drop unless there is a full-blown crisis such as mass bankruptcies of commercial landlords and cities.Thus we can anticipate a culling of all the marginal, struggling small businesses in the pandemic recession, and a weak or non-existent emergence of new businesses in the future to replace those lost, as revenues will remain weak while costs will only increase.Few observers are pondering the psychological changes that the pandemic have unleashed.To take an obvious example, consumers will no longer be able to maintain confidence in their incomes or the market value of their labor and assets. This uncertainty will naturally encourage savings rather than frivolous spending and debt, and this change will depress consumption.Status quo policies such as lowering interest rates will not change this psychological shift in the tides.Lowering interest rates to zero won't mean credit cards, auto loans and mortgages will be interest free, and lower rates won't change the reality that incomes and asset prices may decline or remain uncertain for years to come.The world has changed, and the only things we know with certainty are 1) a return to the pre-pandemic status quo is not possible and 2) this is a positive development.Put another way: eras end.No matter how glorious or inglorious they may have been, eras end and a new era begins.

On Wednesday, the European Union fined Alphabet subsidiary Google $1.7 billion for abusing its dominant position in online search advertising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turkey's competition board is investigating Google's search market dominance. </p><p>A UK competition panel found that Big Tech has gotten too big, and the country's antitrust regulator said it would investigate the online advertising market. </p><p>US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon. US prosecutors are reportedly conducting a criminal investigation into Facebook's data sharing deals. And President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that social networks should be investigated for anti-conservative bias.</p><p>The public's commitment to Big Tech's platforms has been tested, and a vocal minority is questioning whether these companies are forces for good. People are turned off by Facebook's inability to stop data breaches and Russian misinformation campaigns, rampant abuse and hate speech on Twitter, terrorism recruitment videos on YouTube and conspiracy literature on Amazon. Last week, the attack on two mosques in New Zealand was livestreamed on Facebook and reposted on YouTube.</p><p>Tech faces serious threats to its business. Companies could be broken up. People could flee the services. Silicon Valley has survived previous bouts with antitrust regulators in the past. But its bad behavior and inability to control the content on its various platforms might have reached a turning point. There's a big difference between restricting internet browser choice --- as governments have sued Google and Microsoft for in years past --- and social networks providing an unpoliced platform for terrorists. </p><p>Changing the tech industry from within won't be easy. Mark Zuckerberg and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have a stranglehold on their companies by giving their shares more votes than other stockholders. Snap and several other tech companies have similar stock structures that give their founders massive, unchecked power. Lyft, which will soon sell public stock for the first time, will be organized in a similar way.</p><p>But if tech companies want to retain control of their messaging, image, brand --- and makeup of their business --- they need to get serious about change. </p><p>Twitter took what could become one of tech's most innovative steps: The company this week unveiled a new test app that serves as a playground for Twitter to experiment with new features. So far, the experiments aren't that radical: Redesigned tweet threads, colors and buttons. Only iPhone customers can test the app, and it's by invitation only.</p><p>But the new app, named \"twttr,\" after the company's original name, could become the place where Twitter tests ways to solve its myriad problems. The company has been unable to overcome abuse on its platform, and dramatically changing the way its app works may prove the only solution to get ahead of the issue.</p><p>That's the tactic Facebook might take. Facebook announced last week it would reposition its business as a \"privacy-focused\" platform. In a blog post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook wants to build \"the digital equivalent of the living room\" by increasing the amount of encrypted, private messaging on its platform.</p><p>That kind of radical strategic reimagining is what Silicon Valley needs. Whether Big Tech will deliver on those changes remains to be seen. Tech has a long history of upstarts disrupting big, entrenched businesses. But the list of companies that successfully reinvented themselves is very short.</p><p>Tech companies might not have long to adapt. As General Motors CEO Mary Barra said about the massive changes coming to the auto industry in the next few years, \"Time is not our friend,\" in an interview with CNN Business last month. Barra laid off tens of thousands of workers and shifted the company's resources to electric vehicles, SUVs and self-driving cars to ensure GM doesn't fall behind. It continues to be a painful, unpopular and expensive decision, but it could ensure GM has a future in the age of Uber and driverless vehicles.</p><p>If the tech industry wants to survive this wave of regulation and public outrage, it will have to take bold action to fix its mistakes.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

One of Silicon Valley's most high-profile entrepreneurs, the 41-year-old founder and chief executive of both the microblogging service Twitter and the payments company Square is not one for personal chit chat. Perhaps running two companies does not give him the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a public event in London earlier this month, Dorsey was asked a series of quick-fire, light-hearted questions by his interlocutor. \"Savoury or sweet?\" - that sort of thing. Nothing controversial, but Dorsey declines to be put on the spot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Both,\" Dorsey says in response to the question about his culinary tastes. The interviewer tries again: \"Cats or dogs?\" Once again, Dorsey responds \"both\", before eventually saying that he keeps chinchillas.</p><p>Dorsey is best known for founding Twitter 12 years ago. In March 2006 he published the first tweet (\"just setting up my twttr\"), before leaving the company under a cloud two years later, and returning as chief executive in 2015. One wonders if, given the company's growth since then, Dorsey wishes the first tweet had been more profound.</p><p>It's not a question he is prepared to answer though, because on this occasion Twitter is another subject Dorsey declines to take questions on.</p><p>While peculiar for a chief executive to deflect questions about his own company, it is one of the dilemmas of Dorsey's dual identity. Twitter is off limits because he is in the UK to promote his other entity, Square. After Dorsey left the microblogging service, he struck up an idea with Jim McKelvey, a software entrepreneur who had run a firm in Dorsey's home town of St Louis, Missouri, where Dorsey had interned as a 15-year-old.</p><p>McKelvey's career had taken an unconventional step into glass blowing, but he was frustrated at his business being unable to accept credit cards. Two years earlier the iPhone had just launched, but small businesses still need bulky equipment to take card payments. Dorsey and McKelvey hacked together a scanner that plugged into a smartphone's headphone jack, and converted its information into an audio signal that could be decoded by an app. Square was launched in 2010 as a way for small businesses to take credit card payments using a smartphone or tablet. It takes a 1.75pc fee on transactions, while its software lets businesses manage their finances. In the US, it also offers loans to small businesses that are then paid back by taking a cut of sales, as well as an app for consumers that lets them send money back and forth. Last year it launched its credit card reader in the UK, although other parts of the business are US-only.</p><p>Dorsey has been chief executive since, even after taking the reins at Twitter for a second time three years ago. The dual roles have led to tension, most notably in 2015 when Twitter's board demanded he step down from running Square if he wanted the job. Dorsey refused to budge, and Twitter's directors eventually buckled.</p><p>The decision seems to have worked out, though. Under Dorsey Twitter's shares have arrested a lengthy decline since its 2013 flotation. Square, which went public in November 2015, has quadrupled in value since then. For a brief moment in November, its market value surpassed that of Twitter. Today it hovers close to it, worth $18.8bn (\u00a313.3bn) compared to Twitter's $21.4bn. Most of Dorsey's own $3.7bn net worth comes from Square, in which he holds a 15pc stake.</p><p>Not that financial gain appears to be Dorsey's main priority. In fact, he ascribes Square's success to taking a different approach to established financial companies, such as banks and payment handling firms. \"A lot of the institutions we came across [when starting Square] were optimising profit versus scale,\" he says.</p><p>\"We decided that we would include as many people as possible, so we took on a different mindset.\"</p><p>If profit is not the goal, what is? \"Our purpose is economic empowerment,\" Dorsey says. \"We saw the financial industry of the past exclude a lot of people, not necessarily intentionally but because they weren't using technology in the right way, they weren't using modern systems and we saw a real opportunity to solve a real problem.\"</p><p>He says when Square started only 30pc of businesses in the US that applied to accept credit cards were accepted. His company's figure was 99pc, because it was willing to take on more risk. \"It's just a very different mindset and we had the technology to back it up.\"</p><p>Dorsey is a clear introvert. He rarely gets animated when speaking, seemingly placing a lot more importance on the words he says than the way in which they are delivered. He is almost always dressed in black.</p><p>Twitter Dorsey's But it would be a mistake to interpret that as evidence of a lack of enthusiasm. Dorsey is known as a compulsive self-improver - his daily routine involves waking early, meditating and walking the five miles to Twitter's San Francisco office listening to a podcast before spending the afternoon at Square, whose office is across the street.</p><p>$Value of firm One of his current obsessions is Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, a topic that many other financial industry executives have dismissed, and which institutions have distanced themselves from. Last year Square allowed users of its money transfer app to buy up to $10,000 in Bitcoin a week. The service does not exist in the UK, although Dorsey adds a telling \"yet\". And while the move may have been seen as a cheap $Bitcoin' allowed buy attempt to cash in on the surge in Bitcoin's price last year, Dorsey insists otherwise.</p><p>\"I believe we're the first public company to offer Bitcoin. It's technology that will definitely change our industry and we believe that we will help change it for the positive. Instead of waiting for things to happen to us we wanted to help make them happen.\"</p><p>His other company, Twitter, banned cryptocurrency adverts last week, but Dorsey is far from modest in his expectations for Bitcoin.</p><p>He says finance is one of the few areas that remain controlled by a handful of institutions, and that the cryptocurrency, which runs on a \"decentralised\" network of computers rather than a handful of administrators, will change that.</p><p>\"I do believe that the world will utilise a global currency and I think the world will utilise one that is decentralised,\" he says.</p><p>\"The internet, which represents this unbridled communication network that the whole world can utilise at the same time, is going to require a currency and it likely will be Bitcoin.\" It's the sort of statement you are more likely to see on an anarchist's internet forum than from a billionaire. Is there a streak of that in Dorsey? \"I think there's a sometimes healthy and sometimes unhealthy distrust of every institution,\" he says. It has been a decade since the world fell out of love with financial institutions. The story of 2018 is that the same is happening to big tech companies, as regulators grow concerned over the influence they have on the information we consume, the data they hold and their effects on our minds.</p><p>launched with first tweet \"I think we should always have questions about anything that we utilise more, or anything that we become dependent upon,\" Dorsey says, and one senses that he's talking about the technology industry itself here more than just Square. Dorsey says he is not worried about the threat of regulation for tech companies. \"Our role is to help educate regulators around why or how a technology can help and to be very clear when it can't.</p><p>18.8bn payments Square \"In Square's case, we see our job as constantly having to educate banking regulators around what this technology can do.\" \"  Even with a growing backlash against tech companies, Wall Street can still be a bigger enemy, but Dorsey says Silicon Valley has to change too, becoming more democratic and transparent about the decisions it takes. \"I think as an industry we probably haven't been great at being that open in the past,\" he says. \"But I'm excited and optimistic that10,000 Square users to week everything is changing towards the positive.\"</p><p>CV</p><p>Age: 41</p><p>Education: left New York University after one year</p><p>Lives: San Francisco</p><p>Career: Twitter CEO: 2006-2008, 2015-present.

But it needs more muscle and money</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE GLASS and metal headquarters of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN's health agency, contrast starkly with their bucolic surroundings in the hills around Geneva. The only dabs of colour are the flags of its 194 member-states. For now the American flag still flutters beside the rest. But if President Donald Trump has his way, by July 2021 it will be gone. America is the WHO's biggest donor. A tenth of its staff are American. Its influence runs through the agency, right down to the peanut-butter cups in the staff vending machine. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is an odd time to cut ties with the world's foremost public-health body. There is a pandemic going on. Mara Pillinger, a health-policy researcher at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, says the WHO has done a \"pretty remarkable job\" of coping with covid-19, given the constraints built into the way it works. Nonetheless, the twin threats of Trumpism and coronavirus have illuminated both the agency's strengths and its weaknesses, and raised questions about its future.</p><p>The WHO's emergency work is governed by a legal framework known as the International Health Regulations, the current version of which has been in force since 2005. They spell out how public-health emergencies should be handled. They set the rules for how nations should behave. And they constrain the WHO. Member-states are bound to report outbreaks of diseases as soon as they can, but if they fail to do so, or delay as China did with covid-19, the organisation has no way of compelling them.</p><p>Before 2005 the rules were different. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who led the WHO from 1998 to 2003, slammed China for failing to report an outbreak of SARS promptly in 2003. Those days are gone, she says; member-states have now limited what the head of the WHO can do and say. Tedros Adhanom, the current director-general, has not openly criticised China. But nor has he lambasted America, points out Jeremy Hunt, a former British health secretary. Such tact is crucial. UN bodies work by consensus, he says: \"That is the price you pay for getting all the countries in the world around the table.\"</p><p>Ordinarily the job of the WHO is to identify the best public-health measures, share that information and offer technical support to members that need it. It is the main forum where countries co-operate on matters of health. The practical work of public health is not its job. However, when others fail it will step in. It has provided mental-health services in Syria and airlifted ambulances into Iraq. It failed in its response to an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 which killed more than 11,000 people. But when the disease struck the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018 it played a leading role in bringing it under control. When others thought it too dangerous to send staff into the field, the WHO stayed. Two staff were killed by rebels, who often attacked clinics. Dr Tedros visited Congo 14 times, showing unusual pluck for someone in his position.</p><p>The WHO was central in the eradication of smallpox, a disease killed almost 300m people in the 20th century. It has helped almost wipe out polio, which in the 1980s paralysed 350,000 people in 125 countries each year. The disease is now found in only three countries. The WHO receives information from countries on outbreaks, organises vaccination programmes and often acts as a kind of vaccine-approval agency. </p><p>One problem for the WHO, argues Dr Pillinger, is that much of its work is invisible. It co-operates closely with governments and lets them take credit for its efforts. When things go wrong, of course, it makes a convenient scapegoat, as Mr Trump has realised.</p><p>Its response to covid-19 has come under intense scrutiny, as it should. Dr Brundtland thinks the WHO declared the outbreak a public-health emergency far too late. That could be because China, once again, withheld information about a novel outbreak. It was, she says, \"concealing and waiting and shouldn't have done, according to International Health Regulations\".</p><p>Some say the WHO was too slow to issue guidance on the use of dexamethasone, a drug that can treat some of the sickest patients. Others have blasted it for dragging its feet before promoting the wearing of fabric masks on buses and in shops. Initially it did not have the evidence on which to base such guidance, explains Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist. It needed to know whether masks would be available and what the science said about the efficacy of the widespread use of the fabric kind. It asked researchers at Stanford University to investigate. On the basis of their research in June it changed its advice to say that such masks should be worn in public where physical distancing is impossible. </p><p>But overall the organisation has responded to covid-19 swiftly. At the start of the outbreak officials worked with technology and social-media companies to encourage them to promote accurate information. It coined the phrase \"infodemic\" to describe the rapid spread of misinformation about the new virus.  </p><p>It has helped co-ordinate global efforts to find treatments and vaccines. It is working with drug firms to safeguard the supply of medicines. It is now a key player in COVAX, a plan to distribute 2bn doses of a covid-19 vaccine in 2021. The WHO has rushed to digest research produced at high speed and explain what it means. Behind the scenes member-states are regularly told where the WHO thinks their measures are not aggressive or comprehensive enough. </p><p>Its efforts will be further analysed. In May the World Health Assembly, the WHO's decision-making forum, requested a full independent evaluation of the agency's response to the pandemic as well as that of individual countries. It will be published next year. Whatever its conclusions, many of the WHO's weaknesses are already apparent. Last month officials in the German and French health ministries circulated a paper saying the agency is severely underfunded, chronically over-mandated by member-states, and weak by design. </p><p>Money is the most immediate problem. The WHO's budget is a piddling $2.5bn a year (roughly what America spends on health care for a typical small city). \"It's a sad figure,\" says Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health and a former assistant secretary for health in the Obama administration. With this \"we expect them to solve the world's pandemics.\" In emergencies the WHO often has to go cap in hand to its funders to scrounge more cash. In the middle of the Ebola outbreak in Congo in 2018-19 it ran out.  </p><p>Its work is made harder because only 20% of its $2.5bn in funding is guaranteed and comes without strings. Much of that comes from a small number of large donors (see chart). It is like an oil-dependent country, argues Dr Tedros, too reliant on a single source of income, namely America. Other big countries, such as China and France, contribute trifling amounts. The other 80% comes in the form of around 3,000 unpredictable and voluntary contributions earmarked for specific projects. Almost half are for less than $500,000. They are messy, difficult to manage and fragment the organisation, says the WHO's boss. </p><p>Since he took over in 2017, Dr Tedros has tried to secure the agency's finances. He set up the WHO Foundation to create a more reliable source of money. He is trying to persuade member-states to give more unconditional funding. Even before the pandemic he had pushed health up the political agenda. Staff at a big health charity say that under him the WHO has gone from discussing its work with health ministers to talking to heads of state.</p><p>Dr Tedros credits his staff for feeding him good ideas, such as setting up a WHO Academy to support the training of health workers around the world. He established the role of chief scientist. He has reached out to the private sector, something the WHO has hesitated to do before, for fear of conflicts of interest. He says he is willing to work with the food industry to eliminate trans fat, a particularly unhealthy type of fat, from food by 2023. The agency is looking into working with big tech firms on digital health technologies. </p><p>Dr Tedros is the first director-general to be elected by a secret ballot of all member-states\u2014giving him greater independence, he says. A smaller group of countries, the WHO's executive board, used to control these elections. The reforms he has implemented so far have been ambitious, but member-states must push them further.</p><p>Beyond pandemics, the work of promoting science-based policy, strengthening health systems and expanding access to care is not glamorous. But it is vital. The agency's record on covid-19 is far from perfect but it had long warned of the possibility of a pandemic on such a scale. In 2018 it talked about \"Disease X\", an illness caused by a pathogen never seen before in humans that would cause the next pandemic and wreak havoc. Dr Tedros set up a new division to prepare for it. Many countries did not listen. </p><p>The world has no better idea than it did a year ago whether an outbreak as bad as covid-19 is a once-in-a-century event or will happen again tomorrow. Meanwhile, new demands on the WHO are emerging. A fresh outbreak of Ebola in Congo requires attention. Poorer countries will need support dealing with covid-19 along with existing diseases such as diabetes and measles. The WHO will have to spread its already limited resources even more thinly.</p><p>Dr Tedros has tried to convince the Trump administration that America should stay part of the WHO but says it set \"completely unacceptable\" conditions for doing so (he did not specify what they were). Joe Biden has promised that America would rejoin the WHO immediately, should he win the presidency. Either way, the possibility of the organisation's main donor bunking out has made other countries realise that they should do more to bolster it. An internal panel is looking at reforms to the International Health Regulations. The WHO may need the power to investigate outbreaks more independently and to establish a system so that it can issue warnings about public-health emergencies earlier. A year ago the risks of a weak global health system were hard to calculate. Today the costs of failure are measured in trillions of dollars and the loss so far of around 900,000 lives to covid-19. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-V48OQ4D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T9-2341-JBKN-B01C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Brad Smith (BS): I don't have a view on whether he should be pardoned solely because I don't have knowledge of all of the facts. But I do think we have to acknowledge in the technology sector that he helped bring to light a lot of facts of which we were unaware. And I think the world is a better place because of those disclosures.</p><p>AW: Do you think the Irish government was right to appeal the recent (EURO)13bn Apple tax ruling from the European Commission? BS: I don't have a stake in the ground here or an opinion to offer on the specifics of the case. But I'd step back and say the world needs a globalised effort to harmonise tax laws. We do need a 21st century approach to taxation that countries around the world can feel comfortable with. I think it needs to start with the United States. The US really stands alone among the major developed countries with a tax system that is not territorial in nature. I think that injects an anomaly into the international tax regime. We need governments to come together with a new multilateral initiative. I think that can probably only happen if the US starts to move forward.</p><p>AW: Many US company executives and legislators say that this is overtly political and an attempt by European authorities to grab US taxes. What do you think? BS: One should step back. Every time the European Commission makes a decision or regulates the tech sector, there are people in the US that sometimes read into it some kind of particular attitude toward American companies.</p><p>But I think one is better served by recognising a couple of things. Look, the industry's leaders today are basically either American or, in some cases, Chinese. So of course there's going to be a bigger impact on American companies because the industry reflects that.</p><p>People often ask me, on the privacy issue, 'do you think the European Commission or governments are acting on privacy solely because all of this technology is coming from American companies?' And my answer is always 'no', European governments have been acting at the forefront of privacy protection since 1945.</p><p>They've done this through progressive eras of technology and I just think that the importance of privacy is undeniable. The importance of tax treatment is undeniable. I think what we need are solutions that work across borders but that pay appropriate respect to different values across Europe and around the world. And I'm actually optimistic that if we set aside speculation about what motivates people. Or about what serves people best, we can actually start to hammer out some concrete steps.</p><p>AW: Regarding your recent (EURO)23bn acquisition of Linkedin, Salesforce are lobbying the European Commission to intervene on anti-competitive grounds. Are you worried about this? BS: By definition, regulators need to approve the merger. We recognised that it couldn't close until three governments approved it. Two of those three, the Americans and the Canadians, have cleared it to close. And we have been engaged in a very healthy conversation with the European Commission. They ask lots of questions as they always do and as they always should. I think they have good questions. I think we have good and clear answers to their questions. From my perspective this is an acquisition they is going to promote competition.</p><p>If one wants to look at the CRM market, obviously if Salesforce thought that, as the largest CRM provider, it could buy LinkedIn, as it obviously did, I have to believe that as the fourth largest CRM provider, we can buy LinkedIn. So I look forward to the continuing conversation and I remain strongly of the view that it will bring more competition to the marketplace.</p><p>AW: Salesforce executives have repeatedly warned that Microsoft will cut off critical data from LinkedIn to competitors. Could this happen? BS: It is not something that we have any intention of doing. The LinkedIn data is public today and we want to make that data useful in lots of new ways. So the European Commission has naturally been reviewing with us the whole range of issues and I think we have good plans and procompetitive plans at that.\"</p><p>AW: You have extensive operations in the UK. Is the prospect of hard Brexit affecting Microsoft's disposition towards the UK? BS: Not at this point. We have committed to two data centres in the UK. So we'll have Ireland, Amsterdam and then the UK, France and Germany. The UK's an important country. At some level it's even interesting to look at the UK and Ireland together. Both Dublin and London have grown so much and have become such important cosmopolitan centres. We very much hope that the UK will continue to thrive. I hope that we'll continue to be able to bring to the UK talent from across Europe and from around the world.</p><p>AW: But the UK Prime Minister is talking about pulling that country out of the European single market.</p><p>BS: We will simply have to follow what goes on there. We'll have to adapt. I think from my own perspective, the single most important factor will be the ability to bring some of the world's most important talent to come work in the United Kingdom.</p><p>AW: But how can you do that if the British government cuts down on immigration? BS: Well that's why I'm not the prime minister of the UK! But when I look at our research facility at Cambridge, for example, it has incredibly talented people from around the world.</p><p>AW: So you're not concerned? BS: I think it's too early to be concerned and it's too early to be sanguine. I think the issues are too important and we'll have to see how it unfolds.</p><p>AW: Do you think the case involving the US government (ordering you to give up email information from your data centre in Ireland) is over? BS: I feel very optimistic that decision of the second circuit court will prevail.</p><p>AW: Did the Irish Government's intervention (with an amicus brief) have a significant impact? BS: I think it did. It was very important in making clear that this is an issue that affects governments on the other side of the Atlantic. When I think of all the other groups that filed amicus briefs, the Irish Government is at the top of the list in terms of importance.</p><p>AW: As a big tech multinational company that has been in Ireland a long time, were you reassured by the Irish Government's response in moving to support Apple's position in the recent (EURO)13bn European tax case? BS: I'm not going to offer a view on that specific decision. But what continues to impress me in Ireland today is what has impressed me in Ireland for 25 years. This is a government that understands what is required to grow.</p><p>And it's a government that believes in investing in talent. And it's a government that believes in working with the private sector in creative ways.</p><p>I remember when I first moved to Redmond [Washington, Microsoft headquarters] in the late '90s.</p><p>That was a point in time when the Irish government was probably the first government to recognise that although it had created a tech sector based on CD and DVD manufacturing, the future was going to be about data and data centres.</p><p>A delegation from the Department of Enterprise came to visit us in Redmond. They asked us to build our first data centre in Ireland to serve Europe. We said we'd love to, but it wasn't feasible because there was no broadband cable that connected Ireland with the continent. So they said 'will you give us three months?' We said 'of course'. And in less than three months they had hammered out an agreement with the then Global Crossing and the cable was laid months later. So now there's a big [Microsoft] data centre here in Ireland.</p><p>To me what the speaks to is not any single issue but a broad approach. This is a government that gets it in terms of technology and talent and how they need to come together and that's what actually gives me the greatest source of confidence.</p><p>AW: Has Microsoft made any progress in the hiring and participation of female engineers and employees? BS: I think we have some progress behind us but we have way more progress ahead of us. I think Satya [Nadella, Microsoft ceo] has really brought a broad and deep focus across the company. I think that there are some areas where we're starting to see movement in the demographics. And I do share the sense that if, at the end of the day, if you don't see improvement in the numbers, then you should assume that you're not actually seeing a lot of improvement.</p><p>So we're starting to see improvement. I'm very optimistic in what I think we will be able to accomplish in the next few years. I do think it's a multi-year clause that we need to pursue.</p><p>AW: Is it a pipeline issue? BS: I would say two things. Yes, of course there are pipeline issues. But one should never assume that the pipeline needs to define your performance. I believe that a company can outperform the pipeline if it acts with real determination. I think our goal as a company should absolutely be to outperform the pipeline. And also we need a second goal, which we're pursuing, to invest with everybody else in strengthening the pipeline.</p><p>And when one is talking about women, this really is fundamentally thinking about how we start with girls early in school. It's about how we make computational thinking and computer science more interesting. It's about how we make it more broadly appealing to groups of people.</p><p>I think the bottom line from my perspective is very straightforward. We are moving forward but we need to move a lot farther and this is one of the real issues and causes of our time. We need to continue to embrace it that way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-117865994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KW6-J141-JBVM-Y4N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 6, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001290</classCode><className>PARDONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzhDNTg3RDgwRkVENDdEMDg5QjcyRTdBQzI1NEFFMDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTFGRjg4NjA3RTg1NDA2RkIzMDk4QzdGREIyQzVGMDk</classCode><className>Clemency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

These can be countered through smart, adaptive leadership, but this will require a new approach to policymaking and a willingness and commitment to collaborate across stakeholders that has lately been too rare in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why does the polarization of American society and the backlash against Big Tech occur at the same time that other countries are seeing similar societal shake-ups?</p><p>I believe all these events are driven by the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution,\" a phenomenon of wide-ranging disruption tearing through business models, economic and social systems, and labor markets. Technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain, gene editing, autonomous vehicles and robotics are combining in unprecedented and sometimes frightening ways. Science fiction is becoming reality.</p><p>Yet there is no natural law saying we must be alienated from our inventions. Technologies and their systems reflect the context in which they were created, as well as the purpose for which they were designed. It's therefore critical we don't focus simply on the technologies themselves, but also on the incentives and assumptions of the economic, social and political systems influencing their development.</p><p>To responsibly embrace the prospects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we need permanent interaction between governments and regulatory agencies on the one hand, and business on the other. We call this interaction agile governance, and to facilitate it, we opened our Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco this year.</p><p>The second big challenge for global politics and economics is the transformation of a unipolar global governance system, led by the United States, into a multipolar one, with several countries each asserting influence. It is a world where international relations may no longer be based on shared values, and where it is all the more imperative to develop and promote rules for global and regional interaction based on shared interests.</p><p>It is natural that in such a world, individuals and nation states want to primarily act in their own self-interest. The \"America First\" doctrine is a case in point. Nevertheless, we are globally interdependent, and there are global challenges, such as terrorism and climate change, for which we have to find solutions in our common interest.</p><p>The World Economic Forum is usually associated with globalization and sees its positive potential for humanity. Societies today are globally interconnected and need globalization -- but we need a new type of globalization. Trade and investment engagement should not be driven by a pure focus on reducing impediments, and economic gains should serve to protect those who are losing out. In some way, we need to save globalization from its negative consequences.</p><p>The idea that leveling the global playing field for trade and investment would generate prosperity for all has lost all credibility, particularly in the aftermath of the  financial crisis.</p><p>Every society requires a tailored global policy approach depending on its political, economic and social situation. We need to be committed to pursuing smart globalization, not the kind of \"hyperglobalization\" where national interests are subordinated to the imperative of creating a  borderless society at all costs. The priority today must be to reestablish trust through rebuilding social cohesion. If we cannot do this, and establish a sense of belonging and purpose, we will see democratic systems replaced with authoritarian power structures.</p><p>At the World Economic Forum's meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January, we will be committed to creating shared solutions for this fractured world. Agile governance and smart globalization are totally new paradigms for a fast-moving, complex world that requires global collaboration and local responses. The world is fast changing, and leaders have to find ways to create new positive narratives that motivate people to embrace change.</p><p>Klaus Schwab is the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-96092561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R6M-4PT1-DYRR-93P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc.

From the anchoring role in society of the middle class to the agility and resilience of mid-size firms, the middle was seen as consistent with both individual and collective wellbeing. Yet, in recent years, the middle has become less stable, less predictable, and more elusive, and its primacy-in economics, politics, business, asset management, and even sports-has become increasingly unsustainable. Driven by structural changes, as well as lagging business and policy responses, the middle has been eroded -or is at risk-almost everywhere you look. </p><p>Should this trend continue-which is subject to some debate-the implications would be far-reaching. For decades, a rising median household income in advanced economies anchored the growth of a middle class that often opted for the political centre. Together with stable and trusted institutions, the middle class acted as a stabiliser for a more prosperous society. In business, too, an environment in which mid-size firms flourished was viewed as desirable, because it reconciled small firms' lack of balance-sheet strength with their larger counterparts' tendency to slip into oligopolistic complacency. But median incomes have stagnated, which, combined with the impact of technology and insufficient policy attention to the potential distributional effects of unfettered globalisation, has gradually hollowed out the middle class around the world.</p><p>As a result, both the hope and reality of a satisfying middle-class life, with its potential for upward social mobility, are in decline. In addition to weakening an important social stabilising force, the diminution of the middle class has fuelled the politics of anger and undermined the political centre, hitherto dominated by established parties. As polarisation and fragmentation have increased, bipartisan policies have become a lot more difficult to pursue. This trend is also reflected in declining public trust in expert opinion and established institutions. And, all this has supported the growth of more extreme political parties and/or anti-establishment movements. The middle is also proving less friendly and stable for business. In sector after sector, mid-size companies face greater competition from small disruptors and/or their large counterparts. This includes the financial sector, where higher regulatory and compliance costs have eaten away at the sustainability of mid-size providers. This is visible in the number of mergers among mid-size asset managers that lack a strong corporate parent. Sports, too, is losing its middle. In the absence of forced equalisation mechanisms (such as those used in the United States' National Football League), European soccer is now dominated by a handful of teams that have become business behemoths. This last example also sheds light on important questions concerning what lies ahead. Is the erosion of the middle really inevitable? Are we in the midst of what economists call \"multiple equilibria,\" in which one unfavourable shift makes another, even worse, shift more probable? Or will a mix of natural mean reversion and responsive policies restore the soundness and benefits of the centre? Given the rapid changes in technology and political disruptions, it is hard to know what lies ahead.</p><p>But there seem to be enough indicators to suggest that, in certain areas, a strong middle can indeed be reclaimed if policies adapt quickly enough. That is probably the case when it comes to economic policies, where there is at last greater recognition of the importance of structural changes and distributional effects. For example, economists are beginning to resist the inclination to rely on too many simplifying assumptions that facilitate modeling but are removed from reality. They are also beginning to redress the inadequate inclusion of financial linkages and insights from behavioural science, as well as overemphasis on single equilibrium conditions. And they are deepening their understanding of accelerating structural changes associated with technology, the impact of China and other emerging economies, and the politics of anger. The more these changes feed into better policies, the greater the potential for political parties to present more compelling agendas, especially if they are presented by more engaging leaders. The decline of the middle in business is also likely to result in some pushback, though the impact will differ significantly by industry and will be continuously challenged by structural headwinds. It is more likely to occur in some industries, such as big tech, where a regulatory response will probably be one outcome of a developing backlash, and less likely for asset management. These developments have the potential to slow what, for now, has been a self-reinforcing migration away from the middle. But restoring faith in the feasibility and desirability of the middle-belief that the middle is strong enough to promote stability and prosperity-will take time and sustained effort. And that loss of faith, compounded by accelerating technological change and the fragmentation of international order, goes a long way toward explaining why the future seems less predictable, and why the average person feels more unsettled.</p><p>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0039047768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1M-10G1-JB5M-W2KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 5, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A498</classCode><className>MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CMR7</classCode><className>PARENT COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A0EC</classCode><className>MERGERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkZCODBEQTBEMjdDNDA1Njk5NDIxQjQ3MThGQ0MyMUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjRDRTUzQzBCMEIyNDU5QkE4QjFDMEE2Qjg2MUZDOTk</classCode><className>Mergers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009TDQ</classCode><className>US POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001309</classCode><className>PERSONAL &amp; FAMILY INCOME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A4CY</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A4CY</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

In an effort to attract new workers Foxconn is offering bonuses of 7,000 yuan ($995) following the shutdown, the South China Morning Post reports[1]. Returning Foxconn workers have also been offered bonuses of 3,000 yuan ($427) to return to work, Abacus[2] reported last week. Foxconn said in a statement that it's still taking the utmost care to protect its workers against the virus outbreak. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. The world's biggest iPhone maker is offering workers bonuses of more than twice their monthly salary to entice them to come work in the company's gradually re-opening factories. iPhone manufacturer Foxconn and was forced to shut down its China factories amid the coronavirus outbreak. At one point the company even diverted manufacturing to start producing face masks[4] and medical clothing. On Thursday, however, Foxconn announced its factories are slowly resuming work[5], and the company is trying some bold ploys to try and beef up its workforce once more. New hires at Foxconn's massive Zhengzhou factory are being offered 7,000 yuan ($995) to return to work, according to local reports per the South China Morning Post[6]. One local news report said that the bonus is staggered, with workers receiving 3,000 yuan after working 60 days and 4,000 after 90 days. The SCMP notes this represents a huge incentive for factory workers at the Zhengzhou site, as interviews with workers last year found that the average monthly salary was between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan.Employing up to 350,000 people, Zhengzhou is Foxconn's the world's biggest iPhone-making facility and is known colloquially as \"iPhone City.\"[7] Abacus reported last week that current Foxconn workers were also being offered bonuses of 3,000 yuan ($427)[8] to return to work. In a statement to the SCMP, Foxconn insisted it is still taking necessary precautions against the virus outbreak. \"With the current public health challenges linked to the coronavirus, we continue to place a high priority on the welfare of all our employees and we are applying all recommended health and hygiene practices, in accordance with the local laws and regulations, as part of our effort to ensure their health and safety.\" It added that it was taking a \"cautious approach\" to production schedules at its China facilities. Foxconn was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.NOW WATCH: Apple just revealed its AirPods Pro for $249, which feature noise cancellation.

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is central to analysing the data and making the whole process faster, reducing the time it takes to go from research to trials. Moderna (US:MRNA) was working with AWS on a range of drug candidates at the time; now it's using this same approach to fast track a potential Covid-19 vaccine. In no small part thanks to Amazon, Moderna is leading the race for a coronavirus vaccine. The implications need hardly be explained, albeit some of the shine has since come off the initial announcement by Moderna that phase 1 trials were going well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Using AWS is a powerful tool that didn't exist for drug companies before. It eliminates wrong pathways, blind alleys and wild goose chases in super-quick time. It's rather like playing chess against a computer that can analyse every potential move in a nanosecond while I try to remember how castling works - it's going to win.</p><p>But we're not talking about Moderna in this article; the above only serves to illustrate just what a powerful and important platform AWS has become. Not only can we find applications in just about every setting imaginable, it has become a behemoth that accounts for a third of the global cloud market and can count Apple as one of its biggest customers. </p><p>Amazon's cloud platform is a key reason behind the ongoing investment thesis for the stock. AWS revenues exceeded $10bn for the first time in Q1 this year, generating 13.5 per cent of total revenue, but 77 per cent of operating income. It's a high-margin business, generating more profit than any other division.</p><p>                     Deceleration                   </p><p>But AWS is not growing as fast as it was. Back in January Deutsche Bank warned that competition and some top-level personnel changes underscored the \"increased risk of further deceleration at AWS\".</p><p>Compared with Microsoft (US:MSFT), AWS growth is heading in the wrong direction. This may not be as big a worry as it may seem given AWS is just so big in the first place - Amazon accounts for around a third of cloud spending, versus about a fifth of sales being generated by Microsoft. But Goldman Sachs' biannual survey of IT spending at large companies suggests Microsoft's Azure is becoming a lot more popular. By 2023, the bank expects Azure to be the most-utilised cloud vendor. Overreliance on AWS for operating income growth could weigh on Amazon stock in the coming two to three years, although this looks to be fairly well appreciated by the market already.</p><p>                     Covid-proof                   </p><p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney is one of the leading watchers of Amazon. He sees the company as a long-term pick partly because of the pandemic. \"We view AMZN as a structural winner as the Covid-crisis accelerates the shift to online retail and businesses deepen their transformation to digital, benefiting AWS,\" he wrote in a recent note.</p><p>The e-commerce story needs little introduction. The pandemic and subsequent response by governments only makes consumers shop online a lot more. </p><p>RBC research shows, in the key US market at least, that consumers prefer Amazon to all others for their online shopping, followed by Walmart. Being popular matters when you want to add more products to your virtual shelves. </p><p>Mahaney highlights the potential for Amazon online grocery to further expand - currently it's just a tenth the size of Walmart in terms of sales. He expects growth of 24 per cent in this segment over the next three years. In the UK, Amazon has a partnership with Morrisons, although lately there has been some chatter about a tie-up with Marks and Spencer.</p><p>Stifel analyst Scott Devitt agrees, saying: \"We believe Amazon will be better positioned following Covid-19 given the upcoming substantial dislocation in traditional retail and long-term benefit in cloud services as digital transformation accelerates.\"</p><p>Both analysts cite AWS, of course, as the shift to remote working is powering incremental demand for cloud hosting. </p><p>Arguably what's more relevant - and instructive - is the amount Amazon is spending to make its business Covid-proof. After its Q1 results - which barely reflected the lockdown in the US - Amazon said it would spend $4bn to make sure workers were safe and ensure that deliveries, - which couldn't keep pace with an intense uptick in demand initially - can resume normal service. This means the company could swing to an operating loss of $1.5bn in the second quarter. </p><p>About $600m in cleaning supplies and $300m in testing was not forecast, but it's better than shutting fulfilment centres and handing much of the increase in demand to competitors. Only three months earlier the market chatter was on the cost of implementing one-day delivery for Prime members - an investment that investors have been happy to shrug off.</p><p>As ever with Amazon, the company is not looking to the next quarter earnings per share (EPS) but 5-10 years out, continually reinvesting profits when required. It was this attitude that took Amazon to where it is today and so long as the leadership doesn't change, there is little chance of this culture changing.</p><p>The return on investment from this $4bn will become abundantly clear towards the end of 2020 and into 2021 as we see increased demand for Amazon services. </p><p>In January - albeit before the Covid spending splurge was disclosed - Jefferies analysts explained: \"We continue to view valuation as supporting further outperformance and believe near-term spending has no bearing on AMZN's ability to drive long-term profit upside from faster revenue growth at higher-margin businesses (AWS &amp; advertising).\" In short, don't worry about Amazon's spending, look at the top-line growth.</p><p>                     Advertising: Amazon's best kept secret                   </p><p>Often overlooked by stockpickers dazzled by the online retail and AWS footprints, Amazon is also increasingly a major advertising player. The company is rather quiet on its ad business and doesn't break out the numbers fully. But we know advertising makes up the vast bulk of its 'other' segment. </p><p>Amazon's first office premises</p><p>In January the company said the division grew 40 per cent in the final quarter of 2019 to $4.8bn, while this momentum followed through into the first quarter 2020 as revenues for the division rose 44 per cent from a year before to $3.9bn. This was well ahead of growth in online sales (24 per cent), subscription services (28 per cent) and Amazon Web Services (33 per cent).</p><p>Advertising is important because it's high-margin and the growth underlines the way Amazon is disrupting Facebook (US:FB) and Google's (US:GOOGL) dominance. Increasingly Amazon will gain market share, albeit it won't overtake either. According to data from eMarketer, Amazon could account for 14 per cent of US digital ad revenues in 2023, up from 9 per cent last year. The more people shop on Amazon, the more traffic, the more ads. It's a virtuous circle that looks tough to break.</p><p>In advertising, as in everything else, Amazon is capable of disruption wherever it decides to go, and this is one of its great attributes.</p><p>                     Anti-trust angst                   </p><p>Disruption and dominance do not come without drawbacks, notably the attention of regulators and politicians with an eye for re-election. One US senator recently called for a criminal antitrust investigation, just to add more legal trouble on top of the many civil cases the company is already answering.</p><p>In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Republican senator Josh Hawley said the company \"has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly\". </p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon chief executive and the world's richest man, is an easy target for populists. And he owns The Washington Post, which has come under fire from Donald Trump for, well, just about everything. Of course, antitrust concerns have been circling Amazon for a while. Amazon's relationship with its third-party sellers is increasingly a source of concern. And, ever since the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, big tech has been an increasingly easy target for Washington and Brussels. </p><p>Amazon is facing multiple antitrust probes in the US and Europe relating to various parts of the business. The US Congress recently called on Mr Bezos to testify in an investigation into whether Amazon unfairly used data on third-party sellers to boost its own products - the source of Senator Hawley's concerns, which were reported after a Wall Street Journal investigation. If true, it would put Amazon in hot water as it would directly contradict its previous Congressional testimony. Thus far, Mr Bezos has demurred. Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission has widened its anti-trust investigation beyond the company's retail business to include AWS.</p><p>Most think that break-up risks are relatively low, but greater regulatory scrutiny of its business is a potential problem and increased regulation in both e-commerce and advertising are both risks. EU fines can sting - Google has been slapped with more than $9bn in fines by zealous former European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in the past three years. </p><p>Meanwhile, while battles with unions and worries about working conditions are also a perennial bugbear and source of more political virtue-signalling, they have so far failed to handicap the fastest horse in the race.</p><p>                     Spinning top                   </p><p>Trying to call the top on Amazon stock has always been a mug's game; it achieved escape velocity long ago. Whatever else happens, it seems Amazon keeps on making new highs - but can it continue to do so?</p><p>Firstly, true it's very well priced. But it always has been. Trading at about 115 times on a trailing 12-month basis, it's more expensive than it was last year, but cheaper than the +200 times levels in 2016-17 and about where it was in the autumn of 2018. EPS is often lumpy: in growth stocks that plough free cash straight back into the business, price/earnings (PE) multiples can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, but the point is that Amazon is not much pricier than it was last year and is far less pricey than it has been historically. Earnings multiples have never really told the story about Amazon.</p><p>From a technical perspective, there is evidence that AMZN is now a bit overbought and the rally has become overextended. On each of the last four big tops for the stock, it has extended well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and been forced back to - and under - this SMA support level before resuming the broader uptrend. We now see a potential double formation too and we are way too far extended at the top end of the Bollinger bands. The subsequent narrowing of this envelope combined with the double top and the extension above the 200-day SMA suggests we may see quite a strong pullback to within the longer-term average. </p><p>So, should we be looking to short Amazon from here? There may be a potential short-term trade on this extension. But longer-term you would tend to see Amazon as - in the words of Mr Mahaney from RBC - a \"structural winner\". Funnily enough, it could be AWS, through Moderna, that helps get us back in the bars, high-street shops and cinemas quicker, and means we use Amazon a little less than we do now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-63232510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600W-JH91-F021-62NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1928\"/><timeReceived>5:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Neil Wilsonweighs up the investment case</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back in January it was announced that Moderna (US:MRNA), a US biotech company with a market capitalisation of about $7bn (\u00a35.7bn) that few people outside of US biotech would have known much about, was working with Amazon's (US:AMZN) cloud technology to develop a class of medicines that apply messenger RNA. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is central to analysing the data and making the whole process faster, reducing the time it takes to go from research to trials. Moderna was using AWS on a range of drug candidates at the time; now it's using this same approach to fast track a potential Covid-19 vaccine. In no small part thanks to Amazon, Moderna is leading the race for a coronavirus vaccine. The implications need hardly be explained, albeit some of the shine has since come offthe initial announcement by Moderna that Phase I trials were going well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Using AWS is a powerful tool that didn't exist for drug companies before. It eliminates wrong pathways, blind alleys and wild goose chases in superquick time. It's rather like playing chess against a computer that can analyse every potential move in a nanosecond while I try to remember how castling works - it's going to win.</p><p>But we're not talking about Moderna in this article; the above only serves to illustrate just what a powerful and important platform AWS has become. Not only can we find applications in just about every setting imaginable, it has become a behemoth that accounts for a third of the global cloud market and can count Apple as one of its biggest customers.</p><p>Amazon's cloud platform is a key reason behind the ongoing investment thesis for the stock. AWS revenues exceeded $10bn for the first time in the first quarter this year, generating 13.5 per cent of total revenue, but 77 per cent of operating income. It's a high-margin business, generating more profit than any other division.</p><p>Deceleration But AWS is not growing as fast as it was. Back in January Deutsche Bank warned that competition and some top-level personnel changes underscored the \"increased risk of further deceleration at AWS\".</p><p>Compared with Microsoft (US:MSFT), AWS growth is heading in the wrong direction. This may not be as big a worry as it may seem given AWS is just so big in the first place - Amazon accounts for around a third of cloud spending, versus about a fifth of sales being generated by Microsoft. But Goldman Sachs' biannual survey of IT spending at large companies suggests Microsoft's Azure is becoming a lot more popular. By 2023, the bank expects Azure to be the most-utilised cloud vendor. Overreliance on AWS for operating income growth could weigh on Amazon stock in the coming two to three years, although this looks to be Covid-proof RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney is one of the leading watchers of Amazon. He sees the company as a long-term pick partly because of the pandemic. \"We view AMZN as a structural winner as the Covid-crisis accelerates the shift to online retail and businesses deepen their transformation to digital, benefiting AWS,\" he wrote in a recent note.</p><p>The e-commerce story needs little introduction.</p><p>The pandemic and subsequent response by governments only makes consumers shop online a lot more.</p><p>RBC research shows, in the key US market at least, that consumers prefer Amazon to all others for their online shopping, followed by Walmart. Being popular matters when you want to add more products to your virtual shelves.</p><p>Mahaney highlights the potential for Amazon online grocery to further expand - currently it's just a tenth the size of Walmart in terms of sales. He expects growth of 24 per cent in this segment over the next three years. In the UK, Amazon has a partnership with Wm Morrisons (MRW), although lately there has been some chatter about a tie-up with Marks and Spencer.</p><p>Stifel analyst Scott Devitt agrees, saying: \"We believe Amazon will be better positioned following Covid-19 given the upcoming substantial dislocation in traditional retail and long-term benefit in cloud services as digital transformation accelerates.\"</p><p>Both analysts cite AWS, of course, as the shift to remote working is powering incremental demand for cloud hosting.</p><p>Arguably what's more relevant - and instructive - is the amount Amazon is spending to make its business Covid-proof. After its first-quarter results - which barely reflected the lockdown in the US - Amazon said it would spend $4bn to make sure workers were safe and ensure that deliveries - which couldn't keep pace with an intense uptick in demand initially - could resume normal service. This means the company could swing to an operating loss of $1.5bn in the second quarter.</p><p>About $600m in cleaning supplies and $300m in testing was not forecast, but it's better than shutting fulfilment centres and handing much of the increase in demand to competitors. Only three months earlier the market chatter was on the cost of implementing one-day delivery for Prime members - an investment that investors have been happy to shrug off. As ever with Amazon, the company is not looking to the next quarter earnings per share (EPS) but 5-10 years out, continually reinvesting profits when required. It was this attitude that took Amazon to where it is today and so long as the leadership doesn't change, there is little chance of this culture changing.</p><p>The return on investment from this $4bn will become abundantly clear towards the end of 2020 and into 2021 as we see increased demand for Amazon services.</p><p>In January - albeit before the Covid spending splurge was disclosed - Jefferies analysts explained: \"We continue to view valuation as supporting further outperformance and believe near-term spending has no bearing on AMZN's ability to drive long-term profit upside from faster revenue growth at higher-margin businesses (AWS &amp; advertising).\" In short, don't worry about Amazon's spending, look at the top-line growth.</p><p>Advertising: Amazon's best kept secret Often overlooked by stockpickers dazzled by the online retail and AWS footprints, Amazon is also increasingly a major advertising player. The company is rather quiet on its ad business and doesn't break out the numbers fully. But we know advertising makes up the vast bulk of its 'other' segment.</p><p>In January the company said the division grew 40 per cent in the final quarter of 2019 to $4.8bn, while this momentum followed through into the first quarter 2020 as revenues for the division rose 44 per cent from a year before to $3.9bn. This was well ahead of growth in online sales (24 per cent), subscription services (28 per cent) and Amazon Web Services (33 per cent).</p><p>Advertising is important because it's high-margin and the growth underlines the way Amazon is disrupting Facebook (US:FB) and Google's (US:GOOGL) dominance. Increasingly Amazon will gain market share, albeit it won't overtake either. According to data from eMarketer, Amazon could account for 14 per cent of US digital ad revenues in 2023, up from 9 per cent last year. The more people shop on Amazon, the more traffic, the more ads. It's a virtuous circle that looks tough to break.</p><p>In advertising, as in everything else, Amazon is capable of disruption wherever it decides to go, and this is one of its great attributes.</p><p>Anti-trust angst Disruption and dominance do not come without drawbacks, notably the attention of regulators and politicians with an eye for re-election. One US senator recently called for a criminal antitrust investigation, just to add more legal trouble on top of the many civil cases the company is already answering.</p><p>In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Republican senator Josh Hawley said the company \"has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly\".</p><p>JeffBezos, Amazon chief executive and the world's richest man, is an easy target for populists. And he owns The Washington Post, which has come under fire from Donald Trump for, well, just about everything. Of course, antitrust concerns have been circling Amazon for a while. Amazon's relationship with its third-party sellers is increasingly a source of concern. And, ever since the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, big tech has been an increasingly easy target for Washington and Brussels.</p><p>Amazon is facing multiple antitrust probes in the US and Europe relating to various parts of the business. The US Congress recently called on Mr Bezos to testify in an investigation into whether Amazon unfairly used data on third-party sellers to boost its own products - the source of Senator Hawley's concerns, which were reported after a Wall Street Journal investigation. If true, it would put Amazon in hot water as it would directly contradict its previous Congressional testimony. Thus far, Mr Bezos has demurred. Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission has widened its anti-trust investigation beyond the company's retail business to include AWS.</p><p>Most think that break-up risks are relatively low, but greater regulatory scrutiny of its business is a potential problem and increased regulation in both e-commerce and advertising are both risks. European Union fines can sting - Google has been slapped with more than $9bn in fines by zealous former European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in the past three years.</p><p>Meanwhile, while battles with unions and worries about working conditions are also a perennial bugbear and source of more political virtue-signalling, they have so far failed to handicap the fastest horse in the race.</p><p>Spinning top Trying to call the top on Amazon stock has always been a mug's game; it achieved escape velocity long ago. Whatever else happens, it seems Amazon keeps on making new highs - but can it continue to do so? Firstly, true it's very well priced. But it always has been. Trading at about 115 times on a trailing 12-month basis, it's more expensive than it was last year, but cheaper than the +200 times levels in 2016-17 and about where it was in the autumn of 2018. EPS is often lumpy: in growth stocks that plough free cash straight back into the business, price/earnings (PE) multiples can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, but the point is that Amazon is not much pricier than it was last year and is far less pricey than it has been historically. Earnings multiples have never really told the story about Amazon.</p><p>From a technical perspective, there is evidence that AMZN is now a bit overbought and the rally has become overextended. On each of the last four big tops for the stock, it has extended well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and been forced back to - and under - this SMA support level before resuming the broader uptrend. We now see a potential double formation too and we are way too far extended at the top end of the Bollinger bands. The subsequent narrowing of this envelope combined with the double top and the extension above the 200-day SMA suggests we may see quite a strong pullback to within the longer-term average.</p><p>So, should we be looking to short Amazon from here? There may be a potential short-term trade on this extension. But longer-term you would tend to see Amazon as - in the words of Mr Mahaney from RBC - a \"structural winner\". Funnily enough, it could be AWS, through Moderna, that helps get us back in the bars, high-street shops and cinemas quicker, and means we use Amazon a little less than we do now.</p><p>1/3 AMAZON WEB SERVICES ACCOUNTS FOR ONETHIRD OF THE GLOBAL CLOUD MARKET  ;

Megan Boxall and the companies team report The steady lifting of lockdown measures has brought a breath of normality back to life in Britain. Busy roads, bustling parks and blooming garden centres are almost reflective of a normal May weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But although we seem to have emerged from the post-apocalyptic mood of lockdown, there is certainly a sense that life is never going back to the old normal. Trends that were starting to shape the way we live precoronavirus have been exposed, and in some cases accelerated by the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To capitalise on these trends, investors should look beyond these shores. We have picked 15 international stocks with the ability to bounce back quickly and the capacity to thrive in a post-coronavirus world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TECHNOLOGY AT THE HEART OF ALL WE DO Satya Nadella, chief executive of software giant Microsoft (US:MSFT), says his company has seen \"two years' worth of digital transformation in two months\". That's hardly surprising given the sudden increase in remote working and growing demand for cloud infrastructure courtesy of coronavirus.</p><p>But the demand for work-from-home software will not keep rising indefinitely - we're not all going to stay away from our offices for good - nor will online socialising and entertainment permanently replace their physical equivalents. That said, the digital transformation that sparked 15 per cent growth in revenues at Microsoft in the first quarter of 2020 is unlikely to entirely reverse. Coronavirus has heightened individual and corporate awareness of the need for strong connectivity, including software and telecoms infrastructure.</p><p>It has also brought a new angle to the debate around use of data - government sponsored tracking systems have popped up in many countries in the past few months as authorities scramble to get a full picture of the scale of the coronavirus pandemic. The protection of people's health gives personal data collection a far more acceptable purpose than targeted marketing campaigns. Regulators who have interrogated big tech executives with increasing determination for the past five years might be willing to take a softer stance in the future.</p><p>There are, understandably, doubters. \"I'm glad that they're willing to help,\" Republican senator Josh Hawley said of Alphabet's (US:GOOGL) efforts to develop screening mechanisms for Covid-19. \"I hope that they're actually helping and not using this as an opportunity to drum up business.\"</p><p>But the future of technology is not just about products and services that are already in place, or what Alex Newman described in his recent feature as \"an unending era of ever-sharper iPhone cameras\". Innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems - resource competition, climate change, inequality - are increasingly being built by some of the world's biggest technology companies.</p><p>There is no better example of this than Alphabet whose 'other bets' division is developing many new technologies in the fields of artificial intelligence, driverless vehicles and green energy. Alphabet's growing Software giants for work and play: Microsoft, Adobe Aside from their exposure to one of the biggest trends in a post-coronavirus world, US tech giants are, mostly, exceptionally high-quality businesses. They have taken very good care of their cash and are going to get through the crisis without any external financial aid, even though they are dishing out millions to help fight the illness. The comparison with cumbersome businesses asking governments for bailouts is stark. The software giants, in particular, have very impressive revenue predictability. Microsoft is increasingly generating revenue from subscriptions, which are reliable and come with very high margins. Adobe (US:ADBE) pioneered the industry's shift from lumpy licensing revenues to subscriptions in 2013. Its proportion of recurring revenue has climbed steadily since then and hit 90 per cent of total sales in 2019.</p><p>Maintaining subscriptions requires very little ongoing expenditure, which means the bulk of the revenue at both Microsoft and Adobe comes with gross margins of almost 100 per cent. This feeds back into an exceptionally high return on capital employed and a free cash flow conversion that has averaged more than 100 per cent at both companies for the past five years. We think Adobe and Microsoft should sit near the top of most investors' international wish lists. LA portfolio of early-stage companies has recently drawn comparisons with Warren Buffett's investment giant Berkshire Hathaway, which booked its place in investment history books when it began reinvesting the profits of its insurance business back into other companies. The 'Sage of Omaha' himself expressed his regret back in 2017 that he hadn't cottoned on to Alphabet's growth story sooner. But the era of 'big tech' is far from over - arguably its dominance will only increase as the Covid-19 crisis accelerates key trends and paves the way for longer lasting behavioural changes.</p><p>The king of data: Alphabet Alphabet's biggest revenue generator is advertising within search engine Google, the go-to place for online queries. The company's dominance in the advertising market has helped its parent company generate extraordinary levels of cash from its operations. At the end of March 2020, Alphabet was sitting on over $100bn of net cash.</p><p>But the ad model is not the future of Alphabet, whose diverse activities offer multiple growth levers. YouTube is pushing into e-sports live-streaming and increasingly generates turnover from subscriptions. These sales form part of Alphabet's 'other' segment, which, together with increased purchases from the Google Play mobile app store, saw revenue jump by more than a fifth to $4.4bn in the first three months of the year.</p><p>As the 'internet of things' moves closer to reality, cloud computing will become increasingly important. Alphabet may trail market leaders Amazon and Microsoft with only an 8 per cent share, but its cloud business is growing fast. Google also has what none of its peers have: an unrivalled ability to understand and analyse data. In the future, companies won't just want to host their data in the cloud, they will want to be able to analyse it too and Google's systems should come into their own. NK A NEW ERA IN CONSUMERISM It would be unfair to say that digital shopping is a trend that has been sparked by coronavirus. Amazon (US:AMZN) (see boxout and also our World's Hottest Shares feature on page 32) upended the book retail industry in the early 2000s and has been applying the same ruthless innovation to every sector it has targeted to enter since.</p><p>But perhaps the digital habits have filtered through to more sectors and even populations owing to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. In April, headline US retail sales - a measure of sales in stores and restaurants - plunged 16.4 per cent, according to data from the commerce department. That same month, non-store sales rose by more than a fifth. With these trends unlikely to die down after the pandemic has passed, an increasingly digital consumer world is looking likely.</p><p>That would help explain why PayPal's (US:PYPL) share price recently hit an all-time high, even though most of its key markets are entering a recession. Investors are clearly more focused on the fact that a greater proportion of global expenditure will be happening digitally in the coming years than the concern that job losses and recession could stunt overall spending.</p><p>Regardless of the immediate economic challenges, a digital strategy and e-commerce arm are crucial to longterm success for retailers and personal goods companies. Keeping one eye on the future is also important for the next link in the chain - the property companies that provide for the retail industry. On one hand, commercial landlords who rent to retailers are sharing in the pain felt by shuttered shops, but on the other, demand for industrial premises that can serve online demand is soaring. Stag Industrials (US:STAG) provides clear evidence of that trend. The group's rent collection has proved resilient since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, as it collected 99 per cent of March base rental billings and 90 per cent of April base rental billing. Perhaps that is not surprising - the company's number one tenant is Amazon, which is currently servicing more deliveries than it has ever done before.</p><p>A volumes game: Visa Visa's (US:V) main activity is to provide banks and other financial institutions with the technology and branding for their payment products - a highly profitable volume game. In recent years, the group's free cash flow margin - that is the proportion of sales being converted into cash - has exceeded 50 per cent.</p><p>Consequently, market expectations remain high. Although falling consumer activity means earnings are expected to decline 8 per cent to $5.03 per share this year, analysts predict that profits will soon swing back to regain their momentum of double-digit annual growth. Whether that collective view reflects an overoptimistic assessment of spending and travel, it's worth noting that the company has beaten consensus earnings forecasts in all but two quarters over the past five years.</p><p>It also seems likely that Covid-19 will accelerate two major secular trends in Visa's favour, as virus-averse consumers shun physical currency and e-commerce expands its boundless reach into what RBC analysts term \"non-traditional\" purchase categories, such as food and drugs. In the longer term, it's harder to forecast the trajectory of payments solutions and what competition Visa could face. But solid organic growth, a pre-eminent brand and strong margins mean the company is superbly positioned to adapt to technological change. AN A profitable property play: Stag Industrials Stag Industrials seeks to acquire under-let or vacant industrial properties and increase the rental income. It has a good track record of executing on that strategy, for instance during the first quarter of this year it sold three buildings for a total $102m, resulting in a gain of $47m on the initial aggregate purchase price.</p><p>Stag benefits from a diversified tenant base, with no single occupier accounting for more than 2 per cent of annual rental income. The group's balance sheet is also in relatively robust health - it had a debt-to-equity ratio of 34.2 per cent and available cash of $325m at the end of March. In April, the group also refinanced $300m of unsecured debt previously scheduled to mature within the next year.</p><p>Annual uplifts and rent reviews boosted same-store cash net operating income by 2.5 per cent during the first quarter to $73.4m. However, management is guiding towards same-store net operating income growth of between 0 and 1 per cent for 2020, based on credit loss guidance of 1.25 percentage points, a tenant retention range of between 60 and 70 per cent and around a 0.7 percentage point impact for a top-10 tenant move-out. EP The 'everything' investment: AmazonAmazon shares defy the normal rules of fundamental analysis. But being priced for both growth and perfection (62 times consensus earnings forecasts) has failed to stop a near-six-fold appreciation over the past five years. In part, this has been due to an unwavering allocation to fast-growing US-based market winners, of which Amazon is an exemplar. It is also recognition of a long-sighted, often creative and sometimes brutal drive to dominate every market it touches.</p><p>First-quarter results were a prime example. Predictably, headlines focused on revenues that smashed analyst forecasts, and earnings that were hampered by Covid-19-related costs. The bigger story was Jeff Bezos' plan to invest all of this quarter's operating profits to build a pandemic-proof supply chain, and position Amazon as a leader in at-home testing.</p><p>That foresight and imagination, as well as Amazon's sheer corporate power, explain why the investment case rarely focuses on employees' working conditions, or a monopolistic vein which could one day attract political heat. Moreover, the shares represent less an exceptionally well-run conglomerate, than the spirit animal of disruption in a seemingly-unlimited range of sectors. It's difficult to put a price on that (see page 32 for more on Amazon). AN Fitness goals: Garmin Garmin's fitness division has made a strong start to the year. Revenues here rose by 24 per cent during the first three months of 2020 to $224m. But fitness isn't the group's only focus area. It also houses aviation, marine, outdoor, and automobile divisions - selling specialist tracking devices such as autopilot systems, weather radars and, for the piscatorial among us, 'fishfinders'. This diversification should help protect the company in downturns.</p><p>That said, management has withdrawn guidance, citing \"rapid and unpredictable economic changes\". But it entered the crisis in a robust position. Net sales rose by 12 per cent last year to $3.8bn, while operating profits climbed by more than a fifth to $945m. The group also boasted a strong balance sheet, with zero debt and $2.6bn in cash - a financial position it reiterated in late April, and which should be sufficient to \"weather any long-term impact\" of Covid-19 in JP Morgan's view. That cash also underpins Garmin's sizeable dividend, which rose from $2.12 per share to $2.28 in 2019. HC Look beyond coronavirus: AdidasGerman sportswear giant Adidas (GER:ADS) has all the makings of a company well placed to weather the Covid-19 storm - a solid balance sheet, big brand and a leading position in a market that is set to benefit from current trends. But by the end of its first quarter, the coronavirus pandemic had forced the company's sales down by almost a fifth, with 70 per cent of its stores around the world closed.</p><p>Still, that doesn't mean its long-term outlook has been dampened. Adidas management is rigorously preparing the company for the future. Flagship stores and a major e-commerce operation are replacing smaller highstreet retail sites, while online sales have risen from 3 per cent of sales in 2014 to 11 per cent last year.</p><p>The e-commerce channel has also proved beneficial to the company's cash flow statement as its own online sales are converted immediately into cash, whereas online sales through wholesale partners take much longer to appear on the company's books. Management can also manage its inventory better if it has full control of its sales channels, providing further stability to the balance sheet, which included net cash of (EURO)873m at the start of 2020. AJ Quick off the Merck New-York-listed Merck (US:MRK) is a leader in immuno-oncology - a field of medicine that has changed the way we treat cancer by stimulating patient's immune systems so they can fight tumour cells.</p><p>Merck's Keytruda immunotherapy only hit the market in 2015, but has already been approved across 14 different types of cancers and in the first quarter of 2020 reported 45 per cent revenue growth to $3.3bn - contributing almost a third of Merck's total pharmaceutical sales ($10.7bn). But Merck is far from a one-drug wonder. Its revenues are diversified across various other products, including the Gardasil HPV vaccine and the Januvia type-two diabetes treatment.</p><p>True, like many other companies, Merck is enduring coronavirus-led disruption. Distancing measures are knocking demand for doctor-administered medicines, and the group has lowered its full-year guidance. But, while the future might be uncertain, the past offers a solid foundation for growth.</p><p>Over the three years to last December, revenues and pre-tax profits rose at a compound annual growth rate of 6 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.</p><p>Meanwhile, Merck has also made generous returns to shareholders, paying out $10.5bn in 2019 alone in the form of dividends and buybacks. HC HEALTH IN SHARPER FOCUS The fitness technology industry was worth $26bn in 2018. And, according to the Global Wellness Institute, it is set to enjoy an average annual growth rate of 8.6 per cent over the next few years - reaching $39.8bn in 2023.</p><p>Market projections should be treated with additional caution now that we're in the middle of a pandemic. But there's also an argument that lockdown measures may have catalysed an existing trend - driving even more of us towards digital exercise products while we cannot go to the gym. Any such acceleration would be good news for Garmin (US:GRMN), for which fitness constitutes more than 25 per cent of revenues.</p><p>The same trends have driven demand at fitness equipment retailers and boosted the 'athleisure' market, which is now expected to hit a $257bn valuation by 2026, from $155bn last year. Meanwhile, gym companies are desperate to open - aside from the revenue they are missing out on when in lockdown, there is a real danger than alternative solutions might dissuade people from continuing their expensive memberships.</p><p>It's not just fitness goals we have in mind when we talk about post-coronavirus health priorities. The pandemic has exposed frailties in global health systems that need to be addressed - better hygiene and personal care among them.</p><p>For now, the pharmaceutical industry is dominated by discussion about testing and vaccines for Covid-19, but even when the current pandemic dies down, focus on infectious diseases is likely to remain. Indeed, a strategy for dealing with illnesses caused by both viruses and bacteria has been among the top priorities for the World Health Organisation for many years. Regulation can help stimulate investment in areas of unmet need.</p><p>The need for medical efficiency - which includes keeping patients out of hospital - has also been accelerated by the pandemic. For too long the pharmaceutical industry has thrived on a model of making big margins from 'maintenance medicines' - those that treat nonlife-threatening diseases - and has trailed the innovation coming out of universities and research centres. Greater focus on commercialising the world's best new science, including genetic medicine and digital health, is crucial if we are going to avoid future pandemics.</p><p>HOW WE EAT Life under lockdown has transformed the way we eat. The coronavirus pandemic has been terrible for restaurants and bars. But it has also sparked a surge in supermarket shopping, driving people to cook (or microwave) at home. And Swiss-listed Nestl\u00e9 (CH:NESN) has ridden the crest of that wave. The food and drinks behemoth beat analysts' expectations for the first three months of 2020, unveiling a 4.3 per cent uptick in organic revenues to CHF20.8bn (\u00a317.7bn), driven by demand for frozen food and baking products.</p><p>Stockpiling long-life goods during lockdown is a useful string to the bow of those who argue that the recent rise in healthy eating is a short-term fad, driven by wealthy westerners in times of prosperity. It's true that price might become more problematic if we are entering a long period of economic turbulence. But the cost and availability of healthy food has come down dramatically in the past few years. That is especially true of vegetarian and vegan products. Demand for meat-free food increased by almost 1,000 per cent in 2017 and has continued to rise sharply as food producers help make vegetarian options more readily available. Supermarkets now stock many meat alternatives at reasonable prices and vegetarians in restaurants have more options than mushroom risotto and goats cheese tart. Even McDonald's (US:MCD) now sells vegan burgers.</p><p>It isn't just the demand side of the food industry where sentiment is starting to shift. Meat supply is coming under scrutiny as environmentalists call into question the efficiency of production - it reportedly takes 10 kilograms (kg) of vegetables to grow every one kg of cow. And the push towards greener lifestyles is certainly not expected to disappear postcoronavirus. Indeed, environmental initiatives are being touted as a key area of investment to help bring us out of the economic hole created by the pandemic and subsequent lockdown - a topic we discussed at length in the introduction to our new series of features 'A New Future'.</p><p>GOING GREENER Consumer demand for green initiatives - including veganism, slower fashion and 'staycations' - is just one part of the clean environment story. Policy is also important. National decarbonisation targets encourage governments to offer subsidies for clean energy development and usage. The third (and perhaps most crucial) link in the chain is a greater capacity to supply green energy. In the past few years as the cost of building windfarms has come down, efficiency has increased and demand has gone up. Britain now plans to generate a third of its power from wind by 2030.</p><p>It is worth being wary of the fact that a shift in demand for electricity caused by coronavirus and the expected economic stagnation might dent the momentum behind green energy projects. But then many governments want to harness their post-coronavirus recovery plans into boosting low-carbon initiatives. Under slogans such as 'build back better' and the 'Green New Deal', they are attempting to build an Asset light, profit heavy: McDonald's The frailties of the restaurant industry - expensive overexpansion resulting in high overheads; tight margins and cash flows; and a reliance on tourism - have been magnified by coronavirus. Many will not survive the repercussions, among them heavily indebted businesses and privately managed companies that never expected they would need more than a few months of rainy-day cash. Even when lockdown measures begin to ease, trade is expected to remain low for some time owing to continued social distancing measures.</p><p>Restaurant and bar owners with low operating costs and a strong ability to turn revenue into cash are the best placed to survive the ongoing challenges. And as competitors fall by the wayside and behaviour changes, they are also in the best position to keep expanding.</p><p>Fast-food behemoth McDonald's relies on an asset-light business model through which more than 90 per cent of its 39,000 restaurants are operated as franchises. This provides a relatively predictable source of cash flow in exchange for limited capital intensity - franchisees pay McDonald's rent and a percentage of their restaurant's sales as royalties while shouldering much of the required capital investment and operating costs. The margin McDonald's makes on franchises has topped 80 per cent in recent years versus less than a 20 per cent operating profit margin for company-operated restaurants. As the shift to franchises continues, the group's operating profit margin has improved from 28.1 per cent in 2015 to 43 per cent last year.</p><p>Investment in technology is boosting average customer spend. Meanwhile store formats are being rejigged to accommodate self-service terminals, mobile app order pick-ups and deliveries. Through partnerships with third-party services such as Uber Eats, 'McDelivery' sales have more than tripled over the past three years, reaching $4bn in 2019. NK A store-cupboard staple: Nestle Nestle was in a strong position before the virus struck - benefiting from geographical diversification and serious brand power. Premium goods constitute 26 per cent of Nestle's sales, but entry-level and mainstream products make up the remainder. Analysts at Barclays note that this \"would be defensive if consumers down-trade\". The company also has an expanding online offering - e-commerce sales soared by 29.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, taking this channel to more than a tenth of overall revenues for the first time ever.</p><p>Moreover, the group has continued to fine-tune its vast portfolio to focus on trend-driven nutrition, health and wellness brands. With former healthcare executive Mark Schneider at the helm, it has made more than 50 transactions in the past three years. These include the acquisition of Sweet Earth in 2017 - enhancing Nestle's position in the fastgrowing plant-based food arena - as well as the recent disposal of its US ice-cream business for $4bn.</p><p>Short-term guidance may yet change. But like the shiny sweets housed under its brand umbrella, Nestle arguably offers a 'quality street' to investors seeking diversified revenues - not to mention attractive payouts. At CHF104, the shares offer a forward dividend yield of almost 3 per cent. HC economic model that doesn't rely on so much fossil fuel usage. Coronavirus and its subsequent lockdown has revealed that we can live in a world where we are using less energy.</p><p>What's more, oil's doldrums are now showing investors a fuller picture of the opportunities for green energy investment. Crashing prices mean the economics that drove massive oil and gas projects are now gone, and renewables projects can offer equal returns with a green selling point. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie says on a pure numbers basis renewables projects now make as much sense as a new oil field. At $35 a barrel an oil project would give an average internal rate of return of 6 per cent, the same as a low-risk wind or solar project.</p><p>Looking ahead at wind turbine demand, Canaccord Genuity analysts see installed capacity rising fourfold in the next 20 years, to 115Gwp. This would cover around 60 per cent of the UK's electricity needs and largely be in the form of offshore projects in the North Sea.</p><p>Rolling with the times: Orsted Having started life as Danish Oil and Natural Gas (Dong) Energy, Orsted (Den:ORSTED) has reinvented itself over the past decade, shifting from black to green energy. The group is aiming for an average of 90 per cent of its cash profits (Ebitda) to come from long-term regulated and contracted wind power activities.</p><p>While its 6.8 gigawatts (GW) of installed offshore wind capacity is predominantly in Europe, it is expanding into the US as well as Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</p><p>The first quarter of 2020 saw cash profits surge by a third year on year to DKr6.8bn (\u00a3810m). This was propelled by the ramp-up of power generation from newer projects and high wind speeds in Europe. Net debt of DKr27.1bn was up 50 per cent since the December year-end, but the plan to divest stakes in its wind farms could help keep this in check.</p><p>Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the asset base remains fully operational and forward hedging provides insulation from power price volatility. Although there could be a limited impact on construction projects and some commissioning delays in the US, short-term disruption shouldn't detract from the overall investment case - the world's green energy transition will continue. NK A green leader: Vestas The comparison with oil and gas companies has always been tough for renewable project developers. For greenminded investors, there is no question who to back, but oil and gas companies have kept generalists on board with their 6 per cent-plus dividends. And with the potential rewards from oil and gas projects falling, more traditional energy companies are starting to ramp up investment in renewables.</p><p>They will be playing catch-up with turbine manufacturer Vestas (Den:VWS). Last year, the Danish company set a record for grid-connected wind capacity installed, at 11.3 GW, according to WoodMac, and has the largest slice of the pie globally, at around 17 per cent in 2019.</p><p>Its outlook for this has been affected by Covid-19, but as of 31 March it had a backlog of around (EURO)16bn in turbine orders. The company is also expected to generate around (EURO)18bn of service revenue from its currently installed turbine base. These service revenues come with very high operating margins of around 25 per cent, against an overall operating margin of 8.3 per cent in 2019. AH Ignore the theatrics: TeslaTesla's (US:TSLA) place in the automotive world is shown by its March quarter results, which includes $354m of regulatory credit sales to fellow carmakers. Tesla has a surplus of these credits and sells to other automotive companies in the US that have not hit government quotas for building electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p>Shareholders are not fussed by balance-sheet theatrics or an almost $2bn downward shift in free cash flow, to negative $895m. They even ignored Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's tweet on 1 May that the company's share price was \"too high\".</p><p>Looking ahead, as major carmakers catch up with Tesla in terms of EV production, it is pushing hard to maintain an advantage in range and self-driving technology. This is made easier by its control over the battery manufacturing process.</p><p>China is a crucial market for the company to maintain its leading role, because this is where around half of the world's electric cars are, according to the International Energy Agency. The company is building a new factory outside Shanghai to pump cars directly into the market, and has cut the Model 3 price specifically to keep it under the threshold for government EV subsidies. AH Bouncebackability Considering he runs a company that makes considerable revenues from travel hubs, L'Oreal's (Fra:OR) chief executive, Jean-Paul Agon, has been remarkably calm during the coronavirus pandemic. That composure perhaps stems from the fact that the French cosmetics giant is ideally placed to recover quickly: it sells via multiple channels, including a highly profitable e-commerce arm; it owns a vast range of products spanning the essential, premium and pharmaceutical branches of the cosmetics market; and its local supply chains mean it has been able to reopen in China (a key growth engine) without waiting for the rest of the world to get back on its feet.</p><p>With its imperious brand power and strong balance sheet, the company has the stability to deal with the challenges of coronavirus and it ticks the three boxes (resilience, recovery potential and cash burn) identified by ValuAnalysis as \"essential in navigating the current crisis\".</p><p>Wall Street has done its best to ignore the pandemic and impending recession. After a sharp sell-off in early March, the S&amp;P 500 bounced back almost as quickly as it fell and has now returned to June 2019 levels. That resurgence has made it even harder to pick stocks. Investors are now not only facing uncertainty, but the same toppy valuations as last summer.</p><p>With these challenges in mind, stockpicking in coronavirus-infected markets has become a hotly debated topic. Should we focus on quality, or is it better to seek out value now that weaknesses have been exposed? Is 'growth at all costs' a sustainable business model, or should we be looking for well-run businesses with ample cash? The truth is, we don't know. But logic and history suggest that quality companies recover the strongest after financial crises.
