WhatsApp will expand banking services in rural areas and work with the \u201cinformal economy,\u201d an official said, according to a Reuters report . Facebook\u2019s investment in Reliance could give it a leg up with the Indian company\u2019s retail business, which is expanding, too.   \u201cWe now want to open up with more banks over this coming year to help simplify and expand banking services, especially to the rural and lower-income segments,\u201d said Abhijit Bose, WhatsApp\u2019s India head, speaking at a webcast FinTech summit.   He said WhatsApp will also work with financial institutions to expand offerings.   \u201cOur collective aim over the next two to three years should be to help low-wage workers and the unorganized, informal economy easily access three products \u2014 insurance, micro-credit and pensions,\u201d Bose said.   The news outlet noted WhatsApp has also been running its own payments service in India, with limited success, for more than two years. WhatsApp said it has met Indian regulators\u2019 requests for its expansion efforts, including that the company will store its customer data locally.   Facebook-owned WhatsApp hired Bose, the co-founder and chief executive of Indian mobile payments firm Ezetap, in late 2018.   Facebook recently invested $5.7 billion for a 10 percent stake in Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, as Big Tech expands in India . The growing Indian conglomerate is run by Mukesh Ambani, said to be India\u2019s wealthiest person.   Facebook is on the move in Brazil as well. For example, the social media giant has partnered with Mastercard   to offer Brazilians a way to send and receive money on the social network\u2019s WhatsApp.   Cardholders who make bank transactions with two Brazilian banks, Nubank and Sicredi, will be the first to use the tool on WhatsApp, which allows users to send text and voice messages \u2014 and money. By using Mastercard Send, WhatsApp users can have their phones transfer money instantly. That\u2019s become more desirable as consumers seek other ways of paying without touch, due to coronavirus fears.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs.

I will see you next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Brian Stelter. It's time for RELIABLE SOURCE, our weekly look at the story behind the story. Of how the media really works, how the news gets made, and how all of us can help make it better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A lot ahead this hour. Looking at the post-Mueller media landscape. Right wing outlets are warning the border. Left wing outlets are more worried about health care. We'll talk about that coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, a fresh face on the campaign trail with Mayor Pete Buttigieg standing out from the 2020 pack. His top communications adviser will join me live to talk media strategy.</p><p>And later, a big announcement being broken here on RELIABLE SOURCES from one of America's best known foundations. It's a local news rescue mission, coming up.</p><p>But, President Trump right now celebrating Robert Mueller's no collusion conclusion. He's celebrating by condemning the press. He's repeating a Fox News talking point.</p><p>You can see it right here. It says \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post's\" Pulitzer Prizes for Russia coverage should be taken away. Fake, he says.</p><p>But the papers were actually honored for covering Russia's real 2016 attack against the U.S. election and for covering Trump world's connections to Russia. All that was real news.</p><p>But there's also been an enormous amount of speculation in the past two and a half years about collusion and even worse. There has been a reckoning in the past week about the media's coverage of these issues.</p><p>And yet, we're still kind of in the dark. I mean, remember that headline there. The Mueller report is more than 300 pages long. So far, we've only seen 101 words.</p><p>So there's a lot to dissect. I want to do it with four insiders from all different points of view about the news coverage.</p><p>Here to debrief, White House correspondent for \"The Atlantic\" and a CNN political analyst, Elaina Plott, senior politics reporter for \"Vox\", Jane Coaston, \"New York Times\" opinion columnist Farhad Manjoo, and here with me in New York, Republican strategist and CNN political commentator, Alice Stewart.</p><p>hank you all for coming on today.</p><p>Elaina, let me start with you. You've been reporting on the president's media criticisms and his attacks in the past week. There have been a lot of calls from right wing media for accountability, for apologies.</p><p>Do you think anyone is going to step up and apologize for their coverage of the Mueller probe?</p><p>ELAINA PLOTT, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think apologies are necessary. I do think that would look a bit silly. But I do think reporters, at this point, if they don't recognize a tonal shift is in order after what many, I think, rightfully perceive to be a pretty big mess up in their coverage of Mueller's investigation, you know, I think that's an issue.</p><p>So I think rather than having the media get in an defensive crouch, they should look at the fact that a lot of journalists actually when Barr's summary came out seemed disappointed. And that's the kind of tonal shift that I think is going to cause America's trust in the media to crater.</p><p>STELTER: Disappointed. Jane, do you agree there was disappointment when the summary from Barr came out?</p><p>JANE COASTON, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, VOX: I think somewhat, because I think that as journalists, this was an interesting story to cover. You know, it had a foreign policy element. It had kind of the spy craft element that I think a lot of people were intrigued by.</p><p>But you did get the sense that people were weirdly being disappointed they finding out that the president of the United States had not been, as far as we know, colluding with the foreign power, and I think that that really reflects how invested people, even people within the media became in the Mueller investigation as an overall story arc.</p><p>STELTER: I think others were relieved not disappointed. Relieved there wasn't evidence of a wide ranging conspiracy. Yet aren't we seeing, especially from the left, calls to wait for the real full report. I'm worried right now that new conspiracy theories are festering in the darkness because we haven't seen the full report.</p><p>Alice, is that something that you've seen as well?</p><p>ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think initially we did see people come out of the gates saying this is good news. This is a reward for America or good news for America and its president that our president and his presidential campaign was not colluding with the Russian government. Initially, that's what we're seeing.</p><p>I hope, and I've been saying this from day one, let's not prejudge what Robert Mueller is doing. Let's wait until we get the full report. While we have a summary from Bill Barr, I think we still need to wait until we can get the full report out to make a more accurate conclusion as to what happened.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>STEWART: But, initially, yes, I was pleased to see a lot of those in the media, the mainstream media, conservative and liberal, saying this is good news for the president. We need to continue to focus on that.</p><p>But in terms of anticipating what the full details of the Mueller report, I think we still need to, again, wait until we see that.</p><p>STELTER: And the years before you became a strategies, you were a journalist working in television. I wonder if the television strategy about the president has been put out his version of the story, put out the Trump administration's version of the story, and then in a few weeks we'll see the Mueller report.</p><p>[11:05:03] By then, his framing will be baked in.</p><p>STEWART: It will with his base. Look, all along, you can travel around this country. His base never bought into the collusion story.</p><p>They never believed that he was involved. They believed exactly what the president said. No collusion with Russia. And that is an important for many people to certainly keep in mind.</p><p>And as the Barr summary came out, they recognized the fact that, look, there has been no evidence that there was this campaign conspired with Russia. They did not coordinate with them. While some of the actions they did might not have been very well thought out. In my view, sometimes it was based on not being very educated on campaigns and things most campaigns wouldn't do.</p><p>It did not result in anything that should result in criminal charges. I think that's what many people need to take away from this.</p><p>STELTER: And to that point, Alice -- Farhad Manjoo at \"The Times\", you wrote a column this week that set out to be among the thousands of columns written. The headline says \"Collusion was a selective delusion\", seductive delusion.</p><p>What's your argument here?</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, OPINION COLUMNIST, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I mean, I think for many liberals and many in the establishment, you know, especially in the Democratic establishment, collusion offered this kind of undue button, this convenient undo button, this possibility that maybe Donald Trump wasn't elected, you know, fairly and legitimately, and maybe we didn't have to examine some of the problems that happened in the 2016 election.</p><p>I mean, I think the real problem here in kind of investing everything in the Mueller investigation was we took our eye off the real problems in 2016. You know, voter suppression, you know, the fact we had another presidential election where the winner of the popular vote didn't become president -- the huge mistakes that the Hillary Clinton campaign made, and the mistakes of the media itself. We in the media focused on Hillary Clinton's e-mails to a degree that was unnecessary and, you know, for everyone involved, the Mueller investigation was a convenient pivot to say, you know, maybe Putin did it and if Putin did it, we wouldn't have to focus on the deeper and more challenging problems that we have in America in, you know, in democracy and voting for presidents.</p><p>STELTER: So, your message going forward is what?</p><p>MANJOO: I mean, I think it's important to wait for the Mueller report, but I still -- I think we should just completely down play, you know, how much we invest in what happens with Mueller. I mean, the real problems in America can be solved in the next, you know, we'll look at it in the next two years of campaigning for the 2020 election, and I think, you know, the Democrats who are running for president are smart to be pivoting away from Mueller. I mean, many of them didn't invest a lot in talking about Mueller because it was, you know, it was this kind of vague and background noise.</p><p>I think with a lot of Americans, you know, don't care. Weren't that interested. It's important that Russia interfered in our election and for a national security implications and other things, people should focus on that. I don't think it's the big story for the next year and a half and I hope that the media and, you know, politicians kind of pivot away from Mueller and all that is in that report.</p><p>STELTER: And here is the new narrative we're hearing from hosts on Fox News. Let me play this montage from this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: You have been lied to by other networks and the news media on a spectacular level for years and years.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: When will the liberal media apologize?</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: They completely terrified the population. They should be punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Not sure what he means by punished. Not sure what the punishment would be in a free press and open society. But, Elaina, is this a kind of preview with the strategy will be for the next 18 months all the way through 2020?</p><p>PLOTT: Yes, Brian, as I reported this week, you know, the pro Trump super PAC America First and the Republican National Committee, there are conversations underway right now about the ways in which that operatives there can use past clips, past tweets, past statements from reporters who spoke about collusion as though it were a given and there were, you know, it was no room for error there, ways in which they can use that if a reporter to say something negative about Trump blasting that immediately.</p><p>And actually, Brian, I'm told you're one of the primary targets for that. So, you might want to look out. I guess what I mean to say is by conflating the media with the elite, Trump gets to play into the us versus them mentality that allowed him to coast to victory in 2016, and I think it's incumbent upon reporters not to take the bait, like I said, get in that defensive crouch and instead do their jobs, report the news, and not let this campaign bait them into one versus the other.</p><p>[11:10:11] STELTER: Yes. Look, I know I'm a convenient hate object for a right wing media. I recognize that. And I usually just blow it off.</p><p>But I think there's something important throughout this conversation that I want to emphasize. Something you said, Jane, off-air, you said, sometimes the biggest stories involving the president and the administration they're happening in plain sight.</p><p>COASTON: Right.</p><p>STELTER: It doesn't require a two-year-long investigation.</p><p>COASTON: Right, exactly. You know, we could talk about Trump's pick for the fed as being, you know, called radically under qualified by both conservatives and liberals. We could talk about what is taking place in Puerto Rico and how Trump has played into Puerto Rico not receiving the aid it needs.</p><p>These are things that are happening now. You know, it doesn't require, like, an HBO series on spy craft or any sort of collusion or a federal investigation to understand that the Trump administration is underserving a whole number of Americans, including many of the Americans who voted for this administration.</p><p>We should be talking about agricultural subsidizes and the issues farmers are having. We should be talking about the environment. There are a lot of issues we can be talking about that I think are less convenient both for this administration and for the media, because I think occasionally it turns into a weird tennis match between the media and the Trump administration that everyone actually kind of enjoys while there are a lot of issues we aren't talking about that matter to Americans who vote, and those who don't.</p><p>STELTER: Yes. Alice, let's take one moment to have a journalism class here. What is the lesson? What is the takeaway that you would be teaching in this class?</p><p>STEWART: My takeaway from this is we can all take a step back from the last two years, whether you're part of politics or you're in the media. And let's take this as an opportunity to learn. Let's make sure that as a journalist, having been one before, I subscribe to the contractor rule of measure twice, cut once.</p><p>And as journalist, double check or triple source check your facts before you go to print. Oftentimes, and I experience this often in campaigns, a journalist in the rush to beat their competitors, and in a rush to get their story out there online, they put something out there and realize it's not factually accurate and pull it back. But by then it's taken on a life of its own.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>STEWART: It's all over the Twitter sphere and online and it's stories have been picked up.</p><p>So, I think as journalists, this is an opportunity to learn, let's make sure we have our facts accurate and correct on the front end and focus on the things that this administration wants to push. There are positive things to talk about, jobs and the economy. And what we're doing with -- remember, what happened to infrastructure week? That never got --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>STEWART: Let me say, there's an opioid crisis, there's things we're doing for criminal justice reform. I can't remember how many times those were big stories of success this administration was working on and there was just ad nauseam coverage of this Mueller report we didn't know the facts on. So, I think from both sides we can learn. And from the administration side --</p><p>STELTER: We say it all the time -- less speculating, more reporting. It's easy to say. It's hard to put into practice but less speculating and more reporting is a good thing. There were mistakes made in the coverage of this Russia report.</p><p>But there were tremendous investigative reports out there. There was a lot to investigate. I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water here.</p><p>STEWART: Look, both sides. I don't think this president is doing anyone any favors by referring to all the news media as fake news and saying that the media is the enemy of the people. That doesn't help the situation.</p><p>And if they want to talk about the positive aspects of this administration, which there are so many to talk about, then there doesn't need to be tweets about witch hunts and fake news media. So if there is on both sides a little more restraint on one side with regard to pointing the fingers at the media and, in my view, a little bit more fact checking on the part of the media, I think that we'll have learned a big lesson from all of this.</p><p>STELTER: To our panel, thank you so much, everybody, for being here, for being a start of this hour. You know, the only network that actually has apologized for something this week is Fox News. I'm going to show you what they're apologizing for in just a moment.</p><p>Plus, Susan Glasser will join me with her big takeaway from this Trump rally. That's in just a moment.</p><p>[11:18:26] STELTER: Hey, welcome back.</p><p>If President Trump was watching Lou Dobbs the other night, he heard that foreigners may kill millions of Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\": Just literally put out welcome wagons. Pile them high because, you know, we're going to consign tens of thousands, perhaps millions of Americans to their deaths.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Terrifying, right? That's the whole point. It's nonsense but it's scary.</p><p>You know, the president praised his Fox friends several times this week. He even got on the phone with Sean Hannity and chatted for 45 minutes and said he hoped Jeanine Pirro would be back soon. Pirro's suspension was scheduled to be over, it is over. She was back on the air on Saturday night, and if the president was watching, he heard that his opponents should be jailed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: You stood witness to the biggest scandal in American history bar none, the attempted coup of the United States government. This is bound to happen again unless we stop them. And the only way to stop them is with justice -- true justice. And that's behind the bars justice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: I don't know what to say.</p><p>And if the president was watching \"Fox &amp; Friends\" this morning, he saw this banner. It says: Trump cuts U.S. aid to three Mexican countries. The reference, of course, to Central American countries.</p><p>The network apologized several hours later and said the banner never should have appeared.</p><p>[11:20:01] Obviously, that's the case. But I don't know what is going on over there.</p><p>Look, let's talk about what it means for the president to be watching this kind of programming, what it means for him to be getting this information, and what it means for him to have one heck of a week.</p><p>Let me bring in Susan Glasser. She is, of course, the author of Trump's Washington column for the \"New Yorker\" and she's a CNN global affairs analyst.</p><p>Susan, I think 20 times in the last two years we've heard something about Trump's worst week ever. I think it's probably fair to say this was his best week ever, yes?</p><p>SUSAN GLASSER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, there's no question starting with that late Sunday afternoon release of the Barr letter. He doesn't want us to call it a summary. But the Barr letter announcing that Robert Mueller had found no -- had not established any reason to proceed on any collusion or conspiracy between Trump and Russia. You know, Trump has been telling us and defining the stakes in this investigation for nearly two years as no collusion.</p><p>And on Sunday, his attorney general said there was no collusion. So, you know, that should have been his greatest week. But I think you and I and many other people were struck by the fact that Donald Trump is still Donald Trump. Win or lose, he's the same public persona, angry, vindictive, and, also, clearly somewhat relieved this week.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, not only does the Barr summary come out, Barr letter come out, Michael Avenatti gets arrested. There's a culture war story the president waded into about Jussie Smollett. All the stories to stoke fires and yet the president is still angry. He seems really angry.</p><p>GLASSER: Well, that's right. I called it our president of the perpetual grievance in my \"New Yorker\" column. And I think it's key to understanding his public persona and his private persona. People who have spent a long time studying the president's biography, his personal history, have incredible number of stories going all the way back in his career, long predating his entry into politics in which winning was never enough for Trump.</p><p>He often has had a habit of over reaching when he went either other mischaracterizing the nature of his victory, which is something he did right away, remember on Sunday when he said he was completely and totally exonerated, which literally the language in the letter said he was not exonerated on obstruction of justice. But, also, just he really -- he takes it personally those who oppose him. And he seeks to want to defeat them.</p><p>You see him now attacking those who have called for the investigation demeaning the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee with nicknames, things like that, things that would have been unthinkable, of course, in any other presidency.</p><p>STELTER: And we have to remind folks of that. I think many Americans know it, but we've got to keep reminding, this is all unthinkable. The president's number of lies this week is shocking by any standard.</p><p>And yet he keeps telling the same story over and over again, right? He was doing it about Mueller. He's doing it about the border, as well. I've noticed the divide in the news coverage now. One side is really focused on the border situation. The other side focused on Trump trying to take away Obamacare. These are probably two narratives that are going to continue in the weeks to come.</p><p>But the existence of Fox as a repeater of his narrative over and over again, I just think those clips I was playing in the intro underscore how powerful it is for him. That he has this megaphone.</p><p>GLASSER: Well, that's right. You know, my colleague, Jane Mayer, has obviously done incredible reporting, helping to understand this feedback between Trump and Fox in an almost seamless way, in which it operates.</p><p>If you listen to the president's Grand Rapids rally the other night, to me, it's amazing when he starts to call out -- he attacks the fake news media, as you know, quote/unquote, repeatedly, he did so in a direct way the other day, blamed them for the greatest political hoax in American history.</p><p>But at the same time, he also calls out the Fox hosts as if he was actually a part of the Fox line up. And I'm always amused by that.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>GLASSER: He's on a first-name basis with them. And he goes down and he says, well, of course, Sean and Tucker and, you know, he goes on and on about the Fox line up in a way as if he was a paid promoter of the network in his public appearances.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, he fills in as a Fox News PR person. He really does. He also credited the network's ratings which have been high since the Barr letter came out. We can put the \"Washington Post\" headline up on screen about the TV ratings being one barometer for Trump's success.</p><p>Do you think with these anti-media, anti-journalism messages coming out of Fox's prime time line up every day to 3 million to 5 million people, is it doing damage to the press's credibility?</p><p>GLASSER: No question. If you just -- it's graphic. You look at the numbers over the press's institutional credibility, it has gone down dramatically. By this is a turn that predates Donald Trump, as with many of the ongoing sort of political disruptions in our national life. Trump is an amplifier and accelerator of those trends rather than an originator of them.</p><p>[11:25:05] I think that's true for the attacks on the media as well.</p><p>And, by the way, Trump just likes to find things that work for him. He said something revealing the other day along those lines. He said, you know, they like it when you attack the press.</p><p>And so, you know, is he doing it because it works for him politically? Or because it's something he believes. Who knows? But, you know, we do know that Donald Trump is somebody who likes and needs an enemy and from the beginning of his administration, that's been a tactic.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>GLASSER: So, there was nobody, right, who was surprised that his response to the Mueller findings as reported by Barr this week that he was going to attack the media.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>GLASSER: There was nobody -- what it unfortunately means, they're conflating, you know, lots of terrific reporting out there by the \"Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\" and other news outlets with every kind of statement and characterization and speculation surrounding the investigation, as well. That's very bad news, I think, for the media.</p><p>STELTER: Right. Conflating investigative journalists with idiot resistance Twitters is a time honored tactic of the president's media allies. It's cynical, it's ridiculous but it's effective for them.</p><p>GLASSER: Well, that's right. And by the way, it's tactic of right and left. I think you saw some left commentary, as well, beating up on legitimate journalism and conflating it in irresponsible ways.</p><p>STELTER: That's a good point, yes.</p><p>GLASSER: And people, by the way, so eager to over correct. You know, these are complicated subject which is why I have been awaiting the Mueller report for the last couple of years. And I do hope that, you know, we're journalists. We always vote for as much to be released as possible.</p><p>But I think in this case, it's particularly important because the credibility of the conclusions are at stake in this incredibly divided political atmosphere.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>GLASSER: There are many disturbing data points. I would like somebody who is responsible and not partisan to be able to stitch them together for me in a way that we have not yet had.</p><p>STELTER: Susan Glasser, thanks so much for being here. Great talking with you.</p><p>GLASSER: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is gaining momentum, rising in the polls. We're going to speak with his top communications advisor about the media strategy, right after this.</p><p>[11:30:00] BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter. And here's a funny headline from the front page of the New York Times this week. It says he's caught on with voters however they say his name. The person of course is Pete Buttigieg, others say Pete Buttigieg. He says he doesn't care what you call him. Here's what he does care about though.</p><p>Buttigieg is rising in the polls. Crystals of the day say he's the hottest candidate out there right now. And Buttigieg has been making the T.V. rounds. you might have seen him on Real Time with Bill Maher, or The View, or Colbert, or here on the Van Jones Show. So how did someone who was virtually unknown a few months ago get to this point?</p><p>Let's talk media strategy. Lis Smith is the Top Communications Advisor to the Mayor and she's with me here. You've been working with Mayor Pete as he says he likes to be called for what, a couple of years now.</p><p>LIS SMITH, COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER TO PETE BUTTIGIEG: Yes. 2 1/2 years since right before he announced for dance teacher.</p><p>STELTER: And right now he's officially only exploring a presidential run. What have you done in the past few months to try to raise his profile?</p><p>SMITH: Well, look, we started this race and he started this race as a virtual unknown. You know he's a 37-year-old mayor from the industrial west and those aren't the people that are going to be on the front page of the New York Times or featured wall-to-wall on CNN. But throughout career, he's always been a very open, accessible, transparent leader, and it was important for us to be open, accessible, and transparent with the media and to get him everywhere.</p><p>You know, one problem that I' see in politics, I've worked on a lot of campaigns and you know, you've covered them certainly is that there is a polarization in the media atmosphere and you know, you do see this trend of Democrats just going to talk on MSNBC, Republicans just going to talk on Fox, and then maybe some cross-pollination at CNN.</p><p>And what's important to us is to go and talk to people everywhere, talk to them where they are. You know, he was the first candidate to go on Fox News Sunday.</p><p>STELTER: The first Dem to the 2020 lineup.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, the first -- yes, first Democratic.</p><p>STELTER: And why that choice to go on Chris Wallace's show?</p><p>SMITH: Because we need to be talking to everyone. Even if we don't agree with the folks on everything, I think it's important to go out, get your message out there, but also treat people with differing opinions with respect.</p><p>STELTER: And does he feel it was a mistake for the DNC to say we're not going to have any debates on Fox News?</p><p>SMITH: No, look, he'll use that stuff to the DNC. I can only speak to our strategy and our strategy is to get him out there everywhere even with people who disagrees with and --</p><p>STELTER: What are the underappreciated media venues or outlets? You know, I know The View matters --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>STELTER: I know Colbert matters. What are the ones that you think also are important to the Dems in the primary?</p><p>SMITH: Well, you know, podcasts are really hot right now and I think underappreciated. And there's a wide range of them. Look we got him on The Intercept on I think it was one of their most downloaded podcasts. We got him on The Breakfast Club. We got him on Preet Bharara's podcast. And these things all have very unique different audiences and it speaks to his range and his ability that he's willing to do it. And I think people give you points for being willing to be creative.</p><p>You know. we had him on the West Wing weekly show which is not exactly a normal stop for a 2020 potential candidate.</p><p>STELTER: It does remind me of the competition in 2016 about President Trump, then-Candidate Trump being available, being accessible. He's not these days but he used to call into show.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. And I think if you or someone that is comfortable in who you are, comfortable in your own skin, and that is something that Mayor Pete definitely is, it makes sense to get out there. And people are so sick of the artifice and the bluster in politics.</p><p>I mean, we've got this carnival barker in the White House and on the other side you have people who just rely on these very tightly scripted poll-tested lines. And people are you know, can read through that. They can see the artifice.</p><p>I think what they like about him is that he's someone who listens, he engages, and he's not running or you know, not potentially running just to potentially run. He's running because he has a message, he has a vision, and he's always been motivated by a sense of service. That's what you know let him to volunteer -- to go to Afghanistan, to run for Mayor of South Bend, when it was named one of the ten dying cities, and that's you know, I think that's what's compelled him to get in this race.</p><p>[11:35:30] STELTER: These headlines, these polls, there's been a lot of headlines in the past week about him rising in the polls. What do you do about peaking too early? Do you worry about this press perception that he has nowhere to go but -- you know, anymore because he has already risen?</p><p>SMITH: Right. Well, that's what I think what we like to call champagne problems. You know, peaking too early is better than not peaking at all. And what's important is being able to sustain the momentum. And you sure, people in the political bubble have gotten to know Mayor Pete but it needs to trickle down to everyone. And it -- and I really do believe that the more people see him the more they will like him.</p><p>STELTER: And how do you pronounce his last name? How do you personally --</p><p>SMITH: Buttigieg.</p><p>STELTER: OK. All right.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. It's really easy.</p><p>STELTER: I think journalists are still trying to get the hang of it.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, you know. Most people are not familiar with Maltese last names and that's cool. And a lot of people are like well, is this going to hinder him? I actually think it creates some buzz and makes it interesting and as he says, you just kind of -- you don't have to pronounce it just pick him out of a lineup on a ballot.</p><p>STELTER: I see. Lis, thanks for being.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, thank you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER: Good to see you.</p><p>SMITH: Good to see you.</p><p>SMITH: A quick break here and then a question about the lack of press briefings. There's a lack of press briefings not just in the White House but also at other parts -- within other parts of the government. For example there at the Pentagon. CNN's Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr joins me from there in just a moment.</p><p>[11:40:00] STELTER: The T.V. to Trump revolving door keeps turning. Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus is the latest example. She's expected to be named the State Department's Spokesperson. She would be replacing another former Fox News personality, Heather Nauert.</p><p>For now, Ortagus is out at Fox but not yet in its state. But she's not the only one. Stephen Moore for example, a regular here on CNN. He's out at CNN as you know because he's up for a Fed seat. There's also former Fox News reporter Lea Gabrielle. She's joining the State Department in a key role. And Marc Short who was at the White House, then joined CNN, then went back to the White House. Now he's V.P. Mike Pence's chief of staff.</p><p>Just four examples of that revolving door. Even though it does spin around and around, there hasn't been much openness we've seen and that is not just at the White House. Of course, it has been 20 days since the last White House on-camera press briefing. Remember, these used to be held daily, now their monthly if we're lucky.</p><p>But that's not the only place who has a lack of briefings. Over at the Pentagon, it's been 304 days without an on-camera briefing. Why is that? What's going on over there? Let's ask Barbara Starr. She is CNN's Pentagon Correspondent and she's joining me from there now.</p><p>Barbara, I didn't know that there'd been this kind of blackout for so long. What kind of access do you experience there?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, blackout extraordinaire, Brian. I mean, more than 300 days. The last on- camera briefing by a Pentagon spokesperson was last May last year. And so what has happened here is they have shifted of their own free will in this administration to off-camera briefings.</p><p>We have people who will come down and conduct single-subject briefings, off-camera briefings. The secretary, Secretary Mattis, and now Acting Secretary Shanahan will occasionally do on-camera especially when they travel but they're very short. They only take a few questions. So what is happening is nothing.</p><p>The problem, of course, is always the same. There is no spokesman that goes on a podium and subjects themselves to rigorous questioning from a press corps. Any and all questions all comers. It is not happening and really I think what is suffering very greatly is the flow of public information and that's what this is all about.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, the worse continue but access there does seem to be restricted. And by the way, we've seen this at the White House where Sean Spicer and then Sarah Sanders is sometimes they were worried about what the President was going to think at the briefings. You know, they'd even wear the certain kind of tie and Spicer's case. Is there something similar going on the Pentagon where there's concern about catching Trump's attention?</p><p>STARR: Yes, totally. I mean, so first you have no civilian political appointee spokesperson because they're afraid of upsetting the president. But then of course what has also happened here, when is the last time you saw a four-star general admiral get on a podium in front of the camera and take questions from the press corps about what their troops are doing, how capable the U.S. military is.</p><p>You see them testifying about all of that before Congress but not in front of the press corps. And you know, rip the Band-Aid off. It is 100 percent we know this because they are concerned about getting crosswise with the president and because every day when they come into work, and these are the most senior commanders, they don't know what the president's going to say.</p><p>You know, a lot of times off-camera in the hallways here at the Pentagon, you get the sort of shrugging shoulders, what's he done now, literal words that you hear. They don't know what the president is going to say so they are very nervous, full of anxiety about going out there speaking publicly, getting crosswise with him.</p><p>And if they get crosswise with him they may lose their influence in the decision-making in the national security process. so everybody's nervous, everybody's full of anxiety, but it's the American public that's not getting information.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, stressful times and I hope the on-camera briefings can make a return. Barbara, thank you for being here. Great to see you.</p><p>STARR: Sure. STELTER: Up next here, Mark Zuckerberg in a brand new op-ed saying the internet needs new rules. But what are they going to be? And is Facebook really doing enough to kind of stem online radicalization? We're going to get into that in just a moment.</p><p>[11:45:00] STETLER: Online radicalization, we saw it again in New Zealand earlier this month. Every month, actually every day there's more and more pressure on big tech to account for the consequences of their creations. So this weekend, Mark Zuckerberg is out with an op- ed outlining what he thinks government regulators should do.</p><p>He admits Facebook has a responsibility to keep people safe on its services, and there been a lot of developments in the path week about this. About Facebook and other tech companies saying they are stepping up to the plate.</p><p>Now, Taylor Lorenz is here. She's a Staff Writer of the Atlantic who's been covering this extensively. She has a new piece about Instagram, Facebook's Instagram being a new home for hate. But first Taylor, this news that was announced couple days ago, Facebook says it's going to ban white nationalism. How do you -- how do you ban a racist idea?</p><p>TAYLOR LORENZ, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC: Well, they've had a lot of fun with this before. I mean, actually white supremacy was previously banned too. This is something that they've actually promised to crack down on repeatedly over the past few years. But it's really hard to moderate this type of content.</p><p>And you know, right now they rely on a huge force of you know, contract workers to go through a lot of this stuff. They say that AI is going to be able to detect it. But you know, there's a lot of nuance and regulating you know this type of speech and it's ever- evolving.</p><p>[11:50:10] STELTER: Yes. They say they'll ban support for white nationalism. We'll see if they're able to. But you've been pointing out that Instagram, Facebook's normally you know, friendlier part of the company, there's a lot of nastiness and misinformation on Instagram and I think it's underappreciated. But what do you think is most important to understand about Instagram?</p><p>LORENZ: Well, I think there's a big misconception that it is this friendly, sunny, nice place.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>LORENZ: I mean, I think it's -- I mean, I'm sure you and I, it's like you used to follow your friends, family, much in the way that people did initially on Facebook too, right. You go there to connect with people you know, then you go there you know to look for more ideas. It's -- especially for young people really where they go to form their identity, find news information about you know breaking news events and stuff like that. So -- and it's growing it's growing you know by the day. It's because -- it's a far more culturally relevant platform than Facebook.</p><p>STELTER: But when I searched the term vaccine, I see all this anti- vaccine misinformation right on Instagram.</p><p>LORENZ: Oh yes. And it's not even just searching the term. I mean, you can follow you know anti-vac account that's served you. And Instagram's recommendation algorithm will actually try to push more and more and more of that content on you.</p><p>So it's not even just blocking a hashtag, its revamping and figuring out you know, working moderation into the algorithm, into the recommendation algorithm.</p><p>STELTER: That's ultimately what all of this is all about, right? For folks who haven't heard this, what does it mean that the algorithm radicalizes people?</p><p>LORENZ: Yes, I know. It sounds scary because you hear this word algorithm. But there is no one -- you know, there is no one big algorithm. But essentially what all of these you know, platforms do is try to surface you more content that you're going to be interested in. A lot of times they optimized for engagement and radical ideas.</p><p>And so it's not so much people searching out stuff but more that they're fed on progressively more extremists.</p><p>STELTER: Down the so-called rabbit hole.</p><p>LORENZ: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: It's whether you're on YouTube, or Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, but it's a huge problem on YouTube right now.</p><p>LORENZ: Oh yes.</p><p>STELTER: That you go down this rabbit hole as a result of the recommendation engine. Do you think any of these companies is really addressing that fully?</p><p>LORENZ: I don't think any of these attack CEOs really you know understand the breadth of the problem. And I'm sympathetic to them in the sense that what they -- I don't think they've realized what they've created. But this is -- you know, this criticism has been lobbied against them for years. So this is not the first time you know, that people are pointing out some of these issues.</p><p>We saw a lot of criticism two years ago, the 2016 election. So they've had years to figure this out and they need to be taking it far more seriously than they are now for sure.</p><p>STELTER: You can read Taylor's piece at the TheAtlantic.com. Taylor, thanks for being here.</p><p>LORENZ: Thanks for having me. STELTER: A quick break here, and then talking about some of the impacts of technology on the news business. We all know about the woes, the troubles of local news. I hear about a brand new investment trying to turn the tide right after this.</p><p>[11:55:00] STELTER: So many headlines so often here on this program and elsewhere about the troubles of local news. But there's a lot of investment going on and here is one example. The Knight Foundation has committed $300 million to a news initiative focusing on local news and on startups that are trying to make a difference.</p><p>Today they're announcing another $6 million that they're allotting to three different programs. So let's get right to it with Knight Foundation Chief Executive Alberto Ibarguen. He's joining me here in New York. What's the ultimate goal of this $300 million commitment to try to reshape news?</p><p>ALBERTO IBARGUEN, CEO, KNIGHT FOUNDATION: Look, they're really two basic goals. One is to reimagine local news in a way that is sustainable as a -- as a business, as a nonprofit. We're experimenting with lots of different things. But in a bigger way, what we're really trying to do is to figure out how we regain trust.</p><p>This is the big crisis in democracy in America today. There is a fundamental lack of trust in institutions. So where can you best find trust? In the people you know and the people you're closest to. The people who write the stories that you know something about.</p><p>And if somebody writes something -- I live Miami. If somebody writes something about Hialeah and Homestead as two neighborhoods in Miami, I know they don't know what they're talking about because these are two different worlds.</p><p>That kind of local news is verifiable in an instinctive sort of way and we want to get back to that. We want to get back to feeding the middle where we can agree on the facts and then left and right can come in and interpret it.</p><p>STELTER: And big tech companies say they want to help as well. We can put on screen Facebook committing $300 million, Google committing $300 million. Apple launching a new news subscription service just this week. Are you confident these companies can be part of the solution because a lot of folks blame them for the problems?</p><p>You know, you look at digital ad dollars. You can put on screen how Google and Facebook eat up most of the digital ad dollars in America. Isn't that part of the problem?</p><p>IBARGUEN: I think they're absolutely part of the problem and they're absolutely part of the solution. Who knows more -- who invests more in technology than these companies do? Our investments at the MIT Media Lab are significant for us but puny for any one of the companies you just mentioned. Facebook is looking at some structural issues. Look at Zuckerberg op- ed talking about what kind of regulation is necessary. Google is looking at what businesses, what business practices might work. We're trying to do a little bit of both of those and we're also funding the actual journalism and the legal support for those journalists that often will kill a story.</p><p>STELTER: And that's also essential.

It is also exploring the intersection of tech and politics, helping readers understand the enormous and increasing impact of technology on finance, markets and society. It now has tech reporters located around the world. </p><p>Moore was previously UK news editor and leisure industries correspondent for the FT before becoming tech news editor this summer. He joined the FT in April 2015 fromTelegraphMedia Group, where he was deputy head of world news and a correspondent in Beijing and Shanghai. He was thewinner of the 2012 Foreign Press Association award for news story of the year.Moore was also a Rome correspondent, an economics correspondent and a business reporter for theTelegraph. Moore spoke Thursday morning with Talking Biz News about the increased tech coverage efforts. What follows is an edited transcript. What was the genesis for the decision to expand tech coverage? It came from two different areas. One was a structural thing, and one was a coverage related thing. On the structural side, our bosses sometime last yer went around the newsrooms of all of our competitors, such as the New York Times, and went to see other publications like BuzzFeed and Vox. We've always organized our newsroom in newspaper sections. We have four big sections \u2014 UK, the world, markets and companies. Those are the four sections that the FT has always organized its newsroom around. But when they went to competitors they saw that the newsrooms were organized by topics, such as politics or business or tech. And they thought, that was an interesting idea.As the same time, we have wanted to do more with tech. It has been under the aegis of companies, and we have had very strong coverage of the big tech companies. But as it spilled out of Silicon Valley into other sectors and started to have a bigger impact on people's lives, and we've seen government and regulatory agencies react to that, it has become a bigger story. So we wanted a more holistic version of the space. So that is basically the background of the two rationales. What interested you in the position? My background is as a foreign correspondent. I spent some time in Italy and a long time in China. I came back to England at the end of 2014. In China, I didn't directly cover the tech industry, but you could see the changes going on there and the impact in people's lives. So that was one thing I was always interested in. When I returned to England, I was put in charge of the UK news desk, so I spent the last three years looking at UK politics and Brexit and it's been an amazing story. I wouldn't say it's been a very good news story. It's been a pretty relentless bad news story. So when my boss came to say would you think about tech coverage, I thought that was a good news story because it was about progress and change. How big is the team covering tech? Looking at our global footprint, in Silicon Valley we have five people and we're hoping to expand there. We're hoping to have someone in DC shortly to look at the intersection of government and tech. In the UK, we have three reporters and we have a couple of editors. And we will have an editor called a creative producer thinking about new formats of storytelling. And in Brussels we have two people. We also have reporters in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. And we have somebody in India. Across the world, we are pretty well resourced. With the new page on the website and the app, is there also a dedicated page in the print paper? There is no dedicated page in print. One of the things that attracted me to this job was that I wouldn't have to think about the printed paper any more. I am absolutely dyed-in-the-wool print generation, and I have always cared deeply about the print newspaper. But having spent quite a lot of energy about how the pages are going to look as UK news editor, it was a huge amount of mental energy going into that process. But the larger part of our readers are online, and I am much keener about fine-tuning the online product and that we have it absolutely where it needs to be. Whatever we publish online, they take it if they want it, and they put it where they want it in the print paper. What are some of the big tech topics that the FT is now giving more coverage to? In thinking about where to position ourselves, we have done a few things. We have asked our readers who read tech stories in the FT what other sources they read. What has come back to us is that they read tech stores in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist and Wired. Those are the four big names. So we're trying to be competitive with those four, but also define a real FT space for our coverage. What do we do that makes us stand out for all the excellent tech coverage that is out there? The terrain that we want to compete on is that we want to be global. We have a fantastic team of reporters, and we connect them together and tell stories across other sector specialists. Self-driving cars is a tech story, but it's also an automobile story. The second thing is that I think we can really carve out a space on the intersection of government and tech. We have broken a lot of stories out of Brussels. I think we have been ahead of the curve there, and we're hoping to strengthen our position in DC. We're a financial publication, so we will follow the money. We have very good ties to finance. So we're going to build up our venture capital reporting team to show our readers where the money is going. Beside the four you mentioned, who do you see as competitors for global tech news coverage? I think there are some really interesting publications out there. One that we think has an interesting approach is The Information. They take a very focused approach, and they're not trying to cover every story. The ones that they do are deeply reported and have a lot of impact. We like what they're doing. A lot of media cover tech. How does the FT make its coverage stand apart beside being global? The key thing for us it to serve our subscribers. Our subscriber come to us because they like what the FT does. They like how the FT reports things. They like how we can explain where the money is going, and they like how we can explain the politics behind things. If we do that in our tech coverage, then we'll stand out. Is the FT still hiring tech reporters? The DC person is about to arrive. We're hoping to add someone in San Francisco to cover venture capital. Other than that, I'm not sure I'm allowed to say. That's above my pay grade. This is a big change for the FT internally. I hope it's going to make a big splash externally as well.

He may have gotten too close.</p><p>To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\"/>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Audm for iPhone or Android</url>.</p><p>Last Nov. 20, NBC News broke the news that Mark Zuckerberg, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Donald Trump</url> and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Facebook</url> board member, Peter Thiel, had dined together at the White House the previous month. \u201cIt is unclear why the meeting was not made public or what Trump, Zuckerberg and Thiel discussed,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">the report</url> said.</p><p>That was it. Nothing else has emerged since. Not the date, not who arranged the menu, the venue, the seating, not the full guest list. And not whether some kind of deal got done between two of the most powerful men in the world. The news cycle moved on, and the dinner became one of the unsolved mysteries of American power.</p><p>But I was able to pry some of those details loose last week from White House officials along with current and former senior Facebook employees and people they speak to. Most said they would only talk on the condition their names not be used, since the company is not eager to call attention to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s relationship with the president.</p><p>Their accounts painted a picture of an unusual gathering \u2014 something in between a high-stakes state dinner between the leaders of uneasily allied superpowers and the awkward rehearsal dinner before a marriage that has both families a little rattled.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, pulled together the dinner on Oct. 22 on short notice after he learned that Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, would be in Washington for a cryptocurrency hearing on Capitol Hill, a person familiar with the planning said. The dinner, the person said, took place in the Blue Room on the first floor of the White House. The guest list included Mr. Thiel, a Trump supporter, and his husband, Matt Danzeisen; Melania Trump; Mr. Kushner; and Ivanka Trump. The president, a person who has spoken to Mr. Zuckerberg said, did most of the talking. The atmosphere was convivial, another person who got an account of the dinner said.\u00a0Mr. Trump likes billionaires and likes people who are useful to him, and Mr. Zuckerberg right now is both.</p><p>But looming over the private dinner is a question: Did Mr. Trump and Mr. Zuckerberg reach some kind of accommodation? Mr. Zuckerberg needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies. Mr. Trump needs access to Facebook\u2019s advertising platform and its viral power.</p><p>Both men are getting what they want, and it\u2019s fair to wonder whether this is a mere alignment of interests or something more.</p><p>\u201cI believe they have a deal,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor who is now a fierce critic, who added that it was \u201cprobably implied rather than explicit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark\u2019s deal with Trump is highly utilitarian,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about getting free rein and protection from regulation. Trump needs Facebook\u2019s thumb on the scale to win this election.\u201d</p><p>Jesse Lehrich, the co-founder of Accountable Tech, a new nonprofit group pushing Facebook to tighten controls on its platform, suggested that the two men have a tacit nonaggression pact. \u201cTrump can rage at Big Tech and Mark can say he\u2019s disgusted by Trump\u2019s posts, but at the end of the day the status quo serves both of their interests,\u201d Mr. Lehrich said.</p><p>Officials at Facebook and in the administration scoff at the notion that there is some kind of secret pact. And it\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone \u2014 certainly not Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 would be dumb enough to make a secret deal with a president known for keeping neither secrets nor deals.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Zuckerberg had met just once before the dinner, an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Oval Office encounter</url> last September. Afterward, the president boasted about his giant following on the platform. But October was a hot political month at Facebook: Mr. Zuckerberg was in an open battle with a leading Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">threatening to break up Facebook</url> and whom he called \u201can existential threat\u201d to the company. The morning of their dinner, a top British official <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">demanded</url> answers on why Facebook would tolerate false political advertising.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, a Facebook executive said, seems to view Mr. Trump as a peer. By contrast, he told amused top aides at one of his regular Monday meetings in March that Mr. Kushner was calling him so often about help with the administration\u2019s coronavirus response that he couldn\u2019t keep up, two people familiar with the meeting said. (\u201cMark does not think of himself as a peer to this president or any president,\u201d a Facebook spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said, adding that Mr. Zuckerberg had initiated the conversation with Mr. Kushner about the coronavirus response.)</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has played the high-stakes and unpredictable politics of the Trump years as well as any other corporate executive. And a week before the dinner last October, he made clear <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">in a speech</url> that his interests and the president\u2019s aligned: Mr. Zuckerberg would reject a growing movement to limit the false or inflammatory statements of the American president.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\u201d he said in the address at Georgetown University on Oct. 17. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Trump, for his part, has been notably softer on Facebook than on Amazon, Google, Twitter or Netflix at a moment when his regulatory apparatus often focuses on the political enemies he identifies in tweets.</p><p>Still Facebook, like other tech giants, finds itself in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">political bind</url>: Democrats hate and distrust them because they spread right-wing misinformation and helped elect Donald Trump; Republicans hate and distrust them because they\u2019re run by California liberals and delete some right-wing speech. But Facebook has avoided that trap deftly over the last three and a half years, by moving faster and more earnestly than its competitors to mollify conservatives.</p><p>Facebook has always had a keener ear to the right side of Washington than much of Silicon Valley, directed in part by Joel Kaplan, a Zuckerberg friend and former Bush administration official who is Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy. But it began focusing intently on winning over the conservative media in the spring of 2016, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Gizmodo alleged</url> that the content moderation on the short-lived <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">Trending Topics product</url> on Facebook \u201csuppressed conservative news.\u201d A right-wing apparatus that had spent decades claiming bias in the media turned its sights on the tech giant. And Mr. Zuckerberg gave them the response they\u2019d always hoped for \u2014\u00a0he shut down the product, welcomed his critics to meetings and signaled that he shared their concerns.</p><p>The next year, Mr. Trump continued to push the norms of truth and civility, and the social media platforms began reckoning with their broader misinformation and harassment problem. That set him on an inevitable \u2014\u00a0and to his supporters, welcome \u2014\u00a0collision course with the new gatekeepers. Mr. Trump\u2019s dependence on Facebook as an advertising vehicle \u2014\u00a0he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">spent</url> $44 million on the platform in 2016, and is expected to far exceed that this year \u2014 means that he needs the company as much as it needs him. And, as Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, and Cecilia Kang <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">reported in May</url>, Mr. Zuckerberg increasingly embodies his company.</p><p>So Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s warm relationship with the president and his family is a victory for the company\u2019s internal policy team led by Mr. Kaplan. But the company, people involved in its political strategy say, has been having an internal debate over balancing the reality of Republican control of regulatory agencies with the fact that Democrats are far more likely, in the long run, to actually push through new oversight or try to break up the company by forcing the sale of Instagram or WhatsApp. The balance, in the Trump years, has shifted right. Sheryl Sandberg, a leading Democrat and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s powerful deputy, has seen her connections with Democrats fray as the company defies them and her power in the company fades as well.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has reciprocated. The Justice Department is currently conducting antitrust investigations of the tech giants. But while Google and Amazon face \u201cmature investigations,\u201d the Facebook inquiry is \u201cnot real at all,\u201d a person who has been briefed on the investigation said. And Facebook has acted like a company with no worries in Washington. It has continued to acquire companies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">as Mr. Isaac reported last week</url>, and moved to allow users to send messages between Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 a merging of the services that could further fuel monopoly concerns. (Facebook\u2019s view is that it\u2019s far less dominant in any market than the other big tech companies and has less to worry about than Google or Amazon.)</p><p>The summer of 2020 is one of those moments when corporate Washington starts to panic. What had looked like deft Trump-era politics now looks like exposure and risk. Top Democrats, including Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Nancy Pelosi \u2014\u00a0who was infuriated when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">a distorted video of her</url> went viral \u2014\u00a0have singled out Facebook as a bad actor. Mr. Trump is, at the moment, viewed by Washington\u2019s insider class as likely to lose in November, though Mr. Biden poses less of a threat to Facebook than Senator Warren would have.</p><p>While executives across Facebook insist that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s position on free speech on the platform is a matter of long-term planning and principle, not political expediency, his political team also recognizes that they are badly out of position for a Democratic administration. And in recent days, Facebook has been eager to show its independence from the White House. The company has been unhesitatingly enforcing existing policy against Mr. Trump\u2019s posts, and has been quick to point it out to the media, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">it did last Thursday</url>, when a Trump ad used a symbol associated with Nazi Germany.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has not budged, however, on his core insistence that Mr. Trump should be able to say what he wants on the platform, and most of what he wants in ads \u2014\u00a0including false statements, as long as they aren\u2019t misleading on specific, narrow topics, like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">the census</url>. But he did reportedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=nytmag&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=left_behind_draper\">tell</url> Mr. Trump that he objected, personally, to Mr. Trump\u2019s warning that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d And he and Ms. Chan wrote to scientists funded by their nonprofit organization that they were \u201cdeeply shaken and disgusted by President Trump\u2019s divisive and incendiary rhetoric.\u201d</p><p>Those gestures may have appeased Facebook\u2019s work force, but they\u2019ve gone largely unnoticed in Washington.</p><p>\u201cAll the big companies tacked to the right after Trump won, and Facebook probably moved farther than the others,\u201d said Nu Wexler, a Democrat who worked in policy communications for Facebook in Washington. \u201cBut the politics of tech are changing, and companies should be worried about Democrats as well. The days of just keeping the president happy are over.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Brandon Celi FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000007197324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6064-1CB1-DXY4-X02C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1876\"/><timeReceived>19:56 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Zuckerberg, Mark E</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kaplan, Joel D</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zuckerberg, Mark E</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Politics and Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kaplan, Joel D</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulation and Deregulation of Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political Advertising</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Laws and Competition Issues</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice Department</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Freedom of Speech and Expression</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

One of the big tech items this year was autonomous, or self driving, cars. However, don't go out and buy one as there are still some bugs to work out. With Tesla, Google, Ford Blackberry and others entering what may be an unwanted and overcrowded field, self-driving cars still have a very long way to go. What would be your reaction in Hodgenville if you saw a car headed down the road with no driver? Yes, exactly! It is kind of like the other day, I saw a horse running across a pasture without a rider. Think about it.</p><p>The next big thing was Virtual Reality. In fact, Fortune magazine, among others has heralded 2016 as The Year of Virtual Reality. Virtual Reality is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. Think Google Glass on steroids, or Oculus Gear VR, now owned by Facebook. Sony's PlayStation VR has gotten some great press as has Microsoft's HoloLen's, which I am excited about because of the potential for virtual business applications, such as inventory distribution and retail sales. So you can bet I will be watching VR closely as the year evolves.</p><p> Wearable technology and the Internet of Things, which I have written about here before, were also very hot to the point of now being considered mainstream. Wearables were everywhere, such as watches, wristbands (think track your health), jewelry, and clothing that all connects to the internet. In the Internet of Things category, Amazon's Echo won high awards as technology that works, is improving, and available today. The Echo was my favorite Christmas present and I will be writing more about it soon.</p><p> At times, CES 2016 looked more like an auto show than an electronics show. That's because all the major car manufacturers were there displaying upcoming integrated technology into their cars of the future. Partnerships with Google, Microsoft, Apple and HP and others abound.</p><p> And finally, Drones, Drones, Drones! From paper airplanes to single passenger vehicles, drones were everyone. Government regulations aside, it seems everyone wants a drone for fun and for business. While this may not be the year of the drone \u2013 they are coming!</p><p> In other strategic announcements. Microsoft stood by its deadline to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, which was January 12th. You can still upgrade to Windows 8.1 if you are willing to go ahead and upgrade to Windows 10. By the way, you really have virtually no choice as Microsoft is forcing all desktops to move to Windows 10 this year.</p><p> The good news is that Windows 7.x and Windows 8.x users can upgrade to Windows 10 for free. I have had a number of strange issues occur with Windows 10 upgrades, mostly related to third-party software and some very old hardware not being compatible. Again, test your computer and decide if it is time for you to go for it.</p><p> Besides the death of Windows 8 on January 12th, Microsoft also killed Internet Explorer Browser 8-10 with 11 soon to follow. Instead they are pushing Edge, their new Windows 10 Browser, which works totally different and will be a pain to learn \u2013 but again you don't really have a choice, so dig in.</p><p> There are lots of hyperlinks and more detail information in this issue, so check out the Larue County Herald for our digital version, and to have access to all those hyperlinks.

The question was whether the law can be improved. Section 230 does need work, though there's plenty of room for debate about exactly how to fix it. These are my mostly tentative and entirely personal thoughts on the question the Attorney General has asked.Section 230 gives digital platforms two immunities - one for publishing users' speech and one for censoring users' speech. </p><p>the second is the bigger problem. Immunity for what users say and do online When section 230 was adopted, the impossibility of AOL, say, monitoring its users in a wholly effective way was obvious. It couldn't afford to hire tens of thousands of humans to police what was said in its chatrooms, and the easy digital connection it offered was so magical that no one wanted it to be saddled with such costs. Section 230 was an easy sell.A lot has changed since 1996. Facebook and other have in fact already hired tens of thousands of humans to police what is said on their platforms. Combined with artificial intelligence, content fingerprinting, and more, these monitors work with considerable success to stamp out certain kinds of speech. And although none of these efforts are foolproof, preventing the worst online abuses has become part of what we expect from social media. The sweeping immunity Congress granted in Section 230 is as dated as the Macarena, another hit from 1996 whose appeal seems inexplicable today. Today, jurisdictions as similar to ours as the United Kingdom and the European Union have abandoned such broad grants of immunity, making it clear that they will severely punish any platform that fails to censor its users promptly.That doesn't mean the US should follow the same path. We don't need a special, harsher form of liability for big tech companies. But why are we still giving them a blanket immunity from ordinary tort liability for the acts of third parties? In particular, why should they be immune from liability for utterly predictable criminal use of warrant-proof encryption? I've written on this recently[2] and won't repeat what I said there, except to make one fundamental point.Immunity from tort liability is a subsidy, one we often give to nascent industries that capture the nation's imagination. But once they've grown big, and the harm they can cause has grown as well, that immunity has to be justified anew. In the case of warrant-proof encryption, the justifications are thin. Section 230 allows tech companies to capture all the profits to be made from encrypting their services while exempting them from the costs they are imposing on underfunded police forces and victims of crime.That is not how our tort law usually works. Usually, courts impose liability on the party that is in the best position to minimize the harm a new product can cause. Here, that's the company that designs and markets an encryption system with predictable impact on victims of crime. Many believe that the security value of unbreakable encryption outweighs the cost to crime victims and law enforcement. Maybe so. But why leave the weighing of those costs to the blunt force and posturing of political debate? Why not decentralize and privatize that debate by putting the costs of encryption on the same company that is reaping its benefits? If the benefits outweigh the costs, the company can use its profits to insure itself and the victims of crime against the costs. Or it can seek creative technical solutions that maximize security without protecting criminals - solutions that will never emerge from a political debate. Either way it's a private decision with few externalities, and the company that does the best job will end up with the most net revenue. That's the way tort law usually works, and it's hard to see why we shouldn't take the same tack for encryption.2. Immunity for censoring users Detecting bias.The harder and more urgent Section 230 problem is what to do about Silicon Valley's newfound enthusiasm for censoring users whose views it disapproves of. I confess to being a conservative, whatever that means these days, and I have little doubt that social media content mediation rules are biased against conservative speech. This is hard to prove, of course, in part because social media has a host of ways to disadvantage speakers who are unpopular in the Valley. Their posts can be quarantined, so that only the speaker and a few persistent followers ever see them but none knows of that distribution has been suppressed. Or they can be demonetized, so that Valley-unpopular speakers, even those with large followings, cannot use ad funding to expand their reach. Or facially neutral rules, such as prohibitions on doxing or encouraging harassment, are applied with maximum force only to the unpopular. Combined with the utterly opaque talk-to-the-bot mechanisms for appeal that the Valley has embraced, these tools allow even one or two low-level but highly motivated content moderators to sabotage their target's speech.Artificial intelligence won't solve this problem. It is likely to make it worse. AI is famous for imitating the biases of the decisionmakers it learns from - and for then being conveniently incapable of explaining how it arrived at its own decisions. No conservative should have much faith in a machine that learns its content moderation lessons from current practice in Silicon Valley. Foreign government interference. European governments, unbound by the first amendment, have not been shy about telling Silicon Valley to suppress speech it dislikes, which include true facts about people who claim a right to be forgotten, or charges that a politician belongs to a fascist party, or what it calls hate speech. Indeed, much of the Valley has already surrendered, agreeing to use their terms of service to enforce Europe's sweeping view of hate speech[3]-under which the President's tweets and the Attorney General's speeches could probably be banned today.Europe is not alone in its determination to limit what Americans can say and read. Baidu has argued successfully that it has a first amendment right to return nothing but sunny tourist pictures when Americans searched for \"Tiananmen Square June 1989.\" Jian Zhang v. Baidu.Com Inc., 10 F. Supp. 3d 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Today, any government but ours is free to order a US company to suppress the speech of Americans the government doesn't like.In the long run it is dangerous for American democracy to give highly influential social media firms a blanket immunity when they bow to foreign government pressure and suppress the speech of Americans. We need to armor ourselves against such tactics, not facilitate them. Regulation deserves another look. This isn't the first time we've faced a disruptive new technology that changed the way Americans talked to each other. The rise of broadcasting a hundred years ago was at least at transformational, and as threatening to the political order, as social media today. It played a big role in the success of Hitler and Mussolini, not to mention FDR and Father Coughlin.American politicians worried that radio and television owners could sway popular opinion in unpredictable or irresponsible ways. They responded with a remarkable barrage of new regulation - all designed to ensure that wealthy owners of the disruptive technology did not use it to unduly distort the national dialogue. Broadcasters were required to get government licenses, not once but over and over again. Foreign interests were denied the right to own stations or networks. A \"fairness\" doctrine required that broadcasters present issues in an honest, equitable, and balanced way. Opposing candidates for office had to be given equal air time, and political ads could to be aired at the lowest commercial rate. Certain words (at least seven) could not be said on the radio.This entire edifice of regulation has acquired a disreputable air in elite circles, and some of it has been repealed. Frankly, though, it don't look so bad compared to having a billionaire tech bro (or his underpaid contract workers) decide that carpenters communicating with friends in Sioux Falls are forbidden to \"deadname\" Chelsea Manning or to complain about Congress's failure to subpoena Eric Ciaramella.The sweeping broadcast regulatory regime that reached its peak in the 1950s was designed to prevent a few rich people from using technology to seize control of the national conversation, and it worked. The regulatory elements all pretty much passed constitutional muster, and the worst that can be said about them today is that they made public discourse mushy and bland because broadcasters were cautious about contradicting views held by a substantial part of the American public.Viewed from 2020, that doesn't sound half bad. We might be better off, and less divided, if social media platforms were more cautious today about suppressing views held by a substantial part of the American public.Whether all these rules would survive contemporary first amendment review is hard to know. But government action to protect the speech of the many from the censorship of the privileged deserves, and gets, more leeway from the courts than the free speech absolutists would have you believe. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001).That said, regulation has many risks, not least the risk of abuse. Each political party in our divided country ought to ask what the other party would do if given even more power over what can be said on line. It's a reason to look elsewhere for solutions. Network effects and competitive dominance. Maybe we wouldn't need a lot of regulation to protect minority views if there were more competition in social media - if those who don't like a particular platform's censorship rules could go elsewhere to express their views.In practice, they can't. YouTube dominates video platforms, Facebook dominates social platforms, Amazon dominates online book sales, etc. Thanks to network effects, if you want to spread your views by book, by video, or by social media post, you have to use their platforms and live with their censorship regimes.It's hard to say without investigation whether these platforms have violated antitrust laws in acquiring their dominance or in exercising it. But the effect of that dominance on what Americans can say to each other, and thus on political outcomes, must be part of any antitrust review of their impact. Antitrust enforcement often turns on whether a competitive practice causes consumer harm, and suppression of consumer speech has not usually been seen as such a harm. It should be. Suppression of speech it dislikes may well be one way Silicon Valley takes monopoly profits in something other than cash. If so, there could hardly be a higher priority for antitrust enforcement because such a use of monopoly strikes at the heart of American free speech values.One word of caution: Breaking up dominant platforms in the hope of spurring a competition of ideas won't work if the result is to turn the market over to Chinese companies that already have a similar scale - and even less interest in fostering robust debate online. If we're going to spur competition in social media, we need to make sure we aren't trading Silicon Valley censorship for the Chinese brand. Transparency. Transparency is everyone's favorite first step for addressing the reality and the perception of bias in content moderation. Surely if the rules were clearer, if the bans and demonetizations could be challenged, if inconsistencies could be forced into the light and corrected, we'd all be less angry and suspicious and the companies would behave more fairly. I tend to agree with that sentiment, but we shouldn't kid ourselves. If the rules are made public, if the procedures are made more open - hell, if the platforms just decide to have people answer complaints instead of leaving that to Python scripts\u2014the cost will be enormous.And not just in money. All of the rules, all of the procedures, can be gamed, and more effectively the more transparent they are. Speakers with bad intent will go to the very edge of the rules; they will try to swamp the procedures. And ideologues among the content moderators will still have room to seize on technicalities to nuke unpopular speakers. Transparency may well be a good idea, but its flaws are going to be painful to behold if that's the direction our effort to discipline Section 230 takes.3. What is to be done?So I don't have much certainty to offer. But if I were dealing with the Section 230 speech suppression immunity today, I'd start with something like the following:First, treat speech suppression as an antitrust problem, asking what can be done to create more competition, especially ideological and speech competition, among social media platforms. Maybe breakups would work, although network effects are remarkably resilient. Maybe there are ways antitrust law can be used to regulate monopolistic suppression of speech. In that regard, the most promising measures probably are requiring further transparency and procedural fairness from the speech suppression machinery, perhaps backed up by governmental subpoenas to investigate speech suppression accusations.Second, surely everyone can agree that foreign governments and billionaires shouldn't play a role in deciding what Americans can say to each other. We need to bar foreign ownership of social media platforms that are capable of playing a large role in our political dialogue. We should also use the Foreign Agent Registration Act or something like it to require that speech driven by foreign governments be prominently identified as such. And we should sanction the nations that try to do that.And finally, here's a no-brainer. If nothing else, it's clear that Section 230 is one of the most controversial laws on the books. It is unlikely to go another five years without being substantially amended. So why in God's name are we writing the substance of Section 230 into free trade deals - notably the USMCA? Adding Section 230 to a free trade treaty makes the law a kind of a low-rent constitutional amendment, since if we want to change it in future, organized tech lobbies and our trading partners will claim that we're violating international law. Why would we do this to ourselves? It's surely time for this administration to take Section 230 out of its standard free-trade negotiating package.Note: I have many friends, colleagues, and clients who will disagree with much of what I say here. Don't blame them. These are my views, not those of my clients, my law firm, or anyone else.

The U.S. president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like Trump did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamt in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course.</p><p>Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the offstage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until a final text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on U.S. tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, high-standard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range of drugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general. The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for U.S. firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented this week, but not all. Trudeau's choices will show the extent to which he favours established industries over next generation ones. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The U.S. president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like Trump did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamt back in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course.</p><p>Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the offstage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until afinal text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on U.S. tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, high-standard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range ofdrugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general. The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for U.S. firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented this week, but not all. Trudeau's choices will show the extent to which he favours established industries over next generation ones. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

The U.S. president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like Trump did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamt back in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course.</p><p>Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the offstage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until a final text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on U.S. tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, high-standard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range of drugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general. The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for U.S. firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented this week, but not all. Trudeau's choices will show the extent to which he favours established industries over next generation ones. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

He is therefore forecasting a measurable GDP improvement for 2018, with 2.7 percent growth and most economic sectors producing a healthy showing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He predicts that housing starts and home pricing will tick upward, and the vital price of crude oil will actually decline to around $50-plus per barrel on the world markets. Traditional retail will continue to evolve, along with the associated retail real estate interests, but old economic sectors such as the coal industry will ebb as the dynamics of new industries, such as natural gas, flex their energetic muscles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Of course, a war in Korea could end all bets on forecasting the economy,\" said Faucher.</p><p>The Congressional effort toward changes in the federal taxation system according to Faucher, will also help to provide a bump upward with commerce. However, he warns that the current effort is not genuine tax reform, because it will undoubtedly increase the national debt, thereby producing only a short-term stimulus.</p><p>Faucher also remarked that the Federal Reserve appears to be following a cautious, but genuine pro-growth agenda in the manner of the past decade. The year ahead for legislators will probably witness spirited debate about the financial implications of massive baby boomer retirements, how to pay for promised benefits, and the amount of financial support to deliver in the years ahead.</p><p>Included in this Congressional discussion will be societal questions about what American society will tolerate with the number of uninsured for health care, including within retirement.</p><p>\"No real efforts have been made to cope with rising health care costs,\" said Faucher. \"Washington has conducted absolutely no conversations about this issue because we do not yet have the political will to talk about this very difficult situation.\"</p><p>Faucher added that there are no factual indications off-shored manufacturing jobs will return in large numbers, as promised by President Trump. The true focus within manufacturing has become the use of machines to replace unskilled human workers, thereby making workforce development the key for employment within technology-based manufacturing.</p><p>\"Labor reductions from robotics will become increasingly common in the days ahead, and total manufacturing employment may actually drop,\" said Faucher. \"The big question is how to help those left behind by all of these market changes.\"</p><p>Tax reform bump</p><p>Washington's efforts at tax reform will undoubtedly fuel some growth for Pennsylvania's $531 billion GDP, predicted Gene Barr, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>However, Barr warned that to a large degree anticipatory returns already have been taken out of the reform's final effects, and he questions if the national economy will receive the mass economic bump forecasted by Washington. In addition, the resultant increase in the national debt will inevitably serve as an economic brake, with any positive GDP growth actually dependent upon how each state has made itself competitive for business.</p><p>Barr also reported that the economic agony of the Great Recession is finally fading into the rearview mirror of business.</p><p>\"Overall, our chamber members are commenting that their businesses are doing quite well,\" said Barr. 'They are optimistic despite the apparent inability of our lawmakers to get out of the way.\"</p><p>Concerns for 2018 voiced by chamber members, according to Barr, include the negative effects of President Trump's demeanor, changing American demographics and a frustrating inability to fill skilled jobs. Federal immigration policies should include attention to workforce needs, with the reality that there is no evidence Trump can be successful at bringing back offshored low-skill manufacturing jobs.</p><p>\"Automation use is sure to expand during 2018, and workforce preparation must focus on higher end jobs that require education and specific skills,\" said Barr. \"This is a vital part of the economic development picture.\"</p><p>He warned that a high school diploma is now insufficient preparation for most jobs, although a two-year tech degree or certificate of competency increasingly opens many skilled-employment doors. As all of these scenarios play out during 2018, unknowns that could cause mass disruption are plentiful, such as a war in Korea, tax reform side-effects and terrorist or cyber-attacks.</p><p>\"We're also concerned about the divisiveness around the country,\" said Barr. \"I personally believe divisiveness is more widespread than any time since the Civil War era.\"</p><p>Technological disruptions</p><p>The non-profit trade association CompTIA has reported that tech employment within the United States now exceeds 6.7 million people. Tech firms are producing more than seven percent of the national GDP, and generating 11 percent of the total national payroll within the private sector.</p><p>Within this surging economic engine expectations are strong for increased disruption in large markets such as government, health care and financial services, according to Kris Jones, founder and CEO of LSEO. Old entrenched ways will increasingly be replaced by new technologies such as voice recognition and artificial intelligence as big tech companies continue to enter new industries with more resources than these industries want to address.</p><p>\"Get ready for more and more conversational devices that trigger action, such as email by voice,\" said Jones.</p><p>He further forecasts that 2018 will include an increased integration of digital commerce. The survivors of this disruption must operate brick and mortar plus a digital presence as they cash in on sales technology with efficiency and integration.</p><p>\"Voice technology that allows facial recognition for security will also begin to make digital passwords obsolete,\" said Jones.</p><p>On-demand video services such as Netflix will continue to prosper during 2018, with more original content available to viewers than ever before. This, according to Jones, will be matched to rising usage of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, as business units such as financial services and health care become ripe for inclusion with these digital technologies.</p><p>\"Resistance to these and other forms of digital disruption is ebbing because of recognition that the resultant efficiency and convenience are good for business,\" said an enthusiastic Jones.</p><p>Strategic policies?</p><p>Any economic forecasts about 2018 must include information that examines trends within the nation's bustling health care system. During 2017, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services, domestic health care spending exceeded $3.3 trillion, accounting for 17.9 percent of the nation's GDP.</p><p>Justin Matus, Ph.D., associate professor and director of MBA program for the Sidhu School of Business and Leadership at Wilkes University, also serves on the board of directors for Wilkes-Barre General Hospital. He accused Washington of only being concerned with movement of insurance dollars, while no strategic attempt has been made to actually tackle health care policy and system-wise rising costs.</p><p>Dr. Matus further declared that the percentage of domestic GDP spending for health care is out of control, while all talk about healthy competition within providers is a falsehood. Only pseudo competition exists, because system size rules as limited number of massive health care systems do battle over a limited number of patients.</p><p>Merger, consolidations and vertical integration will therefore continue to be paramount within complex health care business strategies as provider systems strive to do business under one roof. Dr. Matus therefore forecasts that the drive toward increased system size, with decreasing competition, will dominate during 2018.</p><p>According to Dr. Matus, an interesting systemic change may be occurring in Denmark as front-line caregivers unionize. This is being done to counteract the loss of power being experienced by general practitioners, and Dr. Matus believes a similar movement could take root here during 2018.</p><p>\"Value-based medicine is the thrust in America as the big health care systems seek more bang for their buck,\" said Dr. Matus. \"This is decreasing the power of the front-line physicians, but based on what I have seen overseas the care givers are reacting to regain some ofthat control.\"</p><p>Dr. Matus also forecasted that health care will see an increased use of artificial intelligence for diagnosis. In many cases digital technology can interpret tools such as diagnostic scans better than a human, making this change predictable within the nation's care system.</p><p>\"On a negative note, I also believe there no basis for optimism that the general public is going to take wellness seriously,\" said Dr. Matus. \"Only reduced demands for health care will reduce the amount we as a society are spending.\"</p><p>Taxation smiles</p><p>On the Pennsylvania manufacturing front, industry is generating more than $2.1 trillion in total GDP. This scenario is sure to evolve as infrastructure renewal, regulatory rollbacks and tax reform provide fertile ground for manufacturers, according to David Taylor, president and CEO of Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association.</p><p>Washington's tax changes, according to Taylor, have a reasonable chance of bringing home $2 trillion to the United States that has been stranded overseas due to lower corporate tax rates abroad.</p><p>\"I'm quite sure tax reform will not be just a financial iceberg for the wealthy,\" said Taylor. \"Corporations are being put into better investment situations, and this will eventually benefit everyone.\"</p><p>On a specific note, manufacturing's use of robots is sure to increase, according to Taylor. These technologies are proving to be transformational in industries such as logistics, and are expanding daily into the manufacturing sector as technologies such as programmable controllers advance.</p><p>\"Efficiency and productivity, plus safety, are the goals within manufacturing, but the new technologies definitely are causing thousands of lost jobs with new jobs also being created,\" said Taylor. 'This can be hard for people, but history clearly shows ongoing change with employment is normal. Political infighting about this is not good, because we must find new ways to use our workforce skills, intellects and talents.\"</p><p>Demographic changes</p><p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the academic year 2014 to 2015, total revenues at degree-granting postsecondary institutions within the nation totaled $567 billion in current dollars. This unfolded within a labor-intensive economic sector dealing with rising operating costs, such as health care insurance, and demographics challenges including a 10-percent drop in the number of 18-year-old potential students.</p><p>\"We knew this big demographic challenge was coming,\" said Thomas Botzman, Ph.D., president of Misericordia University. \"An 18-year-old can only attend one school at a time.\"</p><p>To counteract this and other difficult economic challenges facing the nation's colleges, schools must leam to better market themselves, according to Dr. Botzman.</p><p>The national tax reform is also creating an environment that may be damaging to collegiate budgets and associated enrollments, despite the factual evidence that most four-year degrees have not lost their value.</p><p>\"Four-year graduates are now earning $500,000 to $1 million dollars more over a lifetime as opposed to no college,\" said Dr. Botzman. \"That's a pretty good investment.\"</p><p>He added that enhanced abilities to read and think critically will continue to be vital as the American economy evolves in the 21 st Century.

It was a year later that Apple shipped the first iPhone. #mindfck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the QLD Cane Toads and the NSW Cockroaches were smashing into each other with gusto and fans of both teams roared encouragement for 'their' team, I was in Melbourne, where nobody cares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the Uber Melbourne party a lot of Uber's customers wanted to talk about authorities in Australia and elsewhere issuing fines to UberX drivers, on the grounds they're unlicensed by the government bodies that license taxi drivers in those locales.</p><p>Like footy supporters passionately defending 'their' team, many of the Uber customers at the party were vocal about how unfair these bureaucrats were being. It wasn't just a government department battling a corporation, it was 'us' (Uber-plus-customers) versus 'them' (stoopid taxi licensing bureaucrats and evil, doomed taxi industry magnates). They sounded less like customers and more like Uber supporters, like this was a football match between Uber and the government regulator.</p><p>Interesting. And potentially valuable.</p><p>How do you create the conditions necessary to convert dispassionate, price-comparing, review-reading customers to passionate supporters? Supporters who'll defend your brand against all threats, real and perceived? What a powerful force for customer growth and retention. My guess is the same narratives that define a sporting allegiance also work for startup brands.</p><h>Be different, from a long way off</h><p>It helps if you're obviously externally different to your competitors, so much so that your customers can be separated from your competitor's customers at a distance.</p><p>If your customers can identify those not-like-them from a distance, they (like sports team supporters) can tell themselves apart from the 'enemy' in time to ensure they can maintain some separation. If you get too close to the enemy, you begin to realise how much you actually have in common, so prejudices are more easily maintained if you're keeping your distance.</p><p>If you're marketing one brand of smartphone against another, nobody can tell whether you're an Android fan or an iOS fan until you pull your smartphone out of your pocket. That's an issue.</p><p>Unless, of course, you're an Apple supporter wearing those easily-identifiable white Apple earbuds that have remained essentially the same through many generations of both earbud and in-ear product lines. The latest earbuds shipping with an iPhone 5s are easily identifiable as the progeny of the first earbuds that shipped with the very first iPod. Even when Apple introduced a colour range for iPods and then iPhones, the earbuds remained available only in one colour. Accidental? I think not.</p><p>Uber customers are potentially very different. When everyone else at the bar is glancing around wondering how hard it's going to be to hail a cab, and where they should start walking to, the Uber customer is still relaxed and casual at the bar\u200a-\u200athe iPhone app and push notification will let them know when the Uber car is approaching and they can waft out the door and straight in the town car.</p><p>Same at the destination\u200a-\u200aa taxi pulls over in a no-standing zone for what seems customer is futzing around with cash or credit card transactions. An Uber customer wafts out the door of their town car apparently without paying at all, safe in the knowledge the Uber platform will bill them a fair price when it notices customer and car have parted ways.</p><h>Uniform your supporters</h><p>Fierce though their allegiances are (and even though Apple includes an Apple sticker with every product it sells) you don't see a lot of branding on customers or their cars in the technology industry.</p><p>You can be pretty certain most people wearing a tech brand either work for the company behind the brand or have just attended an event where the branded gear was handed out.</p><p>I think that's partly because in tech the product itself is often all the branding you need\u200a-\u200aany noob can tell the difference between an Apple MacBook and a Dell CrapBook.</p><p>But I think it's also because in tech we're pretty sure we'd be helping a massively profitable corporation become more massively profitable by wearing its branded tees. Football teams are amongst the most successful corporations in the world though, so why don't fans of Manchester United feel like they're being exploited for corporate profit?</p><p>I think it's because the central narrative of, say, Google is \"two smart nerdy guys get lucky with their first business out of school and are billionaires in a few years\" whereas the central narrative of all successful sporting teams is, \"This is a constant battle, we're on a razor's edge. We train ourselves to exhaustion, we devote our lives to the game, we give everything we have to every game we play, and if we don't we will be defeated.\"</p><p>That observation is supported by the higher frequency of supporter uniforms amongst underdog, challenger tech brands. The little team at Aussie startup Bugcrowd (disclosure: I'm an investor) sends out a few tees to their favourite customers and not only do people wear them, but they usually post pics to their social media or blog. Bugcrowd customers wear their Bugcrowd tees to big tech security conventions because they're in the minority; they're the outsiders; they're the marginalised, non-corporate misfits in tech security. They want to find each other and grow stronger through being together - like sports team supporters at an away game.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Story continues on page 2. Please click below.</emphasis></p><p>Brand without logos</p><p>A new Manchester United supporter is joining a worldwide community of millions with a heritage going back generations. They know what it means to be a supporter and who their community expects them to be. They'll wear the team's brand with confidence because the last thing a football team ever does is dramatically change what it stands for and who it represents. If a team moves to a new city, takes on a foreign owner, or moves upmarket, it's a really, really big issue and generally a last resort.</p><p>In tech, even where we have a decade of cultural history to draw upon, it's usually included several dramatic shifts in direction and character. More tech companies get acquired or fail in five years than IPO. Sometimes it's a last resort, but more often it's the nature of the industry to change rapidly to seek new opportunities and technologies.</p><p>That constant change means a supporter isn't so certain exactly which community they're joining. They're not so ready to wear your brand.</p><p>But they might be prepared to wear a t-shirt like Bugcrowd's, which mainly features a tech security in-joke (\"My other computer is your computer\"). If you can brand the merchandise with something that relates to the community they're part of, rather than the brand of your tech company, you're going to see better results.</p><p>They might be prepared to wear a tee or hoodie in a brand colour if you feel you can own that brand colour over time, and they may be prepared to wear the brand if it's small and subtle. They might be interested in something truly unique\u200a-\u200anot just branded but completely new-like a new take on scarves, or hats, or jackets.</p><h>It's not a numbers game</h><p>On the playing field of a sporting stadium, I'm sure it feels like the team with the most fans has an advantage. But remember, this is not about the team, it's about the supporters. When trying to turn your customers into fanatic supporters, it's not a numbers game, it's an allegiance game. In the stadium stands, it's the supporters of the underdog team who are most likely to shout louder, try harder, and band together in unity.</p><p>So when you're planning your supporter merchandise, don't be an economist\u200a-\u200adon't decide to produce the maximum amount of merchandise at the lowest cost. Don't keep it all in a warehouse, only bring it to trade shows, and then employ tradeshow trash to hand it out to every stranger to happens to wander by.</p><h>Tradeshow trash</h><p>Tradeshow trash don't represent your customer community. Lowest-cost scratchy Chinese cotton tees don't make any customer feel like you care about their support. And seeing them being handed out to people who are clearly not supporters is the last straw in supporter alienation.</p><p>Instead, produce a limited quantity of high-quality merchandise. Make customers earn the right to wear it\u200a-\u200anot by tweeting about how awesome your products are but by really relating to your community\u200a-\u200ahelping contribute to FAQs, helping other customers with a question, volunteering to host a customer meetup. Make other customers aspire to get one too.</p><p>Every team's supporter community has a small set of hard-core, diehard fans at its very centre, and when you begin creating a supporter base for your tech startup brand, the first people to recruit are a small group of time-rich, no-friend, slightly mad customers looking for a chance to be the hard-core, diehard fans at the centre of a new team.</p><p>Uber Melbourne, by the way, didn't give any of us tees at the party. Maybe they knew we hadn't earned it and hopefully it knows we're way too cool to wear it ... yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alan Jones is an ex-Yahoo product guy,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/startmate\">@startmate</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/pollenizer\">@pollenizer</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">investor/mentor, and co-founder of</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/thenewagencyAU\">@thenewagencyAU</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This story first appeared on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.StartupSmart.com.au\">StartupSmart</url>.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CH1-K3H1-JD6R-T01H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><timeReceived>1:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 23, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

In category after category of this year's Financial Planning Tech Survey, we found software providers making the shift, and advisors responding. In CRM software, cloud-based providers are gaining share at the expense of desktop-based products; in portfolio management, advisors are moving to a hosted solution where a cloud version is unavailable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advisors report that mobile devices like smartphones rank in the top three among technology shifts that have benefited their firms most. Even the growing use of online file-sharing services helps unlock the handcuffs chaining advisors to their desks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following pages contain more details on the tools advisors are using to boost efficiency and client satisfaction. Other changes are afoot as well, of course. This year's study pointed to marketplace changes in CRM, rebalancing and portfolio technology. Advisor satisfaction with broker-dealer technology also seems to be on the mend.</p><p>A few notes on methodology: The survey was conducted in October. To prevent any ballot-box stuffing, Financial Planning sent out thousands of individual-use links to advisors; we got more than 1,100 responses, several times the number need to ensure statistical accuracy, according to polling experts.</p><p>We dissected the results by business model to get a feel for the similarities and differences in the way independent RIAs differ in their approach from hybrid advisors and those linked to independent broker- dealers. We also added a new level of analysis this year, exploring how firms of varying sizes (as measured by AUM) differ in their technology decisions.</p><p>WHO'S SPENDING?</p><p>One thing that we wanted to gauge at the outset was whether advisors were as willing to spend on technology as they were last year. Apparently, they are: Those who expect their technology budgets to grow in 2014 is flat (35% versus 36% last year), as is the relatively small slice who expect their budgets to shrink.</p><p>The results suggest that advisors understand that technology is an investment in their business as opposed to an expense, and that it will pay dividends. What we did not know, but often assumed, is that behaviors would differ across firm size.</p><p>We can now confirm this: Noticeably fewer (27.5%) of the smallest firms, with less than $10 million in AUM, are likely to increase tech spending in 2014. One possible reason is that capital may be tight at smaller firms; the other is that technology enhancements may not provide as much operational leverage.</p><p>Indeed, the firms most likely (41.5%) to increase tech spending in 2014 are those managing between $50 million and $99.9 million in assets. That's unsurprising: Firms of this size have the scale to truly benefit from technology investments, and if they are growing, may not have invested as deeply when they were smaller. This bodes well for broker-dealers, custodians and vendors who serve this segment, which accounted for about 12% of our respondents.</p><p>CRM CHANGES AFOOT</p><p>One place the cloud shift is evident is in the CRM category, where we see a slow but clear trend toward more modern cloud-based tools and away from desktop-server-based systems. Redtail made some incremental gains in share this year, as did Salesforce and Tamarac Advisor CRM, to cite a few examples. Meanwhile, older technologies slipped: ACT! dropped to a 7% share from 9% last year and ACT4Advisors dropped to 1.2% from 2%, with weak showings for both among independent RIAs. Goldmine fell, as well.</p><p>Junxure, a former darling among sophisticated independent RIAs, showed some slippage, as did ProTracker. Both are about to release totally new cloud versions of their software, and it will be interesting to see the impact of these releases. We think both will attract some serious attention.</p><p>Redtail, the overall leader among real CRM systems, did particularly well with hybrids, although it also had strong usage among independent broker-dealer reps and RIAs. And Micro- soft Outlook still gets too many votes in our survey, but its share is way down from last year (22.2% versus 35%), suggesting that advisors are finally beginning to realize that Outlook is no substitute for a real CRM system. (Although almost a third of the smallest firms are still using Outlook.)</p><p>We've long theorized that Redtail is most popular at the low end of the AUM scale and least popular at the high end. Redtail is inexpensive, which appeals to smaller firms with smaller tech budgets, and it is not as robust as some of the more expensive systems. But Redtail has been getting a steady stream of incremental upgrades, making it a more powerful product than it was a few short years ago.</p><p>Probably for that reason, we found we were only partly right. Redtail did score poorly among firms with more than $500 million in AUM, but the group with the next lowest usage was firms with less than $10 million in AUM. The highest Redtail usage was in the $25 million to $49.9 million group, and it fared almost as well among firms with $100 million to $499.9 million. We only saw a substantial shrinkage in market share among the biggest firms.</p><p>When we sliced the CRM market share based on compensation models, we found that fee-only advisors were more likely to use Junxure, Salentica and Tamarac Advisor CRM, while ACT!, Advisors Assistant and Ebix scored substantially better with hybrid advisors. Redtail did a bit better with the fee and commission crowd, but exhibited good strength across both roles, as did Salesforce.</p><p>REBALANCING SOFTWARE</p><p>Rebalancing software has become a growth segment of the market. Although 60.6% of advisors are not using any rebalancing software at all, that number is markedly lower than last year's 69%. And the bigger the firm, the more likely it is to use rebalancing software: Less than half of firms with more than $500 million in AUM have not purchased rebalancing software, compared with 78.1% of the smallest firms.</p><p>No surprise there: The better programs, which feature both tax and location sensitivity, tend to be pricey, and advisors who are only monitoring a limited number of accounts might believe (mistakenly, in our view) that they don't need this type of software.</p><p>Last year, we did not include Morningstar Office in the rebalancing category; this year, we did - and it debuts in the top spot. Morningstar only rebalances at the account level, not at the client or household level, and it is not tax aware, so it is no competition for the more sophisticated products, but it is apparently sufficient for many advisors, across all AUM levels. One reason may be that the tool is included as part of the Morningstar Office package.</p><p>Among the more robust products, Tamarac leads with a 3.8% share, and with almost all its users above the $100 million AUM cutoff. The same can be said for iRebal.</p><p>We also asked about iRebal Cloud, because we expected it to be available to all TD Ameritrade advisors by the time of the survey, but the general release has been delayed, so the user base was insignificant. We expect it to be very popular with advisors that custody exclusively with TD Ameritrade.</p><p>TABLETS &amp; SMARTPHONES</p><p>It should come as no surprise that, as the cloud shift continues and advisors are less tied to their desks, mobile adoption grew, as well. This year, 58.8% of advisors told us they use a tablet for business, up from about 50% last year. Of those, 77.5% use an iPad and 18.6% use an Android tablet. The surprise here was the Windows tablet showing; 11.5% of the tablet users say they use one.</p><p>It is also interesting to note the usage variations by type of advisor. For example, 22% of CPA advisors who own a tablet for work use a Windows tablet, as do 15.4% of insurance advisors. And insurance agents are just as likely to own an Android tablet as they are an iPad.</p><p>Smartphone adoption is still growing, too, with 87% of advisors now saying they use a smartphone for work; that's up from 80% last year. The iPhone is the dominant brand, with a 62.3% share, followed by Android at 35.9% and BlackBerry still in the mix at 8.8% - with its users dominated by bank advisors and broker-dealer employees. It is worth noting that while Windows tablets surprised us on the upside, Windows phones did not, showing a mere 2.1% share.</p><p>SOCIAL MEDIA</p><p>Speaking broadly, social media adoption appears to have plateaued. The numbers from this year for the most used outlets (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube) are remarkably similar to last year's.</p><p>When you break those numbers down by revenue, however, some interesting patterns emerge. The smallest firms (those with less than $10 million in AUM) made greater use of every single social media platform we asked about - by a significant margin in some cases. For example, the smallest firms were almost twice as likely as the average firm to use Google+, and about 40% more likely than average to use Facebook.</p><p>There could be multiple explanations: Many of these firms are new, so in some cases they may be run by younger, more tech-savvy advisors. And social media is an inexpensive way for startups to build brand awareness.</p><p>Or course, there's another plausible explanation (although we hope this is not the case): inexperience may mean they are less aware of the regulations and requirements with regard to social media usage.</p><p>There were other marked differences in social media use. Independent RIAs are the leaders here - significantly more likely to use Twitter, for instance, and somewhat more likely to use Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube. This is probably because they have more control over their own compliance policies, and because there are numerous low-cost compliance/archiving technologies available to them.</p><p>FINANCIAL PLANNING MISS?</p><p>One area where software use showed a disappointing decline was in financial planning tools, where 30.6% of respondents said they are not using financial planning software - up from 26% last year. That's a shame, we think, because many financial planning software packages are more user-friendly, making it easier and faster than ever to provide meaningful results to a body of clients who badly need it.</p><p>It's worth noting that a whopping 57.5% of commission-based advisors do not use financial planning software.</p><p>MoneyGuidePro continues its dominance this year with a 22% market share, with consistently high usage across firms of all sizes. The No. 2 product, eMoney, was also consistent across the AUM spectrum, with the exception of the smallest segment, where firms might consider eMoney too pricey.</p><p>Zywave's NaviPro Suite does well at firms with more than $50 million in AUM, but is strongest above the $500 million mark - no doubt because of its detailed cash flow planning capability. And we are keeping an eye on SunGard, which also seems to do better with higher-asset firms. After many years of stagnation, the firm is introducing new products again and refining existing ones.</p><p>PORTFOLIO COMPETITION</p><p>Portfolio management, with 23 products listed this year, is one of the most competitive software categories. A primary reason for this is money: Price tags in this category tend to be high, so software developers find it an attractive market. We also think that, with few exceptions, the reporting capabilities of vendors in this space lag advisor expectations - as well as those of their clients - by a significant margin. For these reasons, we expect new products to continue to launch in this space.</p><p>As was the case last year, Morningstar and Albridge dominated the rankings, although the gap has closed a bit this year. Albridge, which has always had a strong focus on the institutional side of the business, gets the majority of its business from advisors who charge a combination of fees and commissions, with most of the remainder coming from commission-only advisors. But Morningstar Office users were fairly evenly split among the compensation models.</p><p>Dominant products for fee-only advisors - by a wide margin - were Schwab's PortfolioCenter and Advent Axys. Addepar, which has generated a lot of industry buzz, had only a 0.1% share in its survey debut.</p><p>Albridge's former CEO told us that he struggled to find a cost-effective service model for independent RIAs. But change may be coming. Pershing veteran Marc Butler is now a managing director at Albridge, and we expect the company to release a totally new version of its portfolio software in the first half of 2014.</p><p>Because Schwab is the largest custodian to independent RIAs, it makes sense that PortfolioCenter shows strength in that sector. Over the last several years, however, the product seems to be slipping in the rankings, which we attribute to advisors' dissatisfaction with the application's reporting capabilities. Schwab is aware of the complaints; we expect it to launch a new application to address the issue, but probably not till sometime in 2015.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY SATISFACTION</p><p>Compared with the custodians for independent advisors, broker-dealers have lagged for years in technology satisfaction. But the B-Ds' technology fortunes appear to be rising, suggesting that they've discovered what the RIA custodians figured out a few years ago: Good technology increases efficiency and client satisfaction.</p><p>No B-D has a higher percentage of very satisfied advisors than Raymond James, where a significant investment in technology over the last several years is paying off. The percentage of respondents who are very satisfied with Raymond James technology doubled this year to 42.7%.</p><p>NFP's gains are impressive, as well, with the B-D more than doubling the percentage of very satisfied advisors to 39% from 16.9%. Other B-Ds with a high percentage of very satisfied advisors include Securities America (38.5%) and Cambridge Investment Research (37.8%).</p><p>Among the custodians, TD Ameritrade leads the pack, with 47.6% of their advisors saying they're very satisfied with the technology. Much of this is due to the very popular VEO Open Access integration initiative, but TD's decision to release a free, cloud-based version of iRebal to advisors next year no doubt helped perceptions, as well.</p><p>Schwab is within striking distance, with 44.0% of very satisfied advisors. Fidelity is third at 36.2%.</p><p>Among the custodians with a reputation for welcoming small advisors, TradePMR scored the best. We believe the company's new Fusion platform will propel it to even better scores next year, but this year's transition from the old platform may have held back scores. Shareholders Service Group came in a strong second.</p><p>TECH HYPE</p><p>One new area we studied this year was the link between hype and awareness of some new technology products. Because we've often been surprised by the disproportionate attention some unproven new technologies have received, we wanted to find out whether a few heavily covered new products had actually gained high brand awareness - or use.</p><p>We selected three new products: Blueleaf, InStream and Market 76. We expected to find that a significant proportion of readers were at least familiar with the brands.</p><p>That turned out not to be the case: Fewer than 10% of respondents had heard of Market 76, fewer than 15% had heard of InStream and fewer than 20% of readers knew Blueleaf. Usage ranked from 0.2% for Market 76 to a high of 0.8% for InStream.</p><p>Since all three providers started out as either free or low-cost solutions, we thought that smaller advisors, with their smaller tech budgets, might have greater familiarity with these firms.</p><p>We were wrong. Across all three products, advisors with less than $25 million in AUM were less likely than the average reader to have heard of these firms.</p><p>OPERATING SYSTEMS</p><p>Another area of change is operating systems. Last year, we commented on the high number of Windows XP machines that were still in use. That operating system is more than a decade old, and Microsoft will stop supporting Windows XP in April.</p><p>Thankfully, advisors are starting to heed the call to upgrade. Just 22.3% of respondents said they have an XP machine, versus 37% last year. We optimistically (perhaps we hould say foolishly) hope that number drops to zero by April.</p><p>We also expect Windows 8 to continue to climb in market share. While Windows 7 usage has remained steady, 21.7% of respondents now have at least one Windows 8 machine, up from none last year.</p><p>ONGOING CONCERNS</p><p>Although the overall technology picture is positive, there are some issues that continue to worry us.</p><p>Advisor satisfaction with integration remains low. Only 14.9% of advisors are very satisfied with integration, with 26% either somewhat or very dissatisfied.</p><p>Another worry: 43% of advisors say they evaluate technology based on cost alone, compared with only 9.6% that do a formal ROI analysis. That suggests that advisors may be making poor decisions.</p><p>That said, when we asked which technology had the greatest impact on your firm over the past year, advisors cited CRM tools, financial planning software and smartphones - all of which sounds good to us, as advisors work to improve both efficiency and client relationships.</p><p>It's also worth noting that there are a few things that don't show up in this year's survey, largely because of timing. Some promising new firms aren't mentioned because they have not built a meaningful market share.</p><p>Among the new cloud-based CRM products, Junxure Cloud's delayed general release made it a very minor presence; we expect to see much better numbers next year. We also left ProTracker Cloud off the survey because it was not yet available, but it will be by the time you read this; we'll be reporting next year on how it performs.</p><p>We're also curious about attitudes toward Windows 8. More than 22% of respondents said they were using the operating system, with only 14% planning to switch this year - but the survey closed the day before Windows 8.1 was released. We wonder if the upgrade, which returns the Start button and allows users to choose a more familiar Windows look and feel, will persuade more advisors to switch.</p><p>Although technology advances for financial advisors are often slower and more painful than some would like, the overall trends are positive.</p><p>Generally speaking, advisors are moving to the cloud and leveraging mobile more than they did a year or two ago. Broker-dealers and custodians are investing heavily in new technologies and being rewarded with higher satisfaction ratings, a trend we expect to continue into 2014. Third-party vendors are investing in technology, too, and we expect a number of new and interesting firms to come to market next year.</p><p>Challenges remain, but the industry is making progress.</p><p>Joel Bruckenstein, a Financial Planning columnist in Miramar, Fla., is co-creator of the Technology Tools for Today conference series and technology guides for advisors, including Technology Tools for Today's High-Margin Practice.

WE LOOK AHEAD.</p><p>The survey data tells us what's been going on this past year, but it doesn't tell you what's going to happen next year. Here are a few modest technology predictions for 2014.</p><p>1. Continued cloud migration: A no-brainer. While many advisors continue to express reservations about cloud-based technologies, we believe the shift is inevitable. For firms with less than $1 billion in AUM, the business case is compelling: They can outsource hardware, software, maintenance, backups and - to a large extent - disaster recovery. (The case is less clear-cut for larger firms, which can justify a full-time in-house IT department, but there are still advantages.) Meanwhile, most new advisor software is cloud-based, offering advisors an ever-expanding selection of applications.</p><p>2. Better, deeper integrations: There was a time when a vendor could claim that integration meant a pair of data moves - an export to Excel, and then an import from Excel to the application - and many advisors would accept it. Those days are gone. Advisors now expect true, seamless two-way data transmission between applications. Progress is uneven and there is still a real challenge moving some types of data due to a lack of data standards. Still, we expect further gains in the coming year as more products shift to cloud-based technology, which simplifies connections between different products.</p><p>3. Heavy investments from custodians and IBDs: While the details differ by firm, just about every firm we talk to is spending heavily on advisor technology. LPL, the largest player in the independent B-D space, devoted an unprecedented amount of time to technology at its annual conference this year. It is rolling out new technologies that are significantly better than previous generations, and doing so much more rapidly than in the past. Virtually the same can be said for its major competitors. All of the major RIA custodians are set to enhance their technology offerings, as well. Improvements include deeper integration with third-party providers, improved trading platforms and more powerful and user-friendly mobile apps for both advisors and their end clients.</p><p>4. Security concerns persist: The financial services industry will continue to be attacked by shady characters. It is too big a target to ignore. Years ago, boutique RIA firms might fly under the radar of thieves, but today's search engines and databases make it easy for malicious individuals to identify likely targets in a geographic area. It's also worth noting that many of the security threats now facing firms are behavioral as well as technological: An employee may pick up a malicious USB drive in the parking lot, plug it into an office computer and unleash a virus; or an advisor might click on a link from an email that appears to be from a client. Another common problem involves wire fraud: These scams usually begin when a client's email account gets hijacked by a hacker, who then asks an advisor to complete a wire transfer to a third party.</p><p>5. Data power: There is a great deal of useful data on the servers of advisory firms, custodians and clearing firms, but historically, that data has not been available to advisors in a usable format. That will change in 2014. Pershing and Fidelity have both created new interfaces to make analytics available to advisors in an easy-to-digest format. Envestnet/Tamarac has made similar capabilities available to users, and a number of CRM firms - including Junxure, Redtail and various versions of Salesforce - either already or will soon contain analytics dashboards. This type of information will help advisors run their businesses more efficiently and improve the experience they provide to the end client. Which brings us to ...</p><p>6. Better client experience: Competition from online consumer platforms like Mint and Personal Capital means advisors cannot be complacent about the technology they use to interact with their clients. Consumers want clear, concise, interactive digital reporting; advisor websites must be engaging, easy to navigate and mobile compatible. Fortunately, B-Ds, custodians and vendors will be delivering more tools to help advisors provide a better client experience. Many planning firms will also improve their web presence and create branded mobile apps for their clients. -Joel Bruckenstein</p><p>THINK LIKE A STARTUP</p><p>My firm is four years old and manages $675 million in assets. Yet even now, we still deliberately try to think like a startup - and we think this is key to our firm's success.</p><p>I was talking to a peer at an industry event recently and told her we were making a major software switch for both our portfolio reporting and CRM solution.</p><p>She shook her head. Though she seemed envious of the integration of our new platform, she also said her firm, which is much older, could never make such a switch. \"We have too much history with our systems,\" she said, \"and converting would be near impossible.\"</p><p>Her words stayed with me. I began to wonder: What would happen if the people at Glassman Wealth Services stopped thinking like a startup? What would happen if all the things we love about working here simply eroded over time - because we got too big or too \"mature,\" or had too much history to make changes?</p><p>That was a scary thought. But it also reminded me that, regardless of how big we get, we can't lose the entrepreneurial mind-set that got us where we are.</p><p>Fortunately, there are things that every small business owner - yes, even planners - can do to keep the entrepreneurial fires burning.</p><p>The best way to approach this is to liken these decisions to a home renovation.</p><p>Some decisions are as easy as redecorating or painting - like changing your marketing campaign to include a newsletter, or adding a blog to your website. At the other end of spectrum are the boundaries of the lot - the deal-breakers that would cause one to sell the home and move. For us, this boundary includes our fee-only fiduciary status and our culture.</p><p>Then there are those decisions that are like load-bearing walls. These are essential to the structure of the home, but what if that structure just isn't working anymore? They are messy and costly to move, but the work is doable.</p><p>In our firm, we are not afraid of shifting a few load-bearing walls. We consider the costs and understand that the mess will cause discomfort, but that's not what we focus on.</p><p>Instead, we ask ourselves: Will the cost and mess improve the client experience? Will the change make us more competitive?</p><p>We saw our CRM and portfolio management system as load-bearing walls - and decided that the expense and the six-month effort would both improve our operations significantly and give our clients many benefits that our previous system couldn't provide.</p><p>It's important to ask yourself: What decisions do you consider to be load bearing? Are they legitimately that difficult?</p><p>Inertia, bureaucracy or the acceptance of the status quo can prevent your firm from growing in efficient and profitable ways - and can prove fatal to your business.</p><p>My peer made the mistake of thinking that the reason we were able to change our software system was because we were relatively new. But the truth is that we were able to make that change because we nurture our nimble entrepreneurial mind-set and encourage the type of startup thinking that allows us to embrace change and opportunity. And that's something we'll strive to do no matter how large we get.</p><p>Barry Glassman, CFP, is founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services, an investment and wealth management firm in McLean, Va.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-5756015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B14-8X81-F06X-W0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

A piece of sports equipment made from sponge metal? A sporting goods store without a cashier? A 14-year-old millionaire athlete?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although all of the above may sound like the delirious ramblings of tired editors, these things have already--or will soon--blink into existence. In this special feature, SGB explores the key developments and trends that are destined to drive the sporting goods industry forward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still skeptical? The moisturizing fabric is Skintex and it's made by Cognis. The cashierless technology is called RFID (radio frequency identification). The 14-year-old athlete is Freddy Adu, a soccer player who signed a multi-million-dollar pro contract with MLS. Okay, sponge metal hasn't hit the sports equipment market yet. But it is currently being used in the aerospace industry, so it's only a matter of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Remember, the future is all about possibility.</p><p>**********</p><p>T3K Just Warming Up</p><p>NFL Star Tackling Sudden Success in the Performance Apparel Category</p><p>Making a splash in the performance apparel business was not one of the challenges Simeon Rice anticipated when he began his NFL career in 1996. Yet here Rice is, the driving force behind T3K, one of the breakthrough brands of 2003.</p><p>* BIRTH OF A BRAND The idea for T3K (short for THERMAL 3000) came to Rice at the end of the 1999 season, when his Arizona Cardinals were scheduled to play the Green Bay Packers on the frozen turf of Lambeau Field. Unhappy with the insulating garments supplied by the club--and two sacks shy of setting a franchise record--the cat-quick pass rush specialist pieced together a crude neoprene body suit before the game. Rice stayed warm, got his two sacks and took the first steps toward building a business that, four years later, has the trade truly excited.</p><p>* PRODUCT EVOLUTION Rice continued to tinker with the concept of a clothing line engineered to keep athletes warm when they are out in the cold. From a bulky, handmade prototype, he honed his original idea into a sleek, insulating undergarment that he and several of his fellow Tampa Bay Buccaneers wore during a cold-weather showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles in last year's NFC Championship Game. Rice--who went on to earn a Super Bowl ring--believes his bodywear played a key role in the Bucs' 27-10 victory.</p><p>* BUILDING THE LINE Rice began assembling a team to manufacture, market and sell T3K shortly after the Super Bowl. He partnered with Style Up America, a Los Angeles-based apparel manufacturer that could work with advanced performance materials and could assemble the garments with indestructible flatlock stitching. The line includes light-yet-durable tops, bottoms and headgear.</p><p>* FEATURES &amp; BENEFITS \"There were three key issues we had to deal with before launching the brand,\" says Rice, who demanded that T3K move with the body, while keeping athletes warm and dry. \"We needed seams that would stand up to the kind of forces generated in pro football or pro hockey. We also had to build moisture-moving and temperature-regulating properties into the line to ensure peak performance for the athletes who wear it. The durability issue was solved through the flatlock stitching process, which creates a seam that is virtually indestructible. The comfort issues were addressed through high-tech linings bonded to T3K's insulating outer layer.\"</p><p>* INDUSTRY BUZZ The fact that an NFL superstar was launching a line of insulating performance undergarments created much excitement in the apparel industry. When T3K began shipping in the fall, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The line is simply styled, well priced, and--most important--performs as advertised.</p><p>* T3K IN 2004 In 2004, the company will add a new line using a dual-layer radial knit technical fabric that offers moisture management that is superior to most products currently on the market. The new material is being used in T3K's bodywear, as well as several new styles, including a traditional golf shirt.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>Contact info: website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.t3kwear.com\">www.t3kwear.com</url> ; telephone: (866) 53K-Wear</p><p>Four Questions for Simeon Rice</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>Q: How does T3K fit into the big picture for Simeon Rice?</p><p>A: I am the roots and my business ventures are the branches. As for T3K, I will be involved in the development and promotion of the brand the same way I was involved in its conception, design and engineering: 100 percent, all-out, all the way.</p><p>Q: Is your goal to grow T3K as a non-football-identified brand?</p><p>A: That's correct. Ultimately, people will buy T3K not because \"football star Simeon Rice\" says it works, but because it works. Period. We're already seeing that in our initial orders--a very small percentage is being generated by football accounts.</p><p>Q: How would you characterize the manufacturing, sales and marketing team you've built around this brand?</p><p>A: Experienced, creative, intelligent, honest--people who are focused on the same goal, who know how to develop markets and service accounts, people who pay attention to the details.</p><p>Q: What is the most valuable piece of advice you have received in your business career?</p><p>A: Actually, it was a piece of \"life\" advice from my father. He said, \"Simeon, don't wait for life to dictate what it wants from you, you dictate what you want from life.\" It has helped me maintain control in a crazy business, set high standards for myself and others, and freed me to explore places--like the performance apparel business--that I never expected to go.</p><p>T3K SCORING WITH OUTDOOR RETAILERS</p><p>Identifying new markets is priority one in the performance apparel business, especially if your company is just getting in the game. That has been the focus of the T3K sales and marketing staff from the very beginning, when owner and NFL star Simeon Rice made it crystal clear that this was not to be a \"football-only\" brand. According to National Sales Manager Paul Andre, fulfilling Rice's vision has not exactly been a problem. \"New markets are finding T3K,\" he says. \"When word spread on how well this product performed, we began seeing orders from accounts we never expected. Mountain climbers have picked up on T3K, as have the hunters and fishing enthusiasts.\"</p><p>According to Andre, T3K has also proved an ideal fit for the equestrian market, where there is a demand for lightweight, heat-conserving garments that also allow for full range of motion. For similar reasons, the outdoor business--particularly hunting and fishing--have been drawn to the product. Andre adds that T3K's sales efforts are also expanding to \"non-sports\" applications.</p><p>HOCKEY JOCK CHECKS IN WITH THE PROS</p><p>Within the traditional sports business, T3K's strongest market may be hockey. The company will debut a line of hockey jocks in 2004, with Tampa Bay Lightning All-Star Vincent Lecavalier serving as its endorsing athlete. Claude Gagnon, who is helping to spearhead T3K's hockey business, expects the line to grow rapidly in popularity.</p><p>\"Many pros are already wearing the T3K hockey jock,\" he reports. \"Orders were placed back in the fall by several NHL teams. They love it.\"</p><p>\"As new markets continue to emerge for T3K,\" says Rice, \"we are prepared to design products--as we did for hockey--that meet the unique demands of each.\"</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>INTO THE MATRIX</p><p>Hockey sticks, tennis racquets, golf clubs, bikes, skis and sneakers are certainly indispensable pieces of sports equipment. But so, too, are test tubes, beakers, wind tunnels, machine shops and compression machines. After all, a product's performance characteristics depend on the materials from which it is made, and without lab testing and scientific innovation, sporting goods manufacturers, retailers and consumers would be all the poorer.</p><p>\"Sporting goods companies are looking for technical edges.\" says Dr. Kim B. Blair, director of MIT's Center for Sports Innovation. \"The Internet has pushed the average expectation of performance up. People are used to technology in their lives and they expect it in products--they demand more performance.\"</p><p>Blair launched the MIT Center for Sports Innovation in August 1999 with a mission to provide students with hands-on experience in sports product development, with a focus on end-use application. Sporting goods manufacturers benefit because the students can provide research quickly and relatively inexpensively. New Balance, Trek, K2, Lange, Wilson and Easton are among the companies that have used this resource.</p><p>While countless materials exist that could conceivably boost product performance, sporting goods RD &amp; D experts tend to focus on those that will affect lightness, strength, vibration control and grip. Current examples include carbon fiber, metal alloys, liquid metal (an amorphous metal that forms easily to different shapes and has good rebound properties), as well as a plethora of polymers, resins, ceramics, composites and glasses.</p><p>\"Many of the advancements are coming out of the aerospace industry, and we'll also see bleed-over technology from high-tech industries,\" notes Blair. \"Right now, carbon fiber has a heavy market pull because consumers are demanding lighter, better performance.\" However, he notes, \"Carbon fiber can get stiffness and resilience into desired areas, but sporting goods companies need to be careful where they use carbon fiber or other materials.\"</p><p>Although a particular material may be strong--usually a desired characteristic--it may also be brittle or heavy. \"Often, if a material solves a huge problem, it may cause others,\" explains Win Fream, project manager at Bauer Nike Hockey. For this reason, mixing and matching materials, and developing new processes, are gaining importance.</p><p>Matt Arndt, director of baseball and softball products at Easton, concurs. \"Lightweight and strength are two must-haves, but they work against each other. Basically, stronger is heavier. But with [new materials], we can achieve strength with lighter weight.\" He adds, \"Metal technology and composites are amazing. A lot of R &amp; D now concerns combinations of materials [such as] carbon, glass, resin and composites.\" The question, he says, is how to put these together in a way that's compatible.</p><p>\"Performance improvements are coming from mixed material combinations--such as mixed alloy frames on bikes--rather than from a totally new material by itself,\" explains Blair. \"People are playing with foam metals and metal sandwich constructions in the aerospace industry, but these haven't hit sporting goods yet.\" Incidentally, foam metal looks like a sponge, but is metallic. It offers stiffness without a lot of weight.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>Blair points out that many companies are now looking at polymers for use in such products as bike frames and tennis racquets because of their vibration-dampening abilities. Polymers are also being used in grip tapes because of their non-slip, friction-absorption properties. \"Anytime you have vibration, it annoys the athlete and impedes performance,\" Blair says.</p><p>According to Fream, it is more important to look at how materials affect performance features and serve the needs of the consumer than at how a material fits into a specific product. \"Materials are generally chosen for their aesthetics, expense, and playability/performance. We also look at marketability issues,\" he says.</p><p>In the never-ending pursuit of new materials, RD &amp; D gurus often take a \"blue sky\" approach by looking beyond the sporting goods sector and into other realms such as the aerospace, automotive, medical and high-tech industries. In addition, suppliers, frequently seeking to capitalize on their own R &amp; D investments, bring new materials to sporting goods manufacturers.</p><p>\"Easton develops a lot of materials and we get actively involved with suppliers rather than just taking what's offered,\" says Arndt. \"Having a staff that's able to do this--such as metallurgists and chemists--helps enormously.\"</p><p>Additionally, manufacturers are not shy about approaching their vendors with specific needs and requests. \"If we need something to stick together, we call DuPont--they're great at that,\" remarks Fream.</p><p>And lest anyone forget, \"There are a lot of entrepreneurs out there, too, who have new products and concepts,\" Blair says. \"And a lot of ideas come from the athletes themselves.\" By surveying this broad landscape and then bringing new materials in-house and experimenting with them, sporting goods companies are able to offer real innovation.</p><p>\"What drives the industry is finding new designs and materials that allow changes in a product design. It is important to allow R &amp; D to focus on a material in general, and then apply it to a product,\" says Arndt.</p><p>Moreover, asserts Brian Dillman, Wilson's VP of global marketing, \"Knowing the sport and knowing the way you want a product to perform determines the materials.\" He notes that Wilson typically spends nine months to two years testing materials in a given product. \"Materials and designs will drive the industry in the next few years,\" he says.</p><p>While gaining access to the latest and greatest materials is of paramount importance, so is cost--particularly in the sporting goods industry, which is known for having low margins. So, does unobtanium's high price put it totally out of reach of the market? Not necessarily.</p><p>\"You don't close your eyes to how much a material costs, but if it has a significant impact on product performance, you try to pursue it,\" says Fream. \"Most advances in materials move down-market as they get older in the product line.\" Blair notes that improvements of traditional materials also help bring lower-priced \"exotics\" into products.</p><p>\"If a new material allows you to make a better product, the product will tend to be high-end and the market will usually accept it,\" Arndt says. \"It all depends on what product the materials will be going into.\"</p><p>Arndt points to Easton's use of Scandium (an aluminum alloy) in baseball bats to increase batting power as such an example. \"It took Easton a year and a half to put Scandium into its products, but now the material is almost commonplace in the baseball bat market,\" he says. \"Bats have gotten so good that leagues and sports governing bodies have imposed performance limitations. As a result, comfort, swing weight, feel and durability have become the most important properties.\"</p><p>With increasing numbers of new materials, material mixes and processes becoming more readily available, product customization figures to be the next big trend on the horizon. \"Personalized design is coming, but the tools are not quite ready yet,\" comments Blair. \"It's an obvious extension of custom fit, especially in bikes.\" At present, categories holding the most customization potential include golf, tennis and bike.</p><p>\"The sooner sporting goods manufacturers can start addressing personalization, the better,\" asserts Blair. \"There is a huge market for weekend warriors in terms of improved, high-end performance.\"</p><p>--JUDY LEAND</p><p>FEEL-GOOD FUTURE</p><p>Activewear that delivers spa-like benefits? Bio-based fibers that feel like cashmere? Technical outerwear held together with glue? These concepts may sound far-fetched, but they are planned for the very near future.</p><p>Textile companies around the globe are bringing a whole new set of innovations to market. From fibers to fabrics to garment construction, the latest technologies are broadening the scope of apparel properties like never before. By borrowing from other industries, and/or tapping into fresh resources, suppliers are creating products that greatly exceed traditional clothing characteristics of warmth and weather protection.</p><p>Advances in micro-encapsulation and nanotechnology are opening the door for fabrics that have a wide range of extended performance features--such as clothing that does everything from moisturize and massage the skin to help alleviate the symptoms of a cold. New fabric finishes will update everyday apparel with high-tech performance. Common apparel annoyances like stains, odors, wrinkles, fading and static cling will all soon be things of the past.</p><p>New construction techniques are also emerging. Growing interest in adhesive bonding is changing the look and feel of garments while simultaneously offering manufacturing efficiencies. The result is super-lightweight, sleek-looking, smooth-to-the-skin apparel with speed-to-market availability.</p><p>For instance, a new bonding product called Sewfree has rapidly caught the attention of several industries. In just three years, this bonding film, which launched in lingerie and moved on to applications in lifestyle and athletic wear, is now showing up in technical outerwear.</p><p>\"I can't say adhesives will replace sewing, but it will certainly compliment sewing and provide exciting options,\" says Chris Parlee, director of marketing and promotions for Bemis, the Shirley, MA, firm that developed Sewfree. The company recently opened a Hong Kong office to service the growing demand for its film in apparel end uses.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>WHAT'S HOT</p><p>Textile companies seem especially keen on performance categories that boast naturally derived fibers, wellness features, and specialty properties.</p><p>\"Just look at the success of the grocery chain Whole Foods and the cosmetic line Aveda. That trend of environmental awareness translates to textiles,\" explains Karla Magruder, who has spent her textile career bringing new products to market. She says that right now, consumers want things that don't hurt the environment. Products to watch in this category are Cargill's Ingeo corn-based line, a new soy protein fiber from China, and a product from Scandinavia derived from moss.</p><p>Hindered in the past by less-than-appealing aesthetics, the latest crop of organic fibers has an improved hand. \"The new soy product from China is being promoted as an alternative to cashmere,\" says Magruder, who recently established the firm Fabrikology in Hoboken, NJ, to focus on educating the trade on textile trends.</p><p>Wellness is another strong lifestyle trend with textile applications. Companies in the United States, Europe and Japan have recognized a consumer demand for clothes that deliver cosmetic and other well-being benefits. New apparel will be available that not only raises oxygen levels, but also reduces cellulite. Making news here are Lycra Body Care from Invista, Skintex from Cognis, and a new product from Austria called SeaCell that uses seaweed.</p><p>Lycra Body Care uses fiber micro-encapsulation technology to deliver moisturizing benefits. Moisturizing agents stored in the fiber structure--as many as a million microscopic capsules per square centimeter of fabric--break open and release their contents progressively as garments move against the skin, continuously hydrating it. Two nourishing formulas are available: skin moisturizing aloe vera, and chitosan, a marine extract with skin-soothing properties.</p><p>Lycra Body Care's massage properties are the result of combining textile compression technology and temperature management in special high-tech hosiery yarns. A gentle massaging action works vitamin-rich nutrients into the skin. Currently, this is a legwear product, but it has potential for other end uses.</p><p>Cognis, a global chemical supplier, has a new program that incorporates cosmetic ingredients into active clothes. Referred to as \"Wellness to Wear,\" the product Skintex comes in a variety of compositions. These include moisturizers, anti-cellulite properties, a hair retardant and an ingredient that promotes tanning.</p><p>According to Cognis, which has offices in North Carolina, the garment is treated with microcapsules consisting of a core of active ingredients surrounded and protected by a natural polymer. When the microcapusles come into contact with the skin, the encapsulated actives are continuously transferred from the garment to the skin.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>All sorts of textiles can be treated with Skintex with applications suitable for sportswear, hosiery and underwear. \"We are able to use our expertise in the cosmetics business to develop textiles with new wellness characteristics,\" says Brian Francis, Cognis Corp.'s business manager for performance textiles. \"We are dedicated to this market segment.\"</p><p>Schoeller also pinpoints health as a key direction for textiles in the future. The company plans to address this with a combination of technologies that integrate such things as vitamins and natural essences into fabrics.\" Just think if there was a shirt you could wear that would treat a cold,\" suggests Christine Jenny, chief relations officer at Schoeller AG, Switzerland.</p><p>Currently, Schoeller is making headlines with its innovations in nanotechnology. The Schoeller NanoSphere product repels heavy-duty stains like red wine and coffee, yet has the look and feel of sophisticated fabric. \"The technology is very consumer-friendly,\" says Jenny. \"People understand the benefits easily, unlike other new technologies that are not as visual.\"</p><p>Schoeller now applies nanotechnology to fabric. But Jenny believes the ability to apply the technology while in the yarn stage is a viable future development. \"We view the potential for nanotechnology as almost endless,\" she says.</p><p>--EMILY WALZER</p><p>YOUNG, TALENTED AND NOT LEBRON</p><p>Any discussion of the next great sports star nowadays begins and ends with LeBron. But while the undeniably talented \"King James\" may be the only teenager out there with a $100 million Nike contract to his name, he's not the only young pup turning his chosen sport on its ear.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>The evolution of a young athlete from phenom to superstar to icon takes more than talent and marketing. Sometimes it coincides with the emergence of a genre of sport (Tony Hawk) or a confluence of cultural impact with record-breaking talent (Tiger). No doubt the next great superstar will be wealthy and famous. But it's the intangible qualities, not the fame, that makes a legend. There is even a chance the \"next\" great one may come from outside the traditional sports realm.</p><p>\"At my school, kids are definitely into individual sports,\" says 14-year-old climbing wunderkind Daniel Woods, one of the athletes spotlighted above. \"I don't really climb in order to get attention. When you see LeBron James it seems like he is doing all this just to make money and be famous, but I'm sure he also has a love for playing his sport.\"</p><p>Here's a look at a few athletes who are operating with slightly less fanfare than LeBron, but with unprecedented success.</p><p>--CARA GRIFFIN</p><p>RETAILERS GET TECHY</p><p>The merchants are finally entering the computer age. Many sporting goods chains have turned to technology to cut costs and automate back-office functions such as logistics, warehousing and transportation. But only recently have they started using technology in a big way to boost sales, and the rollout of these innovations promises to shake up how merchandising is being done on the sporting goods selling floor.</p><p>Some of this technology is out front, such as kiosks at REI delivering 45,000 pages of content online to help consumers find information about products and activities. Customer loyalty programs, now a primary customer retention tool, also have their foundation in technology, as do cash-generators such as store credit cards and gift cards.</p><p>But many of the advancements involve software that provides real-time tracking of inventories, sales transactions and purchase orders to help chains better plan assortments prior to the season, as well as react to in-season demand. Some of these tools also analyze pricing to uncover the optimal initial price when an item hits the selling floor, as well as the best prices for promotion and clearance.</p><p>The tools have already greatly improved collaboration between store managers and the corporate office for many chains as they move to a centralized inventory management system. Sales transactions were previously downloaded overnight, but are now updated every few minutes. This constant monitoring enables stores to react speedily to out-of-stock hot items, while also allowing them to pull back on orders and reduce markdowns of poor sellers.</p><p>Bernie Brennan, managing partner at Charlotte, NC-based SportsOneSource, says retailers are recognizing that markdowns are their largest expense, and are turning to merchandising and pricing software for help.</p><p>\"It's really all about getting the assortments right at each store,\" says Brennan. \"While it sounds basic, without contemporary systems, it's almost impossible.\"</p><p>For many chains, retailing becomes more complex as they expand. But merchandising has always been difficult because many categories are seasonal and others are fashion-driven, including sports teams becoming hot (or cold) overnight.</p><p>\"You've got huge peaks in how this product gets bought,\" says Peter Charneff, chief product officer at JDA Software Group, which provides merchandising management systems for The Sport's Authority, Dick's, and Galyan's. \"And the number of SKUs at some sporting goods chains is rivaling department stores, so you're getting into major assortment management.\"</p><p>At the same time, assortments have to be tailored to regional needs, a feat that becomes harder as chains expand across states. \"The challenge is managing this very large assortment that needs to be somewhat localized,\" says Charneff.</p><p>Scott Friend, vice chairman and president of ProfitLogic, which provides merchandise optimization solutions, believes that the ability to better tailor assortments is critical in competing against Wal-Mart.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>\"Wal-Mart is not about understanding their customer but is all about efficiency and delivering product at a low price,\" says Friend. \"Specialty retailers such as sporting goods chains are in a unique position because their assortments are pretty narrow, and that puts them in a position to understand their customer on an intimate basis.\"</p><p>Hans Kantor, chief information officer at Modell's Sporting Goods, says a big win from of its recent shift to a centralized inventory system was gaining \"real-time replenishment.\" This is particularly beneficial when dealing with events such as the Yankees' recent trip to the World Series.</p><p>\"To be able to have my merchants watch POS transactions take place as they happen and react to it as far balancing inventories and ordering products is phenomenal,\" says Kantor.</p><p>The upgrade also allowed Modell's to enhance its frequent shopper program with an \"instant gratification\" benefit, whereby customers gain a pre-determined dollar-off coupon at the register when they make purchases beyond a set Modell's Value Plan (MVP) threshold.</p><p>REI reports that a switch to Marketmax's financial and assortment planning systems has allowed the chain to create better-targeted assortments for its customers in different regions. \"Marketmax offers a nice bundle of tightly integrated applications,\" says John Strother, REI's director of inventory and logistics. \"We go from an environment where data is entered in multiple spreadsheets and all tied together through people and a few batch applications, to an environment where you can count on data moving where you need it, when you need it.\"</p><p>Canada's Forzani Group last year rolled out a new POS system and a store WAN (wide area network) using VPN (virtual private network) technology in order to provide all stores access to the chain's centralized computer system.</p><p>\"What this allows us to do is create web-based applications centrally so all stores can access them,\" said Debbie Gillis, Forzani's chief information officer. This enables to stores to look at inventory at other stores.\" Also, if there are any pricing or UPC questions, that can also be accessed centrally,\" Gillis adds.</p><p>Forzani's new systems will enable centralized returns, and many store reports and documents can be processed centrally. In 2004, Forzani will go live with JDA Portfolio Merchandise Management to upgrade its core systems and provide the foundation for efficiencies in supply chain and merchandise replenishment. Southern CA-based Chick's Sporting Goods revamped its back-office systems last year to improve inventory replenishment and open-to-buy management. \"We became much more efficient at getting information out quicker to buyers, department managers and even vendors,\" says Erin Diebold, Chick's director of IS and accounting. Communications were improved between stores to enable centralized credit and check authorizations, and the chain also launched a successful gift card program.</p><p>In addition, Chick's recently rolled out e-mail to department managers to communicate transfer requests, as well as price changes and markdowns across the chain. Previously, such information was relayed by truck and this change allows Chick's buyers to quickly react to sales reports.</p><p>Salt Lake City-based Sportsman's Warehouse also noted a \"180 degree turnaround\" as it shifted to a centralized inventory system this year. The former system--which included nightly downloads that processed information from each store well into the next morning--become increasingly inefficient as the company added more stores. \"Now we have real time information of everything that's happening at corporate and at the store level. We can move very quickly,\" says Mike Van Orden, Sportsman's chief technology officer.</p><p>Some chains are also putting tech-power behind their sales forces. In '04, Forzani will utilize labor scheduling software that allows stores to chart peak selling periods, thereby allowing retailers to make sure enough staff is on the sales floor at the right time.</p><p>At Modell's, an upgraded POS system will allow the chain to roll out wireless RF (radio frequency) guns, enabling store personal to quickly verify prices and process sales transactions.</p><p>A shift to wireless POS registers is allowing G.I. Joe's to hold an increasing number of outdoor events. \"Wireless has become so much cheaper and so much more reliable,\" notes Marc Mieher, chief information officer at G.I. Joe's.</p><p>A seismic shift will come with the emergence of RFID (radio frequency identification), which promises to allow retailers to seamlessly track inventory from production to the retail selling floor. This technology, which is expected to replace the bar code, can scan a whole basket of goods in one swoop, and will drive self-checkout across retail. On the downside, a lofty price and lack of standards will likely delay the rollout of this technology until the latter part of this decade.</p><p>For now, the big tech payback is expected in merchandising, especially as retailers begin to capitalize on customer data mining with frequent-shopper programs and credit cards to create customer-specific marketing programs.</p><p>\"The better you can get at your data, the better you can drive sales and profits,\" states Marketmax's Gene Gsell, chief marketing and sales officer at Marketmax.</p><p>--THOMAS J.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019. However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing. A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by a consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019.</p><p>Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing. A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019. Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a breakup of big tech, which could more formally separate AWS from the Amazon mother ship and unwind significant mergers such as the one with Whole Foods.</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup and one that Amazon will be looking to prepare for.</p><p>\"I think this is highly likely,\" says Halliwell. \"If they're smart they are already thinking about how to do this proactively to prevent regulatory intervention.\"</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure.</p><p>\"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum.</p><p>\"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.</p><p>This has given it the agility to move into adjacent industries quickly and with success. And it seems unlikely to stop any time soon.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos said that he spends most of his time thinking a minimum of three years out. That's likely an understatement,\" says Mazour. \"Amazon has always had a vision way beyond any reality that their customers experience in the now.</p><p>\"Where it goes next, whether that's drone-based deliveries from floating warehouses, physical stores with no need for tills or shop assistants, or fully automated smart homes which predict and order what you need without you even asking, we don't know.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing. A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019. Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a breakup of big tech, which could more formally separate AWS from the Amazon mother ship and unwind significant mergers such as the one with Whole Foods.</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup and one that Amazon will be looking to prepare for.</p><p>\"I think this is highly likely,\" says Halliwell. \"If they're smart they are already thinking about how to do this proactively to prevent regulatory intervention.\"</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure.</p><p>\"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum.</p><p>\"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.</p><p>This has given it the agility to move into adjacent industries quickly and with success. And it seems unlikely to stop any time soon.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos said that he spends most of his time thinking a minimum of three years out. That's likely an understatement,\" says Mazour. \"Amazon has always had a vision way beyond any reality that their customers experience in the now.</p><p>\"Where it goes next, whether that's drone-based deliveries from floating warehouses, physical stores with no need for tills or shop assistants, or fully automated smart homes which predict and order what you need without you even asking, we don't know. But I bet Bezos does.</p><p>\"High though it sounds already, the trillion-dollar valuation that Amazon commands is just the beginning.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing. A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019. Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a breakup of big tech, which could more formally separate AWS from the Amazon mother ship and unwind significant mergers such as the one with Whole Foods.</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup and one that Amazon will be looking to prepare for.</p><p>\"I think this is highly likely,\" says Halliwell. \"If they're smart they are already thinking about how to do this proactively to prevent regulatory intervention.\"</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure.</p><p>\"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum.</p><p>\"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.</p><p>This has given it the agility to move into adjacent industries quickly and with success. And it seems unlikely to stop any time soon.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos said that he spends most of his time thinking a minimum of three years out. That's likely an understatement,\" says Mazour. \"Amazon has always had a vision way beyond any reality that their customers experience in the now.</p><p>\"Where it goes next, whether that's drone-based deliveries from floating warehouses, physical stores with no need for tills or shop assistants, or fully automated smart homes which predict and order what you need without you even asking, we don't know. But I bet Bezos does.</p><p>\"High though it sounds already, the trillion-dollar valuation that Amazon commands is just the beginning.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing. A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019. Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a breakup of big tech, which could more formally separate AWS from the Amazon mother ship and unwind significant mergers such as the one with Whole Foods.</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup and one that Amazon will be looking to prepare for.</p><p>\"I think this is highly likely,\" says Halliwell. \"If they're smart they are already thinking about how to do this proactively to prevent regulatory intervention.\"</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure.</p><p>\"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum.</p><p>\"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.</p><p>This has given it the agility to move into adjacent industries quickly and with success. And it seems unlikely to stop any time soon.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos said that he spends most of his time thinking a minimum of three years out. That's likely an understatement,\" says Mazour. \"Amazon has always had a vision way beyond any reality that their customers experience in the now.</p><p>\"Where it goes next, whether that's drone-based deliveries from floating warehouses, physical stores with no need for tills or shop assistants, or fully automated smart homes which predict and order what you need without you even asking, we don't know. But I bet Bezos does.</p><p>\"High though it sounds already, the trillion-dollar valuation that Amazon commands is just the beginning.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

On that day 25 years ago, 30-year old \"Wall Street whiz-kid\" Jeff Bezos finally packed in his comfortable hedge fund job to set up an online bookstore from a garage in Seattle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Bezos's brainchild is the second most valuable company in the world, worth US$928 billion, and is described as \"the most powerful brand\" on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's reach and growth seems limitless.</p><p>But as Bezos said to his employees recently: \"Amazon is not too big to fail. In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\"</p><p>Bezos may be right. As the company looks to the next step in its seeming bid for world domination, it will still need to face down challenges from both consumer and regulatory headwinds.</p><p>Amazon's activities in the retail sector are perhaps the most recognized, and the most criticized. However, in a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos even said that Amazon was still \"a small player in global retail\".</p><p>Retail sales at Amazon have risen from US$51 billion to US$59.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019. However, growth has slowed dramatically. In North America, revenues increased 17 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2018, with international growth dropping to nine per cent from 34 per cent.</p><p>But there are problems brewing.</p><p>A U.S. federal court ruling last week that Amazon can be held liable for a dog collar sold on its website that partly blinded a woman could complicate the online merchant's business if it is applied broadly.</p><p>More than half the items sold on the popular site come from independent merchants. Amazon takes a commission on sales and charges additional fees for storing products in its warehouses, packaging them and delivering them.</p><p>But it technically doesn't own the inventory, a fact it has used to protect itself from product liability cases. A report by consumer group called Which? found that unscrupulous sellers are beating Amazon's security systems with tactics such as bribery and hacking to post fake reviews for their products.</p><p>The watchdog said features designed to make the online giant's website more user-friendly were being \"abused on a grand scale\" to mislead customers.</p><p>These challenges haven't stopped Bezos from innovating and making aggressive acquisitions such as the US$13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 - but whether his approach will pay off remains to be seen.</p><p>\"There are two types of retailers in the world today. Those which will be replaced by Amazon, and those which won't,\" says Ivan Mazour, chief executive and founder of AI-powered customer marketing platform Ometria. \"Amazon's all-encompassing vision will provide us with all of our 'needs'. But our 'wants'will continue to be satisfied by innovative 'direct to consumer' brands.\"</p><p>While Amazon certainly will have its eyes on the future of retail, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now its most profitable business. Launched in 2002, AWS has quietly established itself as one of the most prominent technology platforms in the world and is on track to earn US$31 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Essentially selling cloud computing and storage as a service, AWS is used by 5,000 government organizations worldwide, institutions such as NASA and huge companies like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>AWS currently commands a 32-per-cent share of the cloud service market, far ahead of closest competitor Microsoft at 16 per cent. And its revenue grew 41 per cent for the first three months of 2019. Although that is a dip from 2018's 49-per-cent increase.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Google are placing more emphasis on their cloud services, from video game streaming to connecting machines around the world. But while this new focus will be a threat, Amazon is already entrenched.</p><p>\"Microsoft is probably the biggest threat to Amazon in the cloud market,\" says Andy Halliwell, U.K. retail lead at digital consultancy Publicis. \"But across the spread of industries that Amazon operates in, it will take a number of partners or a conglomerate working collaboratively to overthrow their dominance.\"</p><p>Possibly the greatest threat to Amazon in the coming years is antitrust laws, competition commissions and even consumers suffering from \"Amazon fatigue\" deciding enough is enough.</p><p>\"How long will we, the public, allow it to grow and extend its monopoly?\" asks Halliwell.</p><p>\"How long will the Competition Commission and Federal Trade Commission allow Amazon to extend its monopoly? \"We've recently seen changes in federal attitude to the big tech firms. I think we'll see this play out very quick in the run-up to the U.S. elections.\"</p><p>Indeed, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a breakup of big tech, which could more formally separate AWS from the Amazon mother ship and unwind significant mergers such as the one with Whole Foods.</p><p>The company also continues to face scrutiny over work conditions in warehouses and the company's tax contributions.</p><p>The U.S. government is gearing up for a major probe into big tech, which could lead to a significant breakup and one that Amazon will be looking to prepare for.</p><p>\"I think this is highly likely,\" says Halliwell. \"If they're smart they are already thinking about how to do this proactively to prevent regulatory intervention.\"</p><p>Mazour, however, is not so sure.</p><p>\"Out of all the tech giants, Amazon is the one which has the lowest risk of being broken up,\" he says. \"It has competed fairly at all times, and won through effective execution rather than by blocking others.\"</p><p>Regardless of government intervention, Bezos's observation that even Amazon is at risk in the long term means that the company will need to focus on other growth areas to preserve its momentum.</p><p>\"I would argue that e-commerce, cloud and AI are its more mature industries and not its key growth areas,\" says Halliwell. \"Amazon will also see significant growth in its supply chain and logistics businesses over the next three years.\"</p><p>That has been the key to Amazon's success in the last 25 years. Ever since it began life as a Seattle garage bookstore, it has looked to expand and explore, interlinking its businesses with its deep engineering and technical capability.</p><p>This has given it the agility to move into adjacent industries quickly and with success. And it seems unlikely to stop any time soon.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos said that he spends most of his time thinking a minimum of three years out. That's likely an understatement,\" says Mazour. \"Amazon has always had a vision way beyond any reality that their customers experience in the now. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Four main trends suggest the environment that allowed companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft to flourish might not exist for much longer: the stifling dominance of top tech giants; changing investor attitudes; increased scrutiny from regulators, the media, and the public; and a growing emphasis on ethical capitalism. As a results, the tech industry will likely experience major shifts, including: the decline of micro-targeted advertising, more rights for gig workers, a sorting of direct-to-consumer startups into big winners and many failures, and a pivot to \u201cconscious capitalism.\u201d The grand result will be slower, but more sustainable growth throughout the industry.       Charles O\u2019Rear/      Over the last 20 years, Silicon Valley has benefited from a once-in-a-lifetime alignment of advantages. American primacy, the ubiquity of cheap capital, the arrival of the smartphone (among other widely adopted tech innovations), and, perhaps most significantly, a benign regulatory environment have all conspired to create a historic concentration of wealth and power. The titans of the Valley and their heirs have been free to roam far ahead of lawmakers, watchdogs, and tax codes.    That might not be true for much longer, however. Despite the fact that many public tech companies saw their valuations skyrocket during the lockdown and that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated mass adoption in e-commerce, online payments, telemedicine, and video conferencing, there are signs that the gilded age for consumer internet businesses may be drawing to a close.    There are four main driving forces behind this.    First, the near total dominance of the top tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Microsoft \u2014 has become stifling. These companies not only hoover up top talent, but have grown to such a size and expanded into adjacent markets to such an extent that they are starving all but the best new tech businesses of oxygen. Smaller companies who compete in one of the markets that Big Tech considers as strategic \u2014 an ever-expanding list \u2014 risk becoming a target of full financial power of one of the giants, who aim to crush or buy possible contenders before they grows beyond a certain size. This hegemony impacts innovation and centralizes capital allocation.    Second, triggered in part by the  poor post-IPO performances of Uber and Lyft  \u2014 as well as smaller companies like Casper, SmileDirectClub, Super League Gaming, YayYo, and the WeWork/SoftBank debacle \u2014 investors, both private and institutional, are calibrating their approach. They are tightening requirements for additional financing to reflect the fact that a clear path to profitability, and not just exponential growth or \u201c blitzscaling ,\u201d is now considered key. This, combined with the pandemic hitting certain sectors especially hard, has exposed some startups as having suspect business models. In the absence of easy access to funding, whether because of the pandemic or because of pre-crisis problems, a number of them have seen their investors withdraw and were  forced to close .    Third, regulators, the media, and the public at large are now far more familiar with the downside of tech and the multiple ways the promises made to consumers have been broken. Mass privacy breaches , voter manipulation , disinformation , more precarious working arrangements ,  life-threatening products , or the outlandish behavior of certain founders were largely tolerated five years ago, mainly because of public ignorance and faith in tech bro mantras such as \u201c Move fast and break things \u201d and \u201c We\u2019re making the world a better place .\u201d Today, the tech industry receives much more critical scrutiny, as the cost of the industry\u2019s unfettered reach and toxic side-effects \u2014 such as how social media and personalized search results make us more skeptical about science and more hardened in our opinions , or how short-term rentals drive rent increases \u2014 becomes increasingly clear.    Fourth, similarly, the public mood has decidedly shifted and expectations for tech to be accountable for their impact on society have grown. As the tech giants have reached market caps equivalent to midsize national economies, expectations and moral obligations have grown, too. Facebook has a market cap of more than $700 billion, up from $240 billion just five years ago , while Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are now trillion dollar-plus companies. Even the Business Roundtable, America\u2019s most influential group of corporate bosses, has taken to cheerleading \u201ccapitalism with a conscience\u201d with their 2019 statement on the purpose of a corporation asserting a \u201cmodern standard for corporate responsibility.\u201d    All of these trends point to a reckoning on the horizon. In September, according to Pew Research , 73% of Americans said they were not very confident or not at all confident in the ability of tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to prevent the misuse of their platforms to influence the 2020 presidential election. Separate research found that 85% of respondents felt Big Tech has too much power. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a growing expectation on both sides of the Atlantic for tech companies to pay their taxes fairly and in full ,   rather than play the tax minimization game they\u2019ve been able to get away with for so long; researchers at Fair Tax Mark , a U.K. nonprofit that campaigns for tax transparency and justice, identified a gap of $155.3 billion between the expected rate of tax and the cash taxes actually paid by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and Microsoft between 2010 and 2019.    Against this backdrop, it\u2019s clear the typical tech business templates of the past couple of decades are no longer going to cut it \u2014 from either a business or societal perspective \u2014 for companies who plan to be around, let alone thrive, 20 years from now. The ready availability of investor cash coupled with sky-high revenue growth expectations that incentivized the use of predatory pricing (where VC billions are used to keep prices of, say, an Uber ride or a DoorDash delivery artificially low to undercut competitors), the exploitation of independent contractors in the on-demand economy, the algorithms that fuel outrage to increase time spent on social media platforms, and the advertising optimization encouraging privacy shredding micro-targeting are under threat and unsustainable.    What then will the tech business models of the future look like? Given the changing conditions outlined above, thriving in the next era of tech will likely involve meeting a different set of goals. While it is something of a taboo in the Valley (and on Sand Hill road in particular) to say so, tech\u2019s new era will very likely see slower, yet more sustainable growth and reduced profitability.    All these changes in funding, regulation, and public sentiment will likely alter key aspects of the scale-first current business models I\u2019ve described \u2014 and disrupt existing sources of revenue. Based on my 15 years working in tech as an executive for large tech companies and a consultant for the Boston Consulting Group and now 18 months writing a book about how to make Big Tech more empathetic and human-centric, I believe we\u2019re about to see some major shifts in this rapidly evolving environment \u2014 and that there may be new opportunities for a different kind of tech company:    The micro-targeted advertising model will increasingly be under attack and will weaken: Due to growing concerns around privacy invasion the dissemination of conspiracy theories and voter manipulation, look for companies to move away from the micro-targeting approach used by Twitter, Facebook, and Google/YouTube. The value of this model has been contested , and scandals related to hate speech, privacy violations , data breaches and more, have flourished. Web-based advertising platforms will likely limit micro-targeting to a very narrow subset of categories and advertisers, while moving towards some kind of \u201cfreemium\u201d model, more acceptable to regulators and users.  More rights for gig workers and the end of \u201czero hours\u201d contracts: Because of changing attitudes and user and customer pressure , \u201cdisruptors\u201d of physical consumer businesses such as Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and DoorDash will likely be forced to offer protections to full-time equivalent workers. Ultimately this will result in these companies being somewhat smaller and less profitable than the FANGAM-style tech giants their investors envisioned, which may well make this model less attractive to VCs seeking outsized returns. But new companies in this space, freed from the bottomless brunch of venture cash, have an opportunity to become genuinely profitable and sustainable from the get-go.  There will be big winners and many failures in the direct to consumer (D2C) and online product subscription model: Over the past decade there has been much buzz around D2C businesses for physical goods online, such as Dollar Shave Club, Harry\u2019s, The Honest Company, and Casper. In theory by cutting out the middleman (i.e. the retailer), D2C companies can sell their products at lower price points than legacy brands, and double-down on product. But it turns out that D2C isn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. It\u2019s not that the model is unviable per se, just that most D2C businesses haven\u2019t really built any domain expertise: Their products aren\u2019t necessarily better, they haven\u2019t mastered digital marketing, and their unit economics are less attractive than at first glance because of acquisition costs and lack of scale. There are also too many of them, which is why only the biggest and best run D2C companies will win, and many will fail. Yet out of these ashes, new business opportunities will emerge. As consumer demand continues to shift online, I believe we are going to see a new generation of platform infrastructure businesses that will help any consumer brand become a D2C player. These platform infrastructure businesses (e.g., Stripe and Shopify) will benefit from the aggregation they create \u2014 you can\u2019t be a master of digital marketing with one small D2C brand, but you can if you have 100. This trend will also power legacy brands to transition faster to D2C.  Companies that focus on \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d and empathetic tech will have an advantage: In an era where consumers demand higher ethical standards from all brands, all of the leading tech companies will increasingly be expected to exercise their power with far greater responsibility and will be held accountable by regulators, users, boards/investors, and even their own staffs (something we\u2019re seeing more and more of ) to make the right trade-offs. These decisions include: 1) Whether to benefit from high user engagement from outrage and right-wing populism on platforms or provide a universal communication platform free from disinformation, bullying, and hate through stricter standards (Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube). 2) Whether to offer consumers lower prices with less vetting or limit inventory by cracking down on bogus or potentially dangerous products or situations (Amazon, Airbnb). 3) How to support legitimate security efforts of democratic governments without enabling surveillance, profiling and government overreach (Google, Microsoft, Apple). The list goes on. While the last thing I\u2019m suggesting is that all startup founders/legacy CEOs should turn to social entrepreneurship and build B Corps, value-based and empathy-driven companies make business sense: A study of exceptionally conscious firms demonstrated that they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of 10.5 between 1996 and 2011.    While the convergence of these trends means some businesses will disappear altogether or be significantly downsized, others will thrive, albeit with different business models and economics, alongside reduced expectations and growth trajectories. Still, there is a wild card in all this: the regulators. As businesses are pushed towards monopoly and aggregation to achieve the profitability and competitive advantage required by the markets, increasingly hawkish regulators will likely turn towards antitrust and hands-on oversight and interventions \u2014 and the big question is how far they might go. The uncertainty around future regulators\u2019 actions on both sides of the Atlantic is particularly high given how the looming economic crisis renders protectionism and the defense of national champions increasingly tempting. My hope would be that the combination of industry-led initiatives, increased consumer scrutiny, and balanced regulation will help tech goes back to its original aspirations of being a force for good and of progress for humanity.    Interestingly this shifting landscape creates in my view a unique opportunity for legacy businesses \u2014 not just for them to pivot digitally, but to become the Platforms 3.0. Legacy businesses have a huge advantage in that they know how to operate in the physical world, they have marketing teams, who know how to build and sustain brands, and crucially they know how to operate profitably in multiple territories within the law.

The government could also seek a stay to halt the transaction from moving forward as it weighs that decision, but the Justice Department would have to decide by Monday. Leon made clear that he would reject a stay, but the DOJ could also seek such a ruling from the Court of Appeals.Delrahim told reporters that the Constitution and its laws \"allow for due process for all litigants and we will take a look at what the next steps are.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/president-trump/\">President Trump</url> has yet to weigh in on the ruling, but it has revived company claims that his opposition to the transaction, and disdain for CNN, influenced the decision to bring the case.A Time Warner executive vice president and spokesman, Gary Ginsberg, made it clear that they think politics were involved. He said on Tuesday that Leon's \"resounding rejection of the government's arguments is confirmation that this was a case that was baseless, political in its motivation and should never have been brought in the first place.\"Delrahim\u00a0has denied that Trump influenced the decision to sue to block the merger.Leon's opinion did not delve into those questions, as he rejected efforts by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jeff-zucker-cnn-2020-election-att-1202845074/\">AT&amp;T</url>-Time Warner to pursue such a line of defense.He also wrote in his opinion that \"the temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than the resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\"That did little to quell consternation among an array of public interest groups and antitrust lawyers that the stakes were so high in the case that it naturally will have an impact on future enforcement.The Justice Department will face just those questions very quickly with another potential vertical media merger unveiled on Wednesday. Comcast submitted its offer for many of the assets of 21st Century Fox, one to rival a Walt Disney Co.-Fox combination that was announced in December. Comcast made clear in its proposal that it had been awaiting the AT&amp;T decision.Matthew Polka, the president of the American Cable Association, which represents smaller cable providers, has already called on the Justice Department to block a Comcast-Fox combination, saying that it would \"only increase its ability to harm consumer welfare.\"He said that the government, including the DOJ and FCC, \"should continue to rigorously review existing and proposed vertical combinations and impose sufficient remedies to offset their harms.\"Others worry about the fallout from the DOJ's loss of the case.\"If [the AT&amp;T decision] is not going to be a chill on antitrust enforcement, I don't know what is,\" said Gigi Sohn, fellow for the\u00a0Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law &amp; Policy and former counselor to FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. \"The Antitrust Division is going to be disinclined to challenge vertical mergers.\"She wishes that the Justice Department would have pursued an argument that had to do with access to the internet, or net neutrality, but the FCC recently rolled back many of those rules.Ketan\u00a0Jhaveri,\u00a0former antitrust attorney at the Justice Department's telecommunications task force and co-CEO of legal tech platform Bodhala, suggested that Leon's opinion will make \"the government tremendously gun shy.\"\"This is the nightmare scenario,\" he said, given the high-profile nature of the case.He also said that it could change the dynamics of the way that companies key up their proposed mergers. Because of AT&amp;T's victory in court, \"Comcast is going in [to its Fox deal] saying, 'Not only do we have fear that the government will block the deal because of vertical concerns, we don't even need to offer these conditions.'\"Diana Moss of the American Antitrust Institute said in a statement that\u00a0\"this setback in antitrust enforcement, coupled with the recent rollback in network neutrality rules is a 'one-two punch' for competition and consumers.\"Others questioned the Justice Department's strategy. Hal Singer, principal at Economists Incorporated, said the AT&amp;T decision shouldn't stop the Antitrust Division from challenging vertical mergers, particularly ones where economic modeling shows a significant impact on consumers.In the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case, the government's expert, Carl Shapiro, concluded that the cost of the merger to pay-TV subscribers was at least 27 cents per month, but the companies attacked his methodology, and Leon found the projections unconvincing.\"Someone has got to make the call at the DOJ to ask, 'What is the threshold at which we will sue to block a merger?'\" Singer said. If the predicted price increase is in the pennies, like it was in the AT&amp;T deal, the DOJ should be willing to reach a settlement with \"behavioral\" conditions placed on the transaction that guide competitive conduct, he said. \"If it is a material effect on prices, then by all means sue,\" he said.But Delrahim has criticized so-called \"behavioral\" remedies as ineffective, and says that they put the Justice Department in the position of acting as a regulator. He said that he favors permanent \"structural\" solutions, in which merging companies agree to divest assets. In the case of AT&amp;T-Time Warner, the DOJ said that they would approve the deal if the companies sold DirecTV or gave up control or divested the Turner Networks. The companies refused, and the government filed its lawsuit.Outside of court on Tuesday, Delrahim told reporters that the decision \"does not change our view that a structural remedy is the best way to protect American consumers.\"A number of groups are urging the Justice Department to appeal, but the burden will be on the government to show where Leon made a mistake in applying the law.Jhaveri said there could be an opening for a DOJ argument in how Leon characterized the relevant competitive landscape. The Justice Department said it was the traditional universe for live pay-TV subscribers, while AT&amp;T-Time Warner argued that they face an increasingly competitive landscape of big tech rivals like Facebook, Netflix, and Google.In his opinion, Leon wrote that \"although the government is of course correct that the refrain 'we are getting killed by new competition in different markets' is no 'defense to an illegal merger,' I simply cannot evaluate the government's theories and predictions of harm, as presented by the Government at trial, without factoring in the dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers view video content.\"Jhaveri also said Leon \"bought the AT&amp;T argument that the reason to do the deal is so that they can have a digital ad model like Google and Facebook.\" The government could again argue that\u00a0such a claimed benefit of the deal wasn't merger specific, and that AT&amp;T could pursue such a platform without the Time Warner transaction.Polka said that Leon's decision was \"out of the mainstream.\" He argued that it was counter to \"numerous findings over the past 15 years by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice that vertical combinations between video programmers and distributors require robust conditions to constrain the incentive and ability of the combined firm to raise prices to rivals and reduce choice.\"The trouble in bringing an appeal, though, is that Leon \"ripped apart every single basis for the claims of anticompetitive effects,\" Singer said. Perhaps most importantly, Leon found flaws in the methodology for the economic model that the government used to show consumer harm, Singer added.\"Let's say [Leon] got it wrong on the diversion rate,\" Singer said. \"But there are so many other infirmities, I don't see how you salvage this.\"\u00a0Related stories      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jeff-zucker-cnn-2020-election-att-1202845074/\">Jeff Zucker Will Stay at CNN Through 2020 Election</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/cbs-showtime-paramount-att-time-warner-roseanne-1202844400/\">CBS, Showtime, Paramount Execs Talk AT&amp;T-Time Warner, 'Roseanne'</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/trump-north-korea-media-1202844311/\">Trump Criticizes CNN, NBC for Coverage of North Korea Summit: 'Fake News' Is America's 'Biggest Enemy'</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1202844806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJJ-24M1-JC3V-64BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1397\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002SBL</classCode><className>TIME WARNER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

We asked some experts, and one thing is clear: Whoever lands behind the wheel should expect full throttle from Day One.Jeff Reid, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business and the founding director of the school's entrepreneurship initiative, said success will flow from an improved corporate culture, which could start with filling the company's numerous senior vacancies[5]\u00a0with 'people with great integrity and the right gravitas.''I think the first thing you've got to do is clean up the culture. And that means putting the right people in place,' Reid said. </p><p>The right management team, and accompanying management systems, will signal to employees, customers and Uber drivers 'that things are truly going to change.'Having the right people in place starts at the very top, Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert on corporate strategy and entrepreneurship, explained to HuffPost in an email. Uber doesn't need a visionary anymore, they need a capable pair of hands to steer the ship. Rawley said Uber needs a new CEO who is an outsider, with experience running a big tech company.'Uber doesn't need a visionary anymore, they need a capable pair of hands to steer the ship through some known challenges,' Rawley explained. Those challenges include 'fixing the culture, competition with Lyft, international competition, fixing or selling off the autonomous car business, dealing with regulators, [and] managing driver relationships.'Reid and Rawley both said Uber also needs to put serious effort into recruiting and hiring a trustworthy chief financial officer.Uber has attracted substantial amounts of outside investment, but it's no secret the company is burning through money and needs to get its cash flow under control.'The biggest issue for Uber is how to generate enough cash to fund internal investments,' said Rawley. 'If they have to go back to the capital markets with so much red ink flowing, the current investors will take a huge haircut on their investment.'Rawley also suggested a new Uber leadership team may view this as an opportune time to raise prices to help increase cashflow, and to bring in an external consulting firm like McKinsey .... 'to 'professionalize' the organization.' You have to keep the drivers happy at the same time you're investing in technology that might replace them. That's not an easy task. As for self-driving cars, Reid said it makes sense for Uber to continue devoting significant resources to develop the technology. He noted a new CEO will have to focus more on the company's drivers as well.'You have to keep the drivers happy at the same time you're investing in technology that might replace them. That's not an easy task,' Reid said. 'But if you stop doing the things that are clearly manipulative in relation to drivers, that's a good first step.'Despite substantial challenges, Reid was optimistic about Uber's potential.'Uber has transformed the transportation industry. If they continue to innovate and work on the core business model, then I think they should continue to be successful,' Reid said. 'But the self-inflicted wounds are significant.'The CEO role isn't Uber's only vacancy. Take a look at how much the company's top leadership has crumbled[6] in the last six months: This article originally appeared on The Huffington Post <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-new-ceo-challenges_us_594a81cbe4b00cdb99cbcbc4?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-new-ceo-challenges_us_594a81cbe4b00cdb99cbcbc4?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/uber?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/uber?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/travis-kalanick?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/travis-kalanick?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-resigns-uber-ceo_us_594a07c9e4b0177d0b8a5aac?utm_hp_ref=uber...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-resigns-uber-ceo_us_594a07c9e4b0177d0b8a5aac?utm_hp_ref=uber...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-resigns-uber-ceo_us_594a07c9e4b0177d0b8a5aac?yl5...d=inblnkushpmg00000009...d=inblnkushpmg00000009...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-resigns-uber-ceo_us_594a07c9e4b0177d0b8a5aac?yl5...d=inblnkushpmg00000009...d=inblnkushpmg00000009...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-leadership-infographic_us_59404b02e4b09ad4fbe3d71f?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-leadership-infographic_us_59404b02e4b09ad4fbe3d71f?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-leadership-infographic_us_59404b02e4b09ad4fbe3d71f?2d7...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-leadership-infographic_us_59404b02e4b09ad4fbe3d71f?2d7...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB124721149807437708225176100163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-124721</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NVD-S231-JCMN-Y0K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><timeReceived>7:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Huffington Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 21, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>uber</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ceo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>autonomous cars</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Travis Kalanick</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

Inc.'s YHOO[1] request for a tax-free spinoff of its remaining stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding LtdBABA[2], things appear to be a bit uncertain for the tech giant.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p>The company also withdrew its request for an IRS ruling.&lt;nl/&gt;Is There a Plan B?&lt;nl/&gt;The Yahoo! stock has fallen over 25% in the past three months. This seems to indicate that investors are expecting a multibillion-dollar tax bill when Yahoo divests its Alibaba GroupHolding stake. Even analysts believe that there is a less than 50% chance that Yahoo would be able to spin off its Alibaba stake in a tax-free manner.&lt;nl/&gt;But Yahoo!'s legal team believes that most probably the tax-free spin will succeed.&lt;nl/&gt;But what if it doesn't? Analyst Neil Doshi from Mizuho SecuritiesUSA believes that Yahoo! has choices beyond the spinoff. He suggests that Yahoo! can divest the core operating business into a new operating entity, which would help to save on taxes. One more option would be selling the holding to a foreign company.&lt;nl/&gt;The Spin-off Story ...e Ensuing Troubles&lt;nl/&gt;Yahoo! announced in January its plans of returning $40 billion in holdings to shareholders by spinning off its stake in Alibaba. The 15% holding or 384 million shares of the Chinese e-commerce company, currently valued at about $23 billion after a huge decline in the value of Alibaba this year, was to be spun off into a newly formed, tax-free independent, publicly traded investment company called Aabaco.&lt;nl/&gt;Following this, it filed a request with the IRS in February seeking a ruling to allow it to spin off its stake in Alibaba along with its Small Business Division. The basic idea of tagging an active or legacy business to the pile of stock was to make the spinoff of that stockpile tax-free.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;In May, rumors of the IRS planning to change the rules concerning tax-free spinoffs made the rounds. The change in regulations could jeopardize Yahoo!'s plans for a tax-free spinoff of its stake in Alibaba.&lt;nl/&gt;On Sep 2, the IRS informed Yahoo! that it would not issue a ruling. Yahoo! said that the U.S. tax authority did not conclude definitively that the deal was taxable under U.S. law. So Yahoo! has no plans of abandoning its spinoff plan.&lt;nl/&gt;The spinoff is likely an effort to make sure that Aabaco shareholders benefit from the future sales of Alibaba stock and are taxed at a lower rate than Yahoo! would have to pay had it held on to its interest in Alibaba.&lt;nl/&gt;The recent development can create major roadblocks for Yahoo! as the spinoff is a critical step for chief executive officer, Marissa Mayer. The company has lately been under pressure from Starboard Value LP and other investors to return cash to shareholders, spin off Alibaba shares, find ways to cut taxes and keep away from major acquisitions.&lt;nl/&gt;It will also disappoint shareholders who invested in Yahoo!, hoping they would get a tax-free payout, when the deal closes by the fourth quarter of 2015.&lt;nl/&gt;Conclusion&lt;nl/&gt;Currently, the spinoff doesn't seem to have a clear path and options might seem blurred. But Yahoo! being a big tech company would definitely have other tax avoidance strategies in mind.&lt;nl/&gt;Possibly, the investors also to some extent believe that as reflected in yesterday's price movement. Yahoo! rose 2.01% to $31.52 in Wednesday's trading session.&lt;nl/&gt;Yahoo! carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the space include Amazon.comAMZN[3] and Open Text CorporationOTEX[4], both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).&lt;nl/&gt;Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As Silicon Valley grapples with its version of becoming too big to fail, Zuckerberg and his industry peers might take lessons from Wall Street, whose leaders have some experience with government scrutiny.</p><p>Although it won't address all of Big Tech's problems, a simple rule that bolsters the banking system could do a lot to clean up some of the uglier aspects of social media that Zuckerberg felt compelled to apologise for.</p><p>The concept is \"know your customer\" \u2014 or KYC, as it's called on Wall Street \u2014 and it's straightforward: Given concerns about privacy, security and fraud when it comes to money, no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background.</p><p>The idea of applying such a rule to social media has been floated before, but it has so far failed to take hold. Now may be the right time.</p><p>Consider this: Facebook has said it shut down more than 1.5 billion fake accounts from April through September last year). That was up from the 1.3 billion such accounts it eliminated in the six previous months. To put those numbers in context, Facebook has a reported user base of 2.3 billion.</p><p>What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do? You'd probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots.</p><p>First, let's acknowledge the practical considerations. Vetting the vast universe of those on social media would be a gargantuan task.</p><p>When I broached the idea of applying a \"know your customer\" principle to their business, several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect, questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat, especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards, and even fixed street addresses can be hard to come by.</p><p>Then there are the legitimate complaints about Facebook and its ilk already knowing too much about users. Who would want them to know even more? And what would the companies do to protect personal information better than they have in the past?</p><p>After all, not long ago, Facebook disclosed that tens of millions of user passwords had not been stored securely.</p><p>But the stakes may be too high not to consider some kind of heightened verification process.</p><p>Facebook and Twitter, at least, clearly appreciate the importance of verification as a concept: Both offer blue-check-mark programmes to confirm the authenticity of a small percentage of users, like celebrities.</p><p>If the vetting of legitimate users were expanded, and the number of phoney ones were reduced, the amount of hate speech and fake news polluting the social media platforms would almost certainly dwindle. And it would be hard for the companies to wilfully ignore what remained.</p><p>How would it work? A modified version of what goes on in the financial services industry is one possibility.</p><p>When you open a bank account, you typically have to provide your name, address, Social Security and date of birth. That information is cross-checked against databases to ensure that you're a real person, that your credit score is solid and that your name doesn't appear on a list of \"politically exposed persons\" that could put you at risk for bribery or corruption. The verification is also used to determine whether you have a criminal record that suggests possible money laundering or identity theft.</p><p>That kind of vetting helps protect banks from doing business with criminals and helps protect clients who could be vulnerable to fraud.</p><p>There is a precedent for adapting such a regimen for social media: NextDoor, a social network that helps people communicate in their local communities, won't let new users sign up unless their addresses can be verified.</p><p>A would-be NextDoor user must submit a credit card or phone number, which the site cross-references against databases. If you don't have either, the site sends a postcard to your address with a code you can use online.</p><p>The good news is that NextDoor knows its customers very well. The bad news is that its verification process would be extremely difficult to expand widely and quickly.</p><p>The company doesn't disclose user numbers, only that it is in more than 200,000 neighbourhoods. Reports suggest it has tens of millions of users, a far cry from the billions using more popular social networks. If introducing such a system at that scale is too daunting, testing it in the US and Canada first might be one way to start.</p><p>The need for a \"know your customer\" rule could take on a new urgency as social networks evolve to become fully encrypted private-messaging services, as Zuckerberg has indicated he plans to do with Facebook.</p><p>\"I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,\" he said.</p><p>It's a laudable goal, but if the users are fake, or otherwise unaccountable, from the outset, the ease with which they could spread misinformation on encrypted networks would have even more troubling implications.</p><p>That is, unless, there was a viable mechanism for vouching for individual identities \u2014 for networks to know their customers, as it were.</p><p>It just seems like common sense.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/45/155501287895.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/45/155501287895.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-142221256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVX-YBJ1-JDJN-605G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

Until now. On 27 December, the Competition &amp; Markets Authority announced a full investigation into Amazon's tie-up with Deliveroo.  </p><p><br/>It will be \"hugely damaging\" to both companies, according to Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital. The deal delays and legal costs - the CMA's investigation will run until June - is like \"sticking pins in your eyes and paying for the privilege\", he says. <br/>So why is it happening now, and what is the likely outcome? <br/>It stems from Deliveroo's announcement last May that Amazon would acquire rights and a minority shareholding after leading a \u00a3450m funding round in the delivery business.  <br/>The CMA's initial investigation concluded the tie-up could damage competition in the online restaurant delivery sector by discouraging Amazon itself from re-entering it. The tech giant had previously competed with Deliveroo with its Amazon Restaurants business, but pulled the plug on that service in 2018 after two years. Evidence from Amazon's internal business documents and interviews with senior management pointed to a \"material likelihood\" of re-entering the market - but only without the tie-up, according to the CMA.  <br/>The CMA also fears the deal could damage competition in the emerging market for ultra-fast convenience grocery delivery. Amazon offers one-hour delivery through its Fresh service in 300 postcodes in London and the south east, but Deliveroo dominates in the UK, partnering with the likes of Co-op on rapid deliveries from 400 stores as well as hundreds of independent convenience stores in London. <br/>Missed deadline <br/>Concluding that the tie-up \"could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services\", the CMA gave Amazon and Deliveroo five working days from 11 December to address its concerns with legally binding proposals. Having not received any such proposals within the timeframe, it referred the deal for an in-depth investigation on 27 December. <br/>But there is more to this than the concerns set out in the CMA's initial findings, according to Alan Davis, head of competition at Pinsent Masons. The authority is under increasing pressure to make such big calls, he says. Competition authorities worldwide are facing criticism for allowing so-called 'killer acquisitions' among tech giants, in which a dominant firm acquires a smaller competitor to \"eliminate credible future competition\" (think Facebook and Instagram).  <br/>The CMA's changing approach was seen in its investigation into PayPal's acquisition of iZettle, which began in late 2018. In that case, the authority initially said it believed if the transaction didn't go ahead, PayPal would likely invest in its own mobile point-of-sale payment devices. In June last year, following an in-depth investigation, the CMA's concerns were allayed, and it cleared the transaction unconditionally. <br/>The Amazon-Deliveroo investigation also comes after a report was published by the CMA last month into \"how major online platforms like Google and Facebook operate\" amid concerns their dominance \"may have become entrenched with negative consequences\" for users in the \"rapidly developing digital economy\".  <br/>\"The CMA wants to ensure that it is at least seen to be scrutinising transactions of this nature in the digital sector [more] carefully,\" Davis says. <br/>The outcome of the investigation could see Amazon forced to unwind its stake, but the authority is playing a risky game, says Nicole Kar, head of UK competition at Linklaters. \"The irony is that if [the CMA rejects the deal], it might place Deliveroo in some jeopardy,\"   <br/>The CMA will also find the kind of solid data its investigations typically rely on, in addition to forecasts, to be thin on the ground, says Black. The action is based on \"hypothetical, theoretical work on how they see the market developing\" for which they must have \"really good eyesight\".  <br/>The investigation is, as Black puts it, a signal that \"big tech America\" should expect \"greater regulatory challenge, not just scrutiny\", from the CMA. But where that leads is unfamiliar territory for both.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEGRO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEGRO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-GXP1-JCP9-23XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168088</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

But even as Trump signed that executive order in Washington, renewable energy advocates out West were doubling down on their efforts to clean up the power grid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At stake is the future of solar farms, wind turbines and coal plants across 11 Western states, and a proposal from California<person><nameText>Gov. Jerry Brown </nameText></person>to bring them all under the umbrella of a unified power grid. Brown thinks a unified grid would bolster clean energy and reduce electricity rates, by making it easier for California to sell excess solar power to other states and import cheap wind power from Wyoming and New Mexico. But his plan has divided environmentalists, some of whom fear it would actually help the coal industry, or give Trump an opportunity to attack California's climate policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many climate advocates support Brown's proposal. A coalition including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Silicon Valley tech companies and clean energy firms launched a new push for the governor's Western grid plan Tuesday, urging Golden States lawmakers to authorize the expansion of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's electric grid.</p><p>Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of NRDC's energy program, said the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>backsliding on climate change makes it more important than ever for California to work with other states.</p><p>\"At a time when the Clean Power Plan is under threat, the fastest and cheapest way to enhance renewable energy across the West is full Western grid integration,\" Cavanagh said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's something we can do regardless of federal policy to advance a clean energy expansion across the West that's already well underway.\"</p><p>But critics see Trump's love affair with fossil fuels as a reason to be wary of Brown's plan.</p><p>Expanding California's grid operator to encompass other Western states would require a series of approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which should be controlled by Trump appointees within a few months. Critics are worried FERC would use that process to undermine California's climate policies, forcing the state to import dirty power from other parts of the West.</p><p>\"It's irresponsible and counter-productive to push for greater federal oversight of California energy policies,\" said Matthew Freedman, an attorney at the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based watchdog group that advocates for lower electricity rates and cleaner energy. \"It's surprising to hear a couple of groups get out front on this issue, especially on the same day <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announces a massive rollback of federal environmental regulations.\"</p><p>California and the West</p><p>California's leaders have vowed to fight Trump's climate and energy policies. Brown sees a unified Western grid as key to slashing emissions in California and across the West.</p><p>But with Trump in the White House, the politics of grid expansion might be too difficult to navigate.</p><p>Under Brown's grid proposal, the California Independent System Operator would start its expansion by annexing PacifiCorp, a Warren Buffett-owned utility with customers in Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and part of Northern California. Under that scenario, all six states would get some authority over the grid operator. But California lawmakers and some environmentalists are nervous about giving any amount of control to Utah and Wyoming, two deeply conservative states that harbor strong support for coal, oil and natural gas.</p><p>Brown wanted the state Legislature to approve his grid proposal in 2016, but top lawmakers balked. In a letter to Brown last year, Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n, Assembly leader Anthony Rendon and four committee chairs wrote that expanding California's electric grid \"must not undermine state sovereignty or cede authority of our state's cutting edge clean energy and climate policies.\"</p><p>Those concerns are even stronger now that Trump is president and could theoretically interfere, said Andrew Zingale, legislative director for Assemblymember Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo, who did not sign the letter.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem politically palatable,\" Zingale said in an interview last week.</p><p>Brown hoped to start the grid expansion with PacifiCorp so that California could more easily import cheap wind energy from Wyoming, which has some of the country's strongest onshore winds. PacifiCorp's leaders have been eager to link up with California's grid, seeing an opportunity to reduce their costs while also building lucrative power lines to transmit clean electricity to California.</p><p>But some grid expansion supporters have conceded that PacifiCorp and its red-state customers are a non-starter for California lawmakers. Instead, they're taking a broader approach, touting the potential benefits of a unified Western grid and urging the Legislature to pass a bill allowing the California Independent system operator to annex out-of-state utilities.</p><p>\"Had you not had PacifiCorp raising their hand and saying, 'We want to join,' you wouldn't have started with PacifiCorp. You would have started with someone closer, and frankly, more politically aligned,\" said Don Furman, a former PacifiCorp executive who now advocates for grid expansion through a coalition of environmental groups and energy companies called Fix the Grid West.</p><p>Strong opposition remains</p><p>Furman suggested California could instead partner with utilities in environmentally minded Oregon and Washington, or with NV Energy, another Warren Buffett-owned utility that covers much of Nevada. Abundant hydropower in the Pacific Northwest, Furman said, could help power California when solar plants go offline in the evening, reducing the state's need for polluting gas plants.</p><p>\"To be able to pull on (Washington's) Columbia River for a few hours would be really, really helpful,\" he said.</p><p>If California were to unify the Western United States' 35 separate electric grids, Golden State homes and businesses would save $1.5 billion annually on their electric bills by 2030, according to a study commissioned by the grid operator. Reduced energy costs would lead to the creation of 19,300 jobs in California, even as some clean energy jobs move out of state, the study found.</p><p>Those numbers help explain why some business leaders are now pushing for grid expansion.</p><p>\"Done right, big tech companies to local solar panel installers to small farms in the Central Valley would benefit from a fully integrated grid,\" Tim McRae, vice president for energy at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group - which represents companies including Apple, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft - said during Tuesday's conference call.</p><p>Critics disagree.</p><p>Some labor economists have questioned the alleged benefits to California, saying the loss of high-paying renewable energy jobs to other states would outweigh whatever job growth is spurred by lower electricity rates. And California's politically powerful labor unions have staunchly opposed grid expansion, not wanting to see jobs building solar and wind farms shipped to other states.</p><p>The Sierra Club, America's largest environmental group, also isn't convinced that grid expansion is a good idea. Club leaders worry that opening the California electricity market to coal plants in Utah and Wyoming might inadvertently prolong the lifetime of those facilities, allowing them to keep spewing climate-altering greenhouse gases - and other dangerous pollutants - for decades.</p><p>Kathryn Phillips, director of the Sierra Club's California chapter, said it doesn't make sense for the state Legislature to pass a bill allowing the grid operator to expand as it sees fit, as NRDC and other environmentalists have proposed. Instead, California leaders should carefully study which out-of-state utilities it would make sense to partner with, then write legislation specific to those utilities.</p><p>\"In theory, you would think Washington, Oregon, possibly Nevada - these states seem to be on a trajectory to move away from coal, and to increase their renewable portfolio. They seem to share some of the values California has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Phillips said. \"But what you really need to do before you hop into a situation with them is really analyze them.\"</p><p>A surplus of solar power</p><p>Over the last decade, California has enacted some of the nation's most ambitious climate policies, including a renewable energy mandate, a cap-and-trade system to limit industrial emissions and financial incentives for clean cars. De Le\u00f3n, the state Senate leader, introduced a bill last month that would increase the clean energy mandate from 50 percent by 2030 to 100 percent by 2045.</p><p>But even with those policies, meeting the state's long-term climate goal - slashing emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 - won't be easy.</p><p>Already, California is facing a new challenge: a surplus of renewable energy during the middle of the day, when solar farms have increasingly flooded the grid with more energy than homes and businesses are using. The California Independent System Operator said recently it may have to \"curtail,\" or turn away, as much 8,000 megawatts of power at times this spring, most of it solar.</p><p>Supporters of Brown's Western grid plan say California could solve that problem by sharing more electricity with other states. Solar farms could sell energy across state lines rather than shutting down when there isn't enough in-state demand. And California utilities could import wind power from places like Wyoming, to help balance out fluctuations from in-state solar and wind farms.</p><p>Cavanagh, from the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the grid operator's recent prediction of up to 8,000 megawatts of curtailment a \"wake-up call.\"</p><p>\"California shouldn't be shutting down clean energy from our solar fields and wind farms every time supply exceeds our state's demand,\" he said.</p><p>Still, California's \"too much solar\" problem is far from a crisis at this point. And it's not clear how much a unified Western grid would help. Studies commissioned by the independent system operator found that a fully integrated grid would decrease the percentage of renewable energy production California is forced to curtail in 2030, but only slightly - from 4.5 percent to 1.2 percent.</p><p>And even that estimate might be too optimistic. Under an alternate \"base case\" modeled by the private consultants who conducted the study, California would only have to turn away 2 percent of renewable energy production by 2030, even without expanding its power grid. And that \"base case\" is the one that's more likely to occur, according to comments submitted to the grid operator by all three of the state's major utilities.</p><p>\"Reducing curtailment is good, but it's not the end of the world that renewables are getting curtailed a few percent of the hours of the year,\" said Freedman, from the Utility Reform Network. \"You're using a small problem to propose a radical set of changes.\"</p><p>Trump attacks Obama's climate legacy</p><p>In his executive order Tuesday, Trump called for the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rolling back Obama's Clean Power Plan, which is designed to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to start leasing coal on federal lands again. And he told federal officials they no longer have to factor climate change into their decisions.</p><p>Trump misleadingly claimed his actions would put coal miners back to work, even though the Clean Power Plan has been temporarily halted by the Supreme Court and thus hasn't taken effect yet. Obama's moratorium on new federal coal leases hasn't hurt the coal industry much, either. Experts say the biggest factor in the industry's recent struggles has been the low cost of natural gas.</p><p>\"The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods. They told me about the efforts to shut down their mines, their communities and their very way of life. I made them this promise: We will put our miners back to work,\" Trump said during an event at EPA headquarters, where he signed the executive order.</p><p>Without the Clean Power Plan, America would almost certainly fail to live up to the commitment it made at the Paris climate summit in 2015, when 195 nations agreed to limit global warming to manageable levels. The U.S. promised to cut its climate pollution at least 26 percent by 2025 - a target researchers have said we're on track to miss, even with the Clean Power Plan in place.</p><p>\"We need to speed up our response to climate change, because rising seas, drought, flooding and wildfires will affect everyone,\" said Mary Solecki, Western states advocate for Environmental Entrepreneurs, a group of business leaders and investors that supports Jerry Brown's push for a unified Western power grid.</p><p>Still, it could take Trump's lieutenants years to repeal the Clean Power Plan - and they may not succeed. The EPA must go through the arduous legal and scientific process of showing why Obama's regulation isn't needed, or should be replaced with a less stringent rule. And the agency's conclusions will inevitably face lawsuits from environmental groups.</p><p>Another complicating factor: In 2007, the Supreme Court said the EPA is obligated to regulate planet-warming greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, if the agency were to conclude that those emissions endanger public health. The EPA reached that conclusion after Obama took office. If Trump and his EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, want to stop regulating greenhouse gases altogether, they'll need to reverse that \"endangerment finding\" - which could fly in the face of the overwhelming scientific consensus that human emissions are driving unprecedented, dangerous changes to Earth's climate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENO-ren-1767120594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N76-FXX1-DYJJ-P149-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255269</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2313\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Reno Gazette-Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Reno Gazette-Journal (Nevada)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 2, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009JAM</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS OPERATOR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

When Amazon bought Whole Foods last year, some business pundits looked at the acquisition poorly, he says.</p><p>\"But if you look at it through a business model lens, Amazon has AmazonFresh (the company's own online grocery store). It's been around for a decade, and it hasn't quite worked out. Amazon continues to invest in it. The perishable nature of groceries restricts storage time and quality is impacted during transit. The challenges to scale for Amazon were clear,\" says Dunn, citing Silicon Valley analyst Ben Thompson'sblog poston the purchase.</p><p>Thompson writes that Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw the grocery business differently and looked at Whole Foods as the customer in the transaction, not a retail operation. Whole Foods would serve as the warehouse or the factory for Amazon and help the tech company scale its grocery business. This would be a similar setup for the manufacturers and third party merchants who use Amazon's Prime and Fulfilled By Amazon services. As clients of Amazon, they give a cut to Amazon for each transaction.</p><p>Cerulli researchers however stood by their report. \"I don't think wealth management is their most attractive opportunity,\" says Scott Smith, a director at Cerulli. \"I don't think we can rule them out. But it doesn't seem the most appealing opportunity for them. There are too many regulations and it is a very splintered market.\"</p><p>That's not to say a tech giant can't get into wealth management elsewhere, Smith adds. \"The return on investment for them seems greater if they expand their businesses in new countries and doing the same thing they do and not doing something different in this country. Why would they get into a market where services are already free?\"</p><p>Still, other observers see avenues for tech giants even in the U.S. market.</p><p>\"The 'we-built-it-here' attitude bogs down large global banks and enterprise wealth management firms. It's simply the way they operate. They have huge IT departments. They are used to having everything in-house,\" says April Rudin, founder and CEO of The Rudin Group, a global wealth marketing firm. \"But in Silicon Valley, they approach things from a completely different point of view. Big tech firms become more of a distribution channel for products and services rather than thinking they have to originate everything. Amazon is not a manufacturer. They are a distribution platform.\"</p><p>Rudin surmises that such firms may become the aggregators of wealth management businesses in the future, in much the same way Facebook, Twitter, and Googlehave co-opted the news business. Amazon or Facebook could conceivably have two types of customers, she says: retail clients who use the tech companies' robo advisor that is a white label product from a fintech. The other customer could be incumbent wealth managers, who need access to customers.</p><p>Morgan Stanley, Fulfilled by Amazon, perhaps?</p><p>Rudin points out that Amazon is in discussions with big banks like JPMorgan Chase to offer checking accounts to its customers. Facebook has opened its Messenger platform to financial services' chatbots. Charles Schwab and Fidelity have been added to Amazon's Alexa.</p><p>\"These partnerships make sense,\" says Rudin. \"These partnerships amplify brands, as well as gain new prospects. It shortens the client acquisition cycle.\"</p><p>It's a matter of time before Amazon and other big techs enter wealth management, says Vikas Bansal, former principal at CAPCO and strategic advisor for FinTech Connector, a membership-based networking group for fintech entrepreneurs, business leaders and investors.</p><p>\"Basically, these are broad trends,\" Bansal says. \"They are already moving towards financial services, such as the payments space. It won't happen in the near future.There are trends pointing towards that happening in the long-term.\"</p><p>But for incumbents who don't want to be co-opted, Dunn says they need to take a page from tech companies' playbook by providing superior user experience and allow third party developers through open infrastructure to create useful applications for their institution. Incumbents should also take seriously the work being done in innovation labs within their firm and actually integrate promising products from these labs, he adds.</p><p>\"Incumbents are well-positioned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-00000162-fd7c-db76-a972-fd7cb7930000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S60-92J1-F06X-W0TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

seeking to share extreme and offensive types of content, and also those who have been booted off bigger, more widely known platforms.</p><p>\"Given its sort of signature thing is that it's much looser in terms of what people can post, it's become very popular with various alt-right and white supremacist figures who've already been kicked off bigger social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter,\" he told The Signal.</p><p>But Sommers adds that while most Gab users are looking to share \"extreme\" content that would not be allowed elsewhere, the site is not exclusively the domain of the US alt-right.</p><p>\"There are also people who like the idea that they won't get kicked off Gab in general - libertarians, people who are there because they're trying to politically support Gab and its mission, for example,\" Sommers said.</p><p>\"And there are also other communities - for instance, there was an incident recently where there was something going on with Brazilian social media so a lot of Brazilians set up accounts on Gab.</p><p>\"So essentially, communities that have sort of been exiled from other social media platforms end up on Gab.\"</p><p>Does Gab ever block users?</p><p>Yes, but not very often - and not for \"violating community standards\", like on Facebook or Twitter.</p><p>According to Sommers, the main reason Gab users are blocked by the site is for \"doxing\", or revealing the personal details online of another user.</p><p>\"Various white supremacists will be feuding, and then they'll post one another's real names in an attempt to sabotage that person, which is banned,\" he told The Signal.</p><p>\"I guess doxing is sort of the cardinal sin of Gab.\"</p><p>But beyond that, users are mostly given free rein.</p><p>So why aren't hate speech posts on Gab illegal?</p><p>The quick answer is: free speech.</p><p>In Australia, many of the more controversial memes and comments shared on Gab would fall afoul of anti-discrimination law, but in the US the First Amendment's constitutional guarantee of free speech prevails.</p><p>Professor Katharine Gelber is an expert in free speech and is based at the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.</p><p>She told The Signal that comments like those posted by Mr Bowers on Gab were protected under US law, but would likely be illegal if made in Australia.</p><p>\"It's clear under Australian jurisprudence that as long as you can see the material in Australia and access it in Australia, it's potentially regulable under Australian law,\" she said.</p><p>\"There was a very famous case in Australia of a holocaust denier who was located in Australia and who was putting material up on his website in Australia and was ordered to take it down, and complied.</p><p>\"But in the case of an internationally located social media company like Gab, it would be much, much harder for a human rights authority in Australia effectively to order that that material be removed and to have that request complied with.\"</p><p>Asked whether there was any prospect of Australian-style laws prohibiting certain types of hate speech ever being introduced in the US, Professor Gelber said no.</p><p>\"There have been attempts,\" she told The Signal.</p><p>\"For example, there was an attempt to draw up a regulation saying that a burning cross amounted to speech that would likely arouse anger and hatred on the basis of race.</p><p>\"But the US Supreme Court said that banning speech that arouses anger and hatred on the basis of race is a type of \"viewpoint discrimination\", so in that way the US First Amendment has been interpreted to mean that the Government needs to be \"neutral\" as to content - it can't say \"this content is good, and this content is bad\".\"</p><p>So will Gab face any penalty for hosting hate speech?</p><p>Yes - and in fact, it already is.</p><p>Sommers says there have been periods already when Gab has come under pressure, and in the wake of Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, public scrutiny of its practices is intensifying, with several companies pulling Gab's back-up support.</p><p>To operate, Gab relies on other internet companies for tech support - firms like PayPal, Joyent and Microsoft.</p><p>And Sommers says nowthose partners areinsisting Gab lift its game.</p><p>\"Because of the way the internet infrastructure works, Gab has to work with other companies - so they have to get, for example, Microsoft or another company to provide their cloud service,\" he said.</p><p>\"As a result, they end up in these situations where some of the most extreme stuff is being moderated because the companies that work with Gab are saying, \"otherwise we're going to shut down your site\".</p><p>But Gab's current shutdown may only prove temporary, with the platform's founder remaining defiant.</p><p>In the leaked NPR interview, Mr Torba said his company would find alternatives if some of its key partners pulled out.</p><p>\"Gab is the banned book of the internet,\" he told NPR.</p><p>\"If we have to build from the ground up our own infrastructure, our own payment processors - whatever it takes - we are not going anywhere.</p><p>\"You can 'no-platform' Gab for a little while, but you're not going to 'no-platform' the community that we have built of 800,000 people from around the world who are fighting for freedom of expression and individual liberty on the internet.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

And look at the cheap shot that invited - to say, not if you're a Sainsbury's shareholder, Mr Coupe. Indeed, his looming exit at the end of May had AJ Bell declaring: \"Sainsbury has been the worst performer of the major quoted grocery firms in the UK during Mr Coupe's time as CEO.\" It reckons total shareholder returns fell by 13 per cent. And maybe they did. But, not for the first time, such metrics fail to tell the real story.</p><p>Mr Coupe took charge in July 2014, when the discounters Aldi and Lidl were cranking up the competitive volume and internet shopping was breezily exposing all the excess space in Britain's hypermarkets. Low inflation souped up the challenge. So it says something for Mr Coupe - plus his legacy from predecessor Justin King - that he's negotiated a tough market without his rivals' bloopers.</p><p>As Bernstein analysts have noted, Sainsbury's is the \"only Big Four supermarket that did not require a major margin reset in response to hard discounter growth\". Tesco was pushed so hard it ended up with a \u00a3263 million accounting black hole and a \u00a3235 million settlement with the Serious Fraud Office and other regulators. Morrison's experiment with Dalton Philips and his \"misty veg\" ended with new managers and a turnaround. Asda's underlying sales fell for three years.</p><p>Mr Coupe managed a far less painful transition, reconfiguring the business to serve customers \"whenever and wherever they want to shop\", as he put it. His response to excess space was the \u00a31.1 billion Argos buy: no stunner, but decent enough. Taking ownership of the data-rich Nectar scheme was also a smart move in this internet age. And he's lifted digital sales to a fifth of the total.</p><p>Yet there is one memorable black mark: the mooted \u00a312 billion Asda tie-up that Shore Capital analysts were hardly alone in feeling was \"doomed from the start\". Mr Coupe spent far too much time listening to his banking and legal advisers. But somehow they all missed the arrival of Andrew Tyrie as the Competition and Markets Authority chairman. No way was his first decision going to be sanctioning a Sainsbury's-Tesco supermarket duopoly with 60 per cent-plus of the market.</p><p>Sainsbury's shares hit 309p the day Mr Coupe unveiled his Asda deal and burst into song. But they're \u00a31 lower now: down 2 per cent to 208p on news of his exit. And since the Asda farrago the \u00a33.9 million-a-year Mr Coupe has come up with little more than cost cuts: hundreds of managers only this week.</p><p>Besides, he's 60 in September and had promised his wife that he'd call it a day then: something he admits would have caused him a \"big personal issue\" if he'd landed Asda because \"I'd have needed two to three more years to see it through\". At least now he'll keep his wife happy by handing over to retail chief Simon Roberts - like Tesco's Ken Murphy, formerly of Boots.</p><p>As for Mr Coupe, he kept a diary of his tenure and is toying with an account of what it's actually \"like to do the job\". Or, as they chirrup in the musical: \"If they ask me, I could write a book.\"</p><p>                   Taxing question                   </p><p>Nowhere beats Davos for hot air on a ski slope. So no big shock to hear the latest from Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google-owner Alphabet. Apparently, artificial intelligence will be \"more profound\" for humanity than \"fire or electricity\". Really? Isn't it a bit early to tell?</p><p>Still, Mr Pichai was hardly alone in making outlandish statements. Chancellor Sajid Javid, was at it, too. He insisted that the UK \"plans to go ahead\" with a </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-to-go-ahead-with-digtial-taxes-on-tech-giants-despite-us-threat-m7t0rn6mf\">digital services tax</url></p><p> on big tech: the likes of Google and Facebook. Moreover, the 2 per cent levy could come in as early as April.</p><p>So how will that play out while Brexit Britain tries to hammer out a trade deal with America? Well, Mr Javid's fellow Davos panellist, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, made that perfectly clear: \"If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies.\" Not quite the thing UK carmakers want to hear - not least on the day JaguarLand Rover cut 500 jobs at its Halewood plant on Merseyside.</p><p>True, Mr Javid said a unilateral UK tax would only be \"temporary\" and would \"fall away once there is an international solution\". Even so, it took one of his predecessors to point out the </p><p>                   realpolitik                   </p><p>. As George Osborne told the BBC, it would be a \"very brave British government that walks into a trade war with the US\" just when the \"centre point of its economic policy\" is striking a US trade deal.

Relations with the pilots are at breaking point, too - at least to judge by the remarks of Dennis Tajer from the Allied Pilots Association, the outfit representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots. He said trust in the US planemaker had been \"crushed, blended and diced\" after its response to two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.</p><p>Yes, Boeing's new boss Dave Calhoun is showing a little more grasp of reality than his predecessor. He's put back any chance of the plane returning to service until June or July at the earliest. But that also guarantees higher production and compensation costs: a bill that could reach $25 billion on the estimates of Jefferies analysts. Or far more than the $9 billion set aside by Boeing to date. That's nowhere near enough.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-59646958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1X-MKT1-JCJY-G12W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Mark Warner, D-Va., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\"</p><p>The measure would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect.</p><p>They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them.</p><p>It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data.</p><p>At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance.</p><p>The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law.</p><p>\"Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. \"The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies ... to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.\"</p><p>The group's statement didn't directly address the issue of mandating companies to put a value on users' data.</p><p>Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising.</p><p>There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.</p><p>Warner, who amassed a fortune as a tech industry investor and executive before entering politics, and Hawley, a freshman and conservative who pursued investigations of Google and Facebook's practices as Missouri attorney general, have been especially active in the debate over big tech.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d114461018bfimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook and other technology giants harvest data about users on their platforms and make it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.

Mark Warner, D-Va., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.'When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,' Hawley said in a statement. </p><p>'These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.'The measure would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect. They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them.It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data. At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance.The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law.Advertising'Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,' the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. 'The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.'The group's statement didn't directly address the issue of mandating companies to put a value on users' data.Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising.There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.Warner, who amassed a fortune as a tech industry investor and executive before entering politics, and Hawley, a freshman and conservative who pursued investigations of Google and Facebook's business practices as Missouri attorney general, have been especially active in the debate over big tech.

Mark Warner, D-Va., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\"</p><p>The measure would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect. They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them.</p><p>It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data. At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance.</p><p>The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law.</p><p>\"Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. \"The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies ... to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.\"</p><p>The group's statement didn't directly address the issue of mandating companies to put a value on users' data.</p><p>Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising.</p><p>There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.</p><p>Warner, who amassed a fortune as a tech industry investor and executive before entering politics, and Hawley, a freshman and conservative who pursued investigations of Google and Facebook's business practices as Missouri attorney general, have been especially active in the debate over big tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Mark Warner, D-Va., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\"</p><p>The measure would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect. They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them.</p><p>It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data. At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance.</p><p>The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law.</p><p>\"Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. \"The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies ... to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.\"</p><p>The group's statement didn't directly address the issue of mandating companies to put a value on users' data.</p><p>Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising.</p><p>There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.</p><p>Warner, who amassed a fortune as a tech industry investor and executive before entering politics, and Hawley, a freshman and conservative who pursued investigations of Google and Facebook's business practices as Missouri attorney general, have been especially active in the debate over big tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Mark Warner, D-Va., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\"</p><p>The measure would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect. They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them.</p><p>It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data. At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance.</p><p>The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law.</p><p>\"Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. \"The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economy-wide federal privacy law that covers all companies ... to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.\"</p><p>The group's statement didn't directly address the issue of mandating companies to put a value on users' data.</p><p>Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising.</p><p>There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.</p><p>Warner, who amassed a fortune as a tech industry investor and executive before entering politics, and Hawley, a freshman and conservative who pursued investigations of Google and Facebook's business practices as Missouri attorney general, have been especially active in the debate over big tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-c897d4f2242047189b62b40b0ea7aadc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-7YN1-JC65-52D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><timeReceived>6:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

If you believe the tech media, Silicon Valley is dead, and the FAANG companies are so big they need to be regulated. There is no question that tech has a big black eye due to security breaches, some of their roles in fake news, and a plethora of other things that make them look like Darth Vader.  These companies are growing and in many cases planning to expand. </p><p>Google is creating a new working village in downtown San Jose that can accommodate up to 10,000. Facebook has bought new property near their current campus, and Apple announced last week that they will build a 133,000 square foot campus in Austin and add new regional centers on Seattle and L.A, on top of their new campus being built in North San Jose now and smaller one in Sunnyvale, CA. And Amazon is building two new headquarters in New York and Northern Virginia, and even Netflix has expansion plans in the works.  If these companies are in trouble, it is hard to see given that they are confident about their future and have these kinds of expansion plans in the works. It suggests they know something that the media and their detractors don'teuro;trade; understand or doneuro;trade;t want to understand and instead push the vilifying argument against them instead.  But the truth is that tech is now at the center of all of our lives and is only going to be more expansive over time. I would argue that we are only half way through what is a 70-80 year journey from analog-to-digital. We are on the cusp of delivering all types of new technologies from self-driving cars, smart cities, connected homes, along with VR, AR, AI, machine learning and robotics based technologies that will eventually encompass all that we do in our tech-driven future. Tech is on track to impact and influence pretty much every aspect of our business and personal lives.  I doneuro;trade;t want to make light of the serious issues that big tech is facing today from the possibility of some governmental regulation as well as trying to find ways to keep their customers more secure. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have a bigger problem keeping people from posting false and misleading information to the broader issue of how social media has become a threat to democracies.  All of the big tech companies understand that if they give people what they want and need in the way of digital information, services, and products, customers will back them by using their products, clicking on adds and watching more and more of their video consumption in digital formats on an array of devices. Off course, the media gets more clicks and readers if they focus on the dark side of tech. And to be fair, the dark side does need to be highlighted when its impact is truly negative and harmful. This is especially true on the subject of AI and its potential impact on our world and security breaches that cost customer's real money. However, there needs to be a balance in this type of coverage, especially from the non-tech media who only occasionally cover tech and mostly when the news is negative.  Besides tech driving our economy and being the top job-creation engine in the world, technology has played a significant role in making our lives better and makes us more productive and efficient in our every day lives. Technology in all forms is on track to drive even higher economic growth and impact our lives in many ways, which will encourage greater business and consumer demand in the future.  That is why the FAANG companies are expanding as they truly understand the fact that our transition from Analog to Digital has a long way to go. If they can keep creating products that their customers want and take necessary steps when needed to correct the negative areas that plague some of them, their customers will continue to support them, which allows them to grow and expand in the process. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCHP128926154506844209225176900159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHP-128926</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V09-R3C1-F03R-N0K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><timeReceived>5:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tech.pinions</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But in the last year or so, I've had to add another title, one I never thought I'd have: tech reporter. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the Trump era, those two topics are increasingly hard to separate. In the last year, I've written about the booming business of ''bots'' and fake accounts on Twitter and how Russian agents used fake Facebook pages to sow division and shape the 2016 presidential election. I also worked on a Times investigation, in partnership with The Guardian and The Observer of London, into Cambridge Analytica, the British-American political data firm that improperly exploited the personal Facebook data of tens of millions of American voters. To study political power today, you have to understand technology.</p><p>  That's what drew me to the story of Alastair Mactaggart, the central character in this Sunday's magazine cover story about the war over privacy. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it has become clear that tech companies like <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook not only collect extraordinary amounts of information about everyone, but sometimes deceive or mislead their own users about what information is being collected and how it is used.</p><p>  My colleagues and I have reported extensively over the last year on the enormous power wielded by tech companies over politics and commerce and on the ways in which that power can be abused. Our reporting has shed light on how poorly tech companies protect the integrity of their platforms and of the data you hand them for free, with profound consequences.</p><p>  Yet both Facebook and <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>and the broader tech industry of which they are a part, have escaped any major regulation or seriously punitive government action in the United States. (In Europe, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>was recently hit with a $5 billion fine for antitrust violations.) Even after a cascade of scandals, Washington had done almost nothing. Why?</p><p>  Mr. Mactaggart, who last year began organizing to pass a California ballot initiative restricting the abuse of personal data, turned out to be an ideal way to answer the question. For one thing, his campaign was happening in real time, and as a political neophyte, he was encountering Silicon Valley's political machine for the first time, much as most readers would be. Mr. Mactaggart was not an expert on privacy when he started; he was a wealthy real estate developer from Oakland, whose main interaction with people in the tech world was at Bay Area birthday parties and his neighborhood dog run. He more or less fell into a rabbit hole and became a little obsessed. That journey allowed me to turn an arcane and often boring subject into a compelling yarn; his education -- as a political campaigner and as a consumer -- becomes the reader's.</p><p>  That was important for me, too, as a reporter. I often write about complex policy issues, and questions surrounding data collection, advertising and privacy can be challenging to unspool in a compelling, accessible way.</p><p>  I used to write about campaign finance; that's a complicated topic, too, and it was easy to lose readers' attention. But writing about data and privacy is harder. Presidential campaigns lend a certain innate drama to stories about donors and fund-raising. Tech and social media, while in one sense nearer to people's daily lives, can seem distant and abstract. For those who have no background in programming or data science, the industry they animate can seem impenetrable.</p><p>  This is no accident. One reason Big Tech faces so little resistance from policymakers is that Silicon Valley's business seems so daunting. I find that Big Tech's lobbyists and ''thought leaders'' -- and some journalists -- implicitly and sometimes explicitly promote the idea that policymakers are too dumb, slow or unsophisticated to understand how it all works, let alone regulate something like data collection practices. This notion also helps insulate the industry from accountability.</p><p>  The story of how Mr. Mactaggart forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law is, in part, a story of the power of this idea -- and also of its flimsiness. The law he helped pass is not a panacea, and won't solve every problem raised by the encroaching powers of Big Tech. Some critics believe the law doesn't go far enough. (And many in the industry believe it goes way too far.) But the fact of it -- the political proof of concept -- has already stirred intense debate and pressure to produce even more protections for consumers, not only in other states but in Washington.</p><p>  That matters not only for consumers, but also for readers. Mr. Mactaggart is a smart guy, and he had time and resources most people don't. But he's not an expert on politics or technology. If he can figure it out, so can you.</p><p>  Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer, pushed a California digital privacy initiative.

Perhaps the bears haven't been paying close enough attention, or maybe they just don't know the actual definition of innovation. We already know that the bears have missed out on Cook's incredible financial stewardship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Innovation doesn't always mean a shiny new toy - though under Cook's guide we did get the Apple Watch, Apple Pencil, AirPods, HomePod, Siri and iCloud storage system, not to mention a slew of strong updates to the products that were originally released during the Jobs era such as the iPhone, iPad and Mac. So, under the first definition, \"the introduction of something new,\" we think it's pretty clear that Apple has been quite innovative under Cook.</p><p>If we look at innovation as \"a new idea, method, or device,\" the device launches mentioned above clearly fit under this definition. However, there is more to the story. We would argue that in addition to device launches, including the bestselling smartwatch on the planet in the Apple Watch, Apple is more innovative than any other big tech company when it comes to something a bit more intangible, privacy. Large tech companies have a choice, but stewards for their customers like Apple who choose to house as much personal data on user devices and out of their own hands, rather than in the company's cloud where it is more easily accessible to employees, hackers and even big brother (and would likely benefit the company as it could force a greater need for iCloud storage subscriptions), is incredibly innovative in a world where data is power and every company on the planet is battling for user data so they can process it, analyze and use it to better target products and advertisements.</p><p>Furthermore, we would argue that innovation on the privacy front is not only responsible for buffering Apple against regulators set on reigning in the exploitation of user data, it also is strengthening to its loyal user base. In the future, this will likely be the most material factor in allowing Apple to take on the healthcare industry, a space in which consumer privacy is of the utmost importance and compliance frameworks such as HIPAA are as rigorous as it gets.</p><p>Additionally, while some may argue that Apple is not first to market on many of these fronts, indeed smart watches, pencils and speakers all existed before Apple brought their offerings to market, we would push back that Apple has never really been a first to market company. They have always been best to market company and it's why their customer satisfaction scores set the bar for the industry. The iPhone was not the first smart phone, the iPad was not the first tablet, the iPod was not the first mp3 and the Apple Watch was not the first smart watch, either. However, each and every one of these products from Apple have redefined the gold standard in their respective categories. Coming to market with a beta-level product, as was the case with such failures like Alphabet's  Google Glass project, or Samsung's  foldable smartphone, is not innovation. Apple could certainly ramp up its own product offerings if it decided to go to market with unfinished products, but then it wouldn't be Apple. It wouldn't be the premium consumer products company that it is.</p><p>Going after growth at the expense of quality (or customer privacy) can be incredibly detrimental, as we saw with Facebook  , or the blowback Alphabet has received over certain content that made its way on to YouTube. Moving fast and breaking things (the old Facebook motto) isn't Apple's way, it is, however, the reason big techs such Facebook and Alphabet are under constant scrutiny from global regulators. Now that's not to say we don't like Facebook or Alphabet, we certainly due, but there is no denying that their growth and dominance came at the expense of user privacy.</p><p>If you ask us, working through multiple iterations until near-perfection and then improving on that design generation after generation, with an intense focus on data privacy in a world where most care more about being first than right and pulling in as much user data as possible, that's innovation. So, let the bears cry out about a lack of innovation and miss the move, and we'll be here owning and not trading shares of Apple as the company continues to develop and release premium products, enhance customer loyalty and further monetize its massive and growing installed base while opening itself up to new opportunities such as healthcare, where again, Apple has an edge thanks to its innovative data handling methods.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14945220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W19-8SC1-F00X-J1BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>1:39 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

On the line are executives at Smithereen, an addictive American social media platform caught up in the situation. At every step, the firm turns out to know more about the perpetrator than the authorities of his sovereign country. The officers are public-spirited and decent, and the criminal is not a straightforward baddie or lunatic, but the sovereignties of both state and individual are overwhelmed by the reach of a Californian data giant that knows his darkest traumas, can listen in to him, and can plumb its algorithms to understand his emotional make-up.</p><p>  The episode could be a dramatisation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis>, the celebrated book by the American social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff. Seven years in the making, it anatomises the rise of \\x93instrumentarian power\\x94, whereby firms capture data about human behaviour, process it and turn the resulting information advantage into an instrument of prediction and control. It is the tale of a new Gilded Age in which giant firms \\x96 real-life Smithereens such as Facebook and Google \\x96 have unfair and undemocratic power over states and individuals. Zuboff\\x92s thesis, like the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Mirror</emphasis> episode, leaves you briefly thinking: if only the state could wield the same data power as the top-knotted Silicon Valley billionaires. But then images of overreach and authoritarianism swim before your eyes and you think: oh God, that would be hell.</p><p>  It falls not to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Mirror</emphasis> to offer a glimpse of that other extreme but to journalists, because a world where the state wields even more data power than Facebook or Google already exists. It is Xinjiang, a mountainous region of north-west China and home to 11 million Uighurs, a mostly Muslim central Asian people. On 24 November the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) provided that glimpse, in the form of an unprecedented leak of secret Chinese government documents.</p><p>  The cache sheds light on a network of government camps \\x96 the largest internment of an ethno-religious minority since the Second World War \\x96 that can hold more than a million people. It exposes the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), the surveillance programme that decides who gets interned. The platform collects information from social media, other websites and apps, facial recognition cameras, health data and checkpoints, and uses it to identify citizens who might threaten China\\x92s one-party leadership and ethnically Han Chinese-dominated society. Things as banal as prayer and foreign travel can tip the balance. These people are often interned as \\x93students\\x94, subjected to dehumanising treatment and allowed to \\x93graduate\\x94 back into society only after they have undergone an \\x93ideological transformation\\x94. The leaks show that in one week in June 2017 the IJOP flagged 24,412 \\x93suspicious persons\\x94, 15,683 of whom were rounded up. The system\\x92s arbitrariness, driven by algorithms based partly on artificial intelligence (AI), infantilises the population and creates a paranoid atmosphere.</p><p>  You might write this off as but a ghastly peculiarity of China\\x92s techno-autocracy. Even if that were the case, there would be a strong argument for sanctions on officials and firms involved in the Xinjiang nightmare. But it is not. Xinjiang is a Petri dish for technologies and methods that can be applied elsewhere. Governments and firms from around the world got to marvel at the emotion recognition systems pioneered in the region at China\\x92s main security trade fair in the city of Shenzhen last month. And while Google or Facebook may not cooperate with Western governments to the extent that their Chinese counterparts do with Beijing, China shows how naturally Big Tech and government can rub along together; the gulf between an omniscient Smithereen and the clueless British police portrayed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Mirror</emphasis>may come to seem quaint. Zuboff has rightly argued that the West cannot be complacent about the elision of instrumentarian and authoritarian power, warning of \\x93a weakened democracy with a totalitarian leader who wants to grab control\\x85 It happened in the 20th century and can happen again.\\x94 A big-data Weimar, in other words.</p><p>  There is, however, hope in Zuboff\\x92s thesis. She notes that the original Gilded Age of monopolistic oil and railroad firms in the 19th century was tamed in the 20th century by new rules and institutions: trust-busting regulations, trades unions and eventually the New Deal welfare state (or social democracy, as it\\x92s called in Europe). One can extend her comparison: if Silicon Valley billionaires are the Rockefellers of the data age then China\\x92s leaders are the new Lenins, melding the power of data with that of the state to create an alternative, more abusively centralised model. Once more, in the early decades of a century human civilisation is faced with a grim choice between domination by private firms and domination by overmighty states. Yet once more, there is a healthier third way.</p><p>  Today, that is some form of data social democracy. States should be able to harness and tame the power of data and AI, but with clear controls and limits. New institutions must arise to mediate between interest groups. Civil society needs to step up (the campaign for the EU\\x92s new data privacy regime, the GDPR, is a good model). Most of all, sovereign citizens must hold sway over the new forms of power and be able, collectively, to curb monopolies. So where the call once was \\x93neither Rockefeller nor Lenin\\x94 and \\x93neither Washington nor Moscow\\x94, now let it be \\x93neither surveillance capitalism nor techno-autocracy\\x94 and \\x93neither Silicon Valley nor Xinjiang\\x94. Pluralism and democracy must win the day. Because \\x96 spoiler alert! \\x96 the alternative is nightmarish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jeremy Cliffe is the New Statesman\\x92s international editor</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM8-5451-DYX2-C18S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.

The latest phase started with the unusually vocal opposition of some central bankers on the ECB\u2019s governing council to restarting bond purchases, and continued with a volley of criticism from retired central banking grandees who were in charge when the euro was created. </p><p>In Germany, the debate seems close to boiling point even among academics and analysts. Handelsblatt <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/geldpolitik/polemische-debatte-ezb-verstoesst-vollkommen-offensichtlich-gegen-ihr-mandat-professoren-wettern-gegen-draghi/25174660.html\"> reported on a \u201ccurious\u201d conference</url> where criticism of the ECB got so out of hand that the host had to intervene. (The host, Handelsblatt reported, was Volker Wieland, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts whose annual report on the German economy       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sachverstaendigenrat-wirtschaft.de/en/annualreport-2019\"> has just been published</url> \u2014 with interesting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uni-due.de/imperia/md/content/soziooekonomie/svr_mv_jahresgutachten2019-20.pdf\"> dissents</url> on cyclical policy and inequality.)</p><p>The criticisms of the ECB have come in two quite different categories. On the one hand was that from sitting governing council members who disagreed with restarting \u201cquantitative easing\u201d even as they agreed that a new stimulus package was warranted. That is a reasonable disagreement, even if the public nature of the criticism was sharp by ECB tradition. These are, for all the noise, disagreements on the margin. (I wrote in September why I thought even the hawks should support a muscular stimulus package.)</p><p>On the other hand, the external criticism, especially from Germany, aims its fire at the whole direction the ECB has taken, rejecting the mainstream view of monetary policy that underpins it \u2014 and the objections are political at least as much as they are economic. The Financial Times editorial page has twice in one month warned against this over-the-top aggressiveness, first in an article defending the ECB against extraordinary attack from the earlier generation of central bankers, then calling on responsible German politicians and economists to avoid the British disease of mendacious Euroscepticism.</p><p>Here I want to address some of those broader attacks on loose monetary policy \u2014 in part because they are also heard in the US and in other economies. Handelsblatt reported that one broad area of agreement among the criticisms was that persistent low interest rates create \u201czombie companies\u201d with so much debt relative to profits that a more normal financial environment would have forced them out of business and released their labour and capital to more productive entrepreneurs. In this way, weak productivity growth is to be blamed on low, let alone negative, interest rates hindering a natural process of creative destruction.</p><p>The \u201czombie\u201d economy is not a fringe concern; it is a true problem and has been documented by <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2018/05/16/zombie-firms-kept-alive-at-the-expense-of-investment-employment-and-productivity/\"> the OECD</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1809g.htm\"> the BIS</url> (and analysed by Free Lunch). But the notion that to get rid of the zombies interest rates should go up is a non sequitur. Certainly, higher debt costs would flush out the zombies \u2014 but it would flush out good (but high-debt) companies, too, not to mention make it harder for new entrepreneurs to start up in the first place. One might as well argue that businesses should be taxed more heavily to make it harder for zombies to survive. A better view is to think that low interest rates and low taxes are both important for new, productive business to grow, and that zombies should be dealt with not by making business harder for others, but by forcing banks to show less forbearance on the loans that prop up the zombies. That, in turn, requires regulators to be tougher on banks\u2019 own foot-dragging on realising losses on bad loans \u2014 and on this, the ECB has largely been part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p><p>Another big gripe seems to be the ECB\u2019s aiming for inflation to be below but close to 2 per cent, which the former central bankers claimed constituted a recent de facto change in the definition. They added that adopting a symmetric 2 per cent target, which is now being talked about, would depart from a policy focused on price stability. The objections add up to a view that by trying to lift inflation towards 2 per cent rather than letting it drift well below, the ECB is violating its legal mandate rather than fulfilling it. But in a recent FT op-ed, this characterisation of the ECB mandate and how it has tried to fulfil it was thoroughly refuted by Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank\u2019s president from 2003 to 2011.</p><p>These charges (and more, even less reasonable ones) are thoroughly discredited in the eyes of most informed observers. So why do they not just keep resurfacing but seem to become ever more aggressive? One explanation can be found in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://a5abc4da-53b3-4a90-a130-c6e57a1df8cd.filesusr.com/ugd/b3763a_cad969162fd64705990d032654365dfd.pdf\"> new paper</url> by economists Ethan Ilzetzki, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. They find that from the euro\u2019s creation until about 2011 or shortly thereafter, the ECB\u2019s monetary policy was closer to what one would expect from a central bank aiming to stabilise <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">German</emphasis> inflation rather than (as per its mandate) all-eurozone inflation. Only more recently have ECB interest rates moved in line with a policy rule that targeted all-eurozone rather than German price stability. That break, of course, coincides with the rise in criticism especially from Germany. It is hard to escape the conclusion, then, that the criticism reflects those who never reconciled themselves to European monetary union \u2014 but were quiescent so long as that union\u2019s prime institution acted in German rather than the collective interest.</p><p>Other readables</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In my FT Global Insight article this week, I explained how Margrethe Vestager\u2019s aggressive approach to regulating Big Tech fits into a broader trend of how Europe can make capitalism work better than the US.

Its industry research finds that \u201celectric aircraft currently in commercial development for market entry in the mid-2020s could be capable of covering around 80% of business aviation departures and 60% of business aviation km between the UK and Europe in the coming decade, and around 95% of departures and 90% of km in the 2030s\u201d. This means, it argues, that a near-term ban on non-electric private flights would create a strong incentive for additional research and development to speed up the marketisation so as to keep private jet users flying. The result would be to accelerate progress in electric aviation.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Bruno Casella of Unctad finds a way to reveal <url normalizedValue=\"https://voxeu.org/article/exorcising-phantom-fdi\"> the \u201cphantoms\u201d</url> in reported foreign direct investment figures (which amount to almost 40 per cent of all FDI) to establish where cross-border capital is ultimately owned.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Numbers news</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The FT\u2019s excellent data journalist John Burn-Murdoch explains how the UK\u2019s fragmented political landscape means that in the forthcoming election, seats will be won with much smaller vote shares than ever before.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-042c47f2ff0011e9be59e49b2a136b8d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFK-20P1-DXP9-92D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><timeReceived>11:06 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

And if they persist in doing so, then it is up to regulators, like the Irish DPC, to suspend or prohibit the transfers from taking place.</p><p>However, the court also had a bit of surprise up its sleeve too.</p><p>It found that the existing legal agreement between the EU and US governing transfers of personal data, called Privacy Shield was invalid.</p><p>Privacy Shield had only been in place for a few years because its predecessor called Safe Harbour had also been struck down by the European courts because it did not provide enough protection for data.</p><p>Privacy Shield was supposed to be better, stronger and more water-tight than Safe Harbour.</p><p>But once again, the court found that the latest iteration of the accord also did not meet the mark as it did not meet the standard of protection for EU citizens which is guaranteed by GDPR.</p><p>The judges ruled that under Privacy Shield any decisions by the US national security services had \"primacy\" and this therefore \"condoned\" interference with the fundamental rights of EU citizens whose data were transferred to the US.</p><p>In other words, European citizens data was not guaranteed to be kept private once in the US.</p><p>So who won then?</p><p>That depends on who you ask.</p><p>As with all such cases there was a broad welcome for the clarity the judgement brought.</p><p>Max Schrems claimed a near complete victory, saying the court had followed his organisation NOYB's arguments in nearly every respect.</p><p>\"This is a total blow to the Irish DPC and Facebook. It is clear that the US will have to seriously change their surveillance laws, if US companies want to continue to play a major role on the EU market,\" he stated.</p><p>But likewise, Facebook also appeared to claim something of a victory, welcoming the confirmation of the validity of SCCs for transfers of data to non-EU countries.</p><p>\"They are used by Facebook and thousands of businesses in Europe and provide important safeguards to protect the data of EU citizens,\" it said.</p><p>However, a reading of the Data Protection Commission's reaction would seem to suggest Facebook might be missing the point a bit here.</p><p>The DPC welcomed the judgement and claimed that in terms of the points of principle in play, the court has endorsed its position.</p><p>But it also said that while it has also ruled that Standard Contractual Clauses used to transfer data to countries worldwide are valid, it is clear that in practice, the application of the SCCs to transfers of personal data to the United States is now \"questionable\".</p><p>\"This is an issue that will require further and careful examination, not least because assessments will need to be made on a case by case basis,\" it said.</p><p>In other words, the DPC seems to be suggesting that when the case comes back to the High Court here, and is likely then referred back to the DPC to consider Mr Schrems original complaint in light of the judgement, the DPC may find it difficult to allow Facebook (and others) to continue sending personal data to the US.</p><p>So Facebook and others may have to change what they do with my data in the future. But what are the implications of all this for my data right now?</p><p>Well one would hope that companies moving data from Europe around the world had contingency plans in place for all eventualities and so there should be no disruption to services from the striking down of Privacy Shield or from the doubt that now hangs over the use of SCCs for data exports to certain countries.</p><p>But if some of the 5,000 companies that use it were solely reliant on Privacy Shield for moving data, they will have to react pretty sharpish to put another legal mechanism in place, or stop sending the data to the US and store or process it in Europe instead.</p><p>Data that is deemed \"essential\" can continue to move backwards and forwards without any great concern.</p><p>That includes emails, airline bookings, messages or direct private use of US based services.</p><p>And transfers of data that do not contain personal data also can continue, like streaming services for example.</p><p>In essence though, it is unlikely that your favourite social media platform, messaging service or other app will stop working overnight tonight.</p><p>It all sounds pretty costly</p><p>Yes, undoubtedly it has created a big headache not only for the European Commission, US government and regulators, but also for companies.</p><p>Firms would have incurred costs in setting themselves up to be certified under Privacy Shield, and they will now incur additional cost moving to SCCs.</p><p>Such alternatives may also not be as flexible a mechanism too, as the companies have to conclude separate contracts with each processor that they send personal data to. There will therefore be costs here too.</p><p>But doing nothing is not an option either, because the fines for not adequately protecting user data under GDPR are potentially huge, at 4% of global turnover or \u20ac20 million.</p><p>Perhaps particularly ironic though is that it seems in taking this case, the Irish DPC has potentially brought a raft of new work down upon itself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1153787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CB-S2B1-F16V-S4F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><timeReceived>7:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Staring directly into the camera, the Facebook CEO offered by far his biggest mea culpa. He looked, for lack of a better word, scared:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He should be. The revelations that Facebook's platform was used by Russia to target politically divisive ads represents a systemic threat to the empire that Zuckerberg has built in just 13 years. The threat doesn't come from its loyal users or from disgruntled advertisers or growing competition. Facebook has shown its ability to keep users happy, advertisers spending, and competition at bay.</p><p> The Russian controversy is about one thing that keeps Facebook executives up at night: government regulation.</p><p>Facebook is now having to work with the government and, in the process, give politicians an idea of just how big and powerful it has become. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, has led the charge here, and Democrats are pushing the Federal Election Commission to begin regulating online advertising in the same way it handles TV advertising.</p><p> Zuckerberg called the notion that fake news spread through Facebook had an impact on the election \"crazy.\" His tone has changed, as exemplified by Thursday's video. So has the company's entire treatment of the situation. It had initially said it could not reveal the ads\u2014now it's handing over 3,000 of them voluntarily.</p><p> The change of heart is not a coincidence. Facebook can't avoid this anymore\u2014it can only manage how bad this situation turns out. Now, it's going to need to do everything in its power to placate the U.S. government and try to convince politicians\u2014and an increasingly skeptical public\u2014that it will handle the situation.</p><p> The near-term for Facebook looks relatively safe. The Donald Trump administration has shown just about no interest in enacting aggressive new rules or even in enforcing old rules. The Democrats don't have enough power to actually push through any real changes in the FEC, let alone through Congress.</p><p> That said, this is a long game that Facebook has to play\u2014and Zuckerberg knows it. Facebook will outlast the Trump presidency, and will need to make sure it is well positioned to keep the government at arm's length even in case of a President Elizabeth Warren or other pro-regulation advocate.</p><p>Facebook is far from alone here. Google has had to play plenty of defense when it comes to U.S. government regulation. Tech companies are now some of the biggest spenders in the Washington D.C. lobbying industry. Sometimes that money goes to things like promoting immigration reform. Other times it goes to thinktanks that espouse the virtues of tech and how it shouldn't be regulated (or lay people off who don't think that way).</p><p> Big Tech's aversion to regulation is entirely understandable. Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been allowed to grow into massive companies with no regulation. Along the way, they have destroyed their competitors and fundamentally changed their core industries, primarily advertising and retail sales. Regulation, at this point, would only dent growth and create opportunities for smaller competitors.</p><p> The prospect is very real, thanks primarily to Europe. European regulators have aggressively pursued tech companies over a variety of different issues including data privacy and anticompetitive practices. A variety of fines have been laid on tech companies, most notably $2.7 billion on Google over its shopping search results.</p><p>Facebook had been able to almost entirely avoid U.S. government regulation. Now, the social network is at the center of a controversy that techno-skeptics would have had a tough time predicting even a few years ago. But we should have seen it coming.</p><p> When Facebook was caught manipulating users' emotions in 2014, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said Facebook would never try to control elections. The implicit assumption there was that Facebook had indeed built a platform capable of doing such a thing\u2014and had made that platform open for use to anyone with money.</p><p> The reality that Facebook has been used for this purpose now speaks to how little oversight the social network has been under. Zuckerberg on Thursday pleaded his case that Facebook is the best regulator of Facebook and that the company was launching a variety of efforts to make sure something like this never happens again.</p><p>Facebook has given little reason to believe they are willing or capable of doing so. Self-regulation is the basic corporate move when having to admit something as monstrous as helping a foreign power influence an election. The company has routinely showed that it is riddled with errors\u2014particularly within its vaunted ad platform\u2014that seem to go uncorrected until noticed by outside observers.</p><p>Facebook didn't win Trump the election. It helped. And it helped in a way that violates U.S. law. It helped in a way that violates U.S. law because its platform was engineered to be the most advanced advertising system in the world and be open to everyone. This is the same reason it has helped people target anti-semities or avoid people of color. It is unregulated. Anything goes. The market decides.</p><p> The lack of regulation has made Facebook into a $500 billion company. Facebook will do what it must to make sure it remains free of regulation. Even playing ball on the Russia investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Image: Mashable composite/chris mineses Image: Facebook screenshot</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-4521f3aa76f239e3eadff76fe46d3d1d55b524b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ9-77K1-JBCN-42H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It has harmed competition and consumers. That's illegal under EU antitrust rules.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was more from Ms. Vestager: \"It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. ... This decision requires Google to change the way it operates, and to face the consequences of its actions.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The consequences</emphasis></p><p>A 2.42-billion ($3.62-billion) fine, the biggest in an EU competition case. Now, Google made almost $90-billion (U.S.) in revenue in 2016, but the EU calculated its fine based on the company's European revenues from the comparison shopping service. It gets much more expensive if Google doesn't comply with the order within 90 days: further fines start arriving every day calculated as 5 per cent of its daily average global revenue (more than $12-million a day).</p><p>\"We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,\" said Kent Walker, Google general counsel, in a blog post.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How were consumers harmed?</emphasis></p><p>They probably weren't hurt directly. Many of the most dominating Internet companies prefer to use their market power to crush rivals, not raise prices on consumers, as is outlined in the recent book Move Fast and Break Things by Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California.</p><p>\"In America, we've taken this stance that the only thing that matters is what [former U.S.] Justice [Robert] Bork called consumer welfare; essentially the idea being that if Amazon bought every retailer in the whole nation but prices didn't rise, then it would be okay,\" says Mr. Taplin, reached by phone at the Aspen Ideas Festival. \"The EU is going back to the more classic view, of what anti-trusts were, that you need to maintain competition in the marketplace, and that government needs to protect the smaller player against the bigger and more powerful player.\"</p><p>In a world where Facebook has more than two billion users and is doing its level best to copy every feature of the much-smaller Snapchat to drive the rival social network out of business, there are clearly steep barriers to competition, Mr. Taplin said.</p><p>\"There is no market solution to these problems, nobody's going to start up a startup to challenge Google ... no one is going to take on that suicide mission.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it over now?</emphasis></p><p>No, Google has two more EU probes on the horizon, one about its search ad business, the goose that lays the company's golden eggs. The other for its dominance in smartphone operating systems, which offers less direct revenue to Google, but which puts its software and essential services front and centre in about 80 per cent of the 362 million new handsets sold in 2016. If Tuesday was any indication, Google could be facing more orders to change its business or pay up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google's enemies take a victory lap</emphasis></p><p>This excerpt from a letter penned by several big tech and media companies offers some tough medicine: \"Google and its allies will no doubt continue to press through its lobbying and public relations machine the fiction that any adverse decision amounts to European 'protectionism.' As U.S. based companies, we wish to go on record that enforcement action against Google is necessary and appropriate, not provincial. We have watched Google undermine competition in the United States and abroad.</p><p>Google operates on a global scale and across the entire online ecosystem, destroying jobs and stifling innovation.\"</p><p>The signatories included Oracle Corp. (an online advertising competitor and frequent patent litigant against Google), and Yelp Inc., a rival in local search and business discovery services.</p><p>Also among the signatories was News Corp., whose CEO, Robert Thomson, tore into Google at a London tech conference on June 14, alleging Google's claims that its search algorithms were neutral is an elaborate fiction: \"There is a contradiction between the claimed sophistication of Google's ability to target audiences and track taste for advertisers and its inability to identify the tasteless, the terroristic, the perverted and the pirated.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not all rivals are happy</emphasis></p><p>Notably, Microsoft Corp. did not sign the letter - even though it lobbied for almost five years, under then-CEO Steve Ballmer, against Google at the EU and other national competition bodies.</p><p>But on April 22, 2016, Microsoft confirmed reports that it had agreed to stop working against Google. \"Microsoft has agreed to withdraw its regulatory complaints against Google, reflecting our changing legal priorities,\" the company said at the time.</p><p>\"We will continue to focus on competing vigorously for business and for customers.\"</p><p>Just days earlier, Canada's Competition Bureau had decided against taking any regulatory action against Google's search ad business, despite years of lobbying for action from Microsoft and other tech rivals. The U.S. FTC ended probes into different Google businesses in 2002, 2010 and 2013, in some cases after receiving assurances of voluntary business practice changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20170628rbibgoogleeuexplainer</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NWR-8821-JCRP-C30X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But with the possibility that one chamber of Congress may switch parties, prospective policy changes with momentum on both sides of the aisle might be especially worth keeping an eye on. </p><p>\"One question is can the GOP and Democrats work together at all, on anything, but it could be that privacy is one of those areas,\" McDowell told TheStreet. \"There's certainly been a change in popular opinion since Cambridge Analytica, and people are just more aware that their personal data could be used in ways they don't like. Politicians are seeing those polls, and are looking to modernize or change privacy policy.\"</p><p>In September,  from Apple  , Amazon  , Alphabet  and others on their privacy practices and what an updated federal privacy law might look like. California's  , as well as the  , have helped to raise the prospect of a new national law closer to the surface. And while such a law is likely a long way off, Powell added, it's one that Republicans and Democrats may be able to build consensus on.</p><p>\"Something like that can be sold as pro-consumer or consumer protection might be more of a 2020 item,\" he said. \"There are a lot of ideas out there, and industry is very concerned about the California law -- so maybe there is an incentive to agree on some uniform national revision to privacy laws.\"</p><p>A sense of inevitability around a revised national privacy policy is also common among tech executives, who are already thinking ahead to what it means for companies that deal with significant amounts of data. With cyberattacks and other data breaches a disconcertingly common occurrence, such a revision to privacy laws could also include penalties for companies that fail to appropriately guard consumers' data -- in addition to the resources required for companies to comply with any new laws.</p><p>\"My sense is that new regulations on data in the U.S. are inevitable -- it's a question of when, not if,\" added Andrew Burt, chief privacy officer at Immuta, which builds data management software. \"What's most up in the air is how they'll be implemented, either as a single national standard or as rules that vary by industry, and by regulator.\"</p><p>Congress may also be motivated to give the sheer scale of companies like Facebook and Alphabet a closer look, as complaints about election interference by Democrats and accusations of  persist in the political discourse.</p><p>\"What should be concerning to the tech industry is the bipartisan chatter on Big Tech and some of the largest platforms -- there could be a meeting of the minds,\" McDowell added. \"If you look at the size, power and wealth of these companies against the backdrop of history, never before have you had such powerful companies affecting the daily lives of consumers go so unregulated.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Editor's Pick.
