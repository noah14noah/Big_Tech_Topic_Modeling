Congress Will Investigate</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RACHEL MARTIN:                 How important have Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon become to your daily life? Some in Congress think that these companies have gotten way too big and have way too much power to the point that they are snuffing out competition and actually harming consumers. This comes as the Trump administration has also suggested ramping up its antitrust oversight. Tony Romm with The Washington Post has done extensive reporting on this and is here with us in the studio.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Thanks for coming in.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Hey. Thanks for having me.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So Congress is holding hearings this week on this very topic. What, realistically, is going to come from them?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah. This is about the walls really closing in on big tech companies here in Washington. We've heard lots of theoretical concerns for a long time that companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon are too big and, as a result of that bigness, are misusing your data or stifling competition. But we're now beginning to see lawmakers of both political parties putting that into action.             </p><p>                And what we had this week was an announcement from David Cicilline, the top congressman who leads the House Judiciary Committee's competition focus panel, saying that they're going to embark on this very lengthy, top-to-bottom review of big tech companies to see exactly if they're stifling competition and then to figure out at the end of the line here whether something has to be done to fix the country's antitrust laws. And so we could see a lot here. We could see public hearings. We could see the grilling of major tech executives once again. We could even see subpoenas that force these companies to turn over documents. So it could be pretty uncomfortable for tech.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 I mean, we did see the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testifying in front of Congress last year. I want to play a little clip of that. Let's listen.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 It overlaps with a portion of what we do.             </p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM:                 You don't think you have a monopoly?             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.             </p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM:                 OK.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So Facebook, as you point out, has long been accused of privacy breaches, of spreading disinformation. And Washington kind of just turned a blind eye. Now there is this change. Is this all because of the Russia investigation?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 It feels like they're playing a bit of catch-up here in Washington. It's not all because of the Russia investigation. But I feel - and if you talk to experts, they say the same thing - there's this overwhelming feeling that perhaps Washington just wasn't paying enough attention to the ills of the tech industry, that companies like Facebook had gotten a pretty decent political ride here in Washington.             </p><p>                But whether it's what happened with Russia and the spread of disinformation or the privacy violations we've seen at Facebook, there's now this recognition that perhaps regulation hasn't caught up with these companies. And so this sort of translates into the antitrust conversation with a company like Facebook because lawmakers say, well, if you're concerned with the things that a company like Facebook is doing, where do you turn?             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 What's the other social network that you use if you find that Facebook is acting in some objectionable way? They think the choices are too few.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Right. Because unlike, you know, Apple, which produces the iPhone, there are other alternatives. Something like Facebook, there really isn't something distinct that could provide an alternative for consumers.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah. And Facebook bought up some of its competitors, right? So Facebook also owns WhatsApp, a messaging service. It owns Instagram, which is a photo sharing site that many folks use. And so the concern is that Washington allowed this sort of consolidation to happen and that perhaps there needs to be a second look at a company like Facebook.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So separately, the Trump administration is taking these steps - at least, talking about them - to increase antitrust oversight. How is that going to play out?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah. We're sort of seeing the reckoning translate to the Trump administration as well as the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The two major antitrust agencies here in Washington are beginning to divvy up their territory, deciding which agency is going to look at Facebook or Google or Apple or Amazon. And so it's still early days. This is not to say that there's some immediate antitrust investigation hanging over these companies or that they're going to be broken up or something. But this starts the process that could lead to the sorts of things that change the way these companies behave.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 I mean, Donald Trump and Democratic contender for the White House Elizabeth Warren don't agree on much. But at least they're both talking about the fact that these companies have gotten too large. I mean, she's just calling out for the all-out disassembly of these companies. Facebook's co-founder, Chris Hughes, published an op-ed in The New York Times and talked to us on our show last month calling for Facebook to be broken up. Let's play that.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>CHRIS HUGHES:                 What used to be a little startup, the story of American entrepreneurship, has become a leviathan. And most importantly, Mark Zuckerberg is unaccountable. And I think government should step up, break up the company and regulate it.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Can you foresee that happening?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 We're a long way from that. There is a rare political alignment right now between folks like Warren and President Trump who all feel for slightly different reasons that we need to take a much tougher look at these big tech companies. But a breakup of Facebook or any of its peers, for that matter, is something that wouldn't just happen overnight. I mean, remember, when the U.S. government looked at Microsoft and embarked on an antitrust investigation then, it took over a decade for that to even be resolved. So we're talking about a long process, and the conversation started really this week.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Tony Romm covers technology policy for The Washington Post, and he was in our studios. We should add Facebook, Amazon and Google are all NPR sponsors.             </p><p>                Tony, thank you.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Thanks for having me.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201906041109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-TTG1-DY1J-T1M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

All the conversations, videos, pictures and documents we have shared or have had sent to us are all held on a server somewhere with space specially dedicated to each of us.</p><p>I downloaded the cache (it's very easy to do) to check out everything <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had on file about me from over the years.</p><p>It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must've sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screen shots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform.</p><p>It has facial recognition data (Facebook has 105 examples of what I look like), exhaustive photo metadata including your location and the time the photo was taken and data about every time you logged onto the site such as the IP address, location, browser and device used.</p><p>My file also contained the names and numbers for everyone in my iPhone's contact list - and yours will too.</p><p>It's called surveillance capitalism and it's the reason why <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is worth $92 billion.</p><p>But as the public and regulators become increasingly aware of just how deep Facebook's tentacles extend into our digital lives, the company is facing increasing political headwinds.</p><p>Earlier this month Belgium ordered Facebook to stop tracking internet users who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of 250,000 euros a day. The ruling came amid efforts by the European Union to force Facebook to comply with stringent new privacy rules that would threaten its ability to sell advertising based on targeted user information.</p><p>Now Australia has become the latest government to turn up the heat on the Zuckerbergs of the world.</p><p>The Federal Government has ordered the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the big tech giants in what ACCC chairman Rodd Sims said will be the broadest inquiry of its type in the world.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry will involve asking consumers how much they think the digital platforms know about them and comparing that to what is in fact being gathered.</p><p>\"Some people have asserted that consumers know what's going on and don't care,\" Mr Sims said last week.</p><p>\"I think it's absolutely crucial we find out what consumers do know and then let's see whether they care.

Josh Hawley just two years to make the jump from state attorney general to U.S. senator. After only one year in Washington, there are signs that the Missouri Republican is preparing for another promotion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley has established himself as a national brand within the GOP in ways that could serve as a prelude to a presidential run. He's carved out a niche issue with his push to crack down on the tech industry and begun to articulate a foreign policy vision, which would shift the nation's focus from the Middle East to China. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He's become a fixture of cable news, a sought-after speaker for events hosted by high-profile conservative groups and has repeatedly generated national media attention with legislation that plays to the conservative base. Most recent was his proposal to change the Senate rules to allow for the dismissal of President Donald Trump's impeachment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think he's the future of not just the conservative movement, but the Republican Party. I view him as a Trump 2.0 candidate... someone who can fill Trump's shoes,\" said Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, a Virginia-based social conservative group that gave Hawley an award at its annual gala last year.</p><p>Politico included Hawley in a list of 11 possible contenders for the presidency in 2024, including Vice President Mike Pence, former Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>The Capitol Hill publication compared Hawley to another Midwesterner with an Ivy League pedigree who won the White House as a first-term senator: Barack Obama. </p><p>Hawley, 40, is not eager to embrace the comparison to a Democratic president. But as the youngest member of the Senate he has grabbed Washington's attention by introducing more than 20 bills and resolutions during his first year in office and picking fights with some of the world's largest companies. </p><p>But while Obama's early message centered on hope, Hawley's has focused on despair. </p><p>Hawley warned in a September speech that the nation is witnessing a \"slow-motion collapse of the working class,\" that is leading to \"deaths of despair.\" It was striking rhetoric at a time when Republicans, who control both Jefferson City and the White House, want to celebrate economic victories. </p><p>While some in the GOP see Hawley as the future, detractors describe him as an overambitious nuisance who disregards the party's traditional commitment to free market values -- and a phony for inveighing against the \"cosmopolitan elite\" after an education at Stanford and Yale Law School, followed by a clerkship for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.</p><p>The willingness to pick fights with business interests evokes Hawley's boyhood hero, the trust-busting Republican President Teddy Roosevelt. But it's also made him a figure of scorn for The Wall Street Journal's editorial page and libertarian-leaning groups, who wielded major influence over GOP politics in the pre-Trump era. </p><p>Hawley said he's just doing his job.</p><p>\"I thought it was one of the funny things about this building that we started introducing all of this legislation and doing things I said I was going to do and people immediately said, oh, you must want a different job,\" he said. </p><p>\"And I was like, I'm just doing my job. I'm not looking for any other job. I want to do this job and there's a lot to do.\" </p><p>In his 2016 campaign for attorney general, Hawley assured voters he was not a ladder-climbing politician. But just weeks into his tenure he brought in political consultants who would go on to run his successful U.S. Senate campaign and help direct his government office. </p><p>After The Star revealed the arrangement, Hawley faced accusations from Democrats that he illegally used state resources to support the campaign, which Hawley vehemently denied. Democratic State Auditor Nicole Galloway has spent the last year conducting a routine close-out audit of Hawley's attorney general's office that would also probe the various allegations.</p><p>Hawley said last week that he's seen a draft of the audit, claiming on social media and in fundraising letters that it exonerates him. Galloway's spokeswoman said the auditor can't comment until it is made public, which will be in \"the coming weeks.\"</p><p>The early speculation about 2024 threatens to revive the narrative about Hawley using his current office as a stepping stone. But even as he downplays his interest in a presidential run, political allies have repeatedly pushed the idea that he represents the future of the Republican Party.</p><p>Gregg Keller, a St. Louis-based Republican strategist, hailed Hawley as a conservative thought leader and \"someone who's a true populist but looks like a J. Crew model at the same time.\"</p><p>\"I think you would be hard pressed to find a senator outside of leadership who has been more impactful in the last year than Josh Hawley and that's pretty incredible for a freshman,\" he said. </p><p>Jeff Smith, a former Democratic Missouri state senator, said Hawley \"is betting that he can adapt Trump-ism by grafting an intellectual veneer onto it and drawing heavily upon his Lexington, Mo., roots to personalize Trump-style populism,\" but he questioned whether this political brand would remain appealing in 2024. </p><p>Hawley's focus</p><p>Hawley's outspoken approach contrasts sharply with Missouri's other Republican senator, Roy Blunt, a mild-mannered pragmatist who has been on Capitol Hill since 1997. </p><p>A Missouri Republican strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly, said Blunt has taken on the heavy lifting of Missouri constituent case work and coordination with local governments while Hawley has developed his national and international focus. </p><p>\"It's a little unusual that it's a freshman and a long-tenured senator. Typically the roles are reversed,\" the strategist said. \"If you want a passport, you better call Blunt's office. Hawley's office is not going to be helpful. If you are looking for someone to focus on fighting big tech, he's probably your guy.\"</p><p>For his part, Blunt praised Hawley for taking on \"complicated issues that others haven't been willing to engage in at the level he has.\" He said the two quickly arrived at understanding that they would not always agree on every issue.</p><p>\"But that hasn't affected us having a very positive working relationship,\" Blunt said last month. \"As my wife would say, if you both agreed all the time, one of you wouldn't be necessary.\"</p><p>Hawley's critics, however, have found his public persona hollow and question his priorities as a senator.</p><p>\"I see him spend a lot of his time trying to curry the favor of cable TV hosts. It'd be nice if the senator was instead actually working for Missouri... I can't point to anything that's come out of what he's been working on in the last year, aside from a few cable news clips,\" said Sean Nicholson, a long-time progressive strategist in Missouri. </p><p>Rep. William Lacy Clay, the Democrat who represents St. Louis, said Hawley's focus on China and the tech industry appears divorced from the most pressing issues facing Missourians. </p><p>\"We have not really found an issue where we can work on in a bipartisan way on behalf of our mutual constituents, which is somewhat disappointing to me,\" Lacy Clay said. \"Those issues that you mention I don't hear much about from my constituents, but I wish he could be a little more focused on the ones that really matter.\" </p><p>Hawley and his supporters say the senator has remained focused on Missouri even while tackling national issues, including his push to give farmers a greater say over management of the Missouri River after last year's flooding. </p><p>Last August, Hawley took a tour through southeast Missouri to focus on communities he said had been forgotten by policymakers and the media. </p><p>Mark Pickard, a teacher and pastor in Malden who met Hawley during this tour, said he was impressed by his discussions at a local barber shop.</p><p>\"He spent quite a bit of time talking with people, listening to their problems and spent a lot of time.... Three guys who were there were convicted felons who he sat and had conversations with about their trials and the struggles they've had to deal with getting their life back on track,\" Pickard said. </p><p>\"Didn't feel like a publicity stunt. He was really trying to figure out their problems and what he could do to help.\" </p><p>James Harris, a veteran GOP political consultant who called himself the \"self-appointed chairman of the Jefferson City Josh Hawley fan club,\" praised the senator for his tour of rural Missouri for spending \"a lot of time with people who probably have never met a United States Senator. </p><p>\"When they meet him,\" Harris said, \"his constituents feel like they have a direct connection with him.\"</p><p>Shortly after the tour, Hawley took to the Senate floor to discuss a Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services report on declining life expectancy in the state. </p><p>Drawing on the bleak data about suicides and overdose deaths, Hawley held the nation's economic and political systems accountable for the misery in Missouri towns with shuttered businesses and an overflow of fentanyl. </p><p>\"It is time for the governing class to admit that the policies it has pursued for decades-- on trade, on immigration, on finance-- have helped drive working people to this crisis. And it's time to acknowledge that a crisis for working America is a crisis for all of America,\" Hawley said. \"It's not enough for wealthy people in Silicon Valley to do well.\"</p><p>Fights with Silicon Valley</p><p>Hawley, who attended college at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, the center of Silicon Valley, has established himself as Capitol Hill's go-to critic of the tech industry. </p><p>Some of his legislation, including a measure that would require audits for political bias at social media companies, has been dismissed as pure messaging meant to stir up his conservative base. </p><p>But other initiatives, like a push for consumer control of data and increased privacy protections for children online, have support from Democrats. </p><p>\"With such broad support here in the building and with such public support, why don't we start with protecting children's privacy? Why don't we start with giving everybody a right of control over their data? Those are pretty easy scores, so let's do that,\" Hawley said when asked about the prospect of passing the legislation this year after it stalled in 2019. </p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg was \"not receptive\" to Hawley's suggestions during Capitol Hill meetingMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley discusses his meeting with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Missouri Republican said he told Zuckerberg that Facebook should sell off Instagram and WhatsApp to demonstrate its commitment to data privacy.</p><p>His approach to tech has sparked conflict between Hawley and the libertarian wing of the conservative movement, which favors loose regulation for businesses. </p><p>When the Southeast Missourian published an opinion piece last month touting Hawley's \"new conservative approach to governing,\" Jeremy Cady, the Missouri director of Americans For Prosperity, replied in a now-deleted tweet, \"Couldn't 'New Conservative' also be referred to as... 'Progressive'?\" </p><p>Cady elaborated on the policy disputes between Hawley and AFP, an organization which spent more than $3.9 million on ads in 2018 promoting him and attacking his Democratic opponent, then-Sen. Claire McCaskill. </p><p>\"He said technology is a source of peril, and that's something we would disagree with,\" Cady said. </p><p>\"Technology as a whole has done a lot for our community, society, country and as a people. We can't just look at tech and social media as evil. There are absolutely issues and stuff we must make better. But is the government the answer for fixing that?\" </p><p>Hawley said when he develops legislation he's not thinking about whether it fits a traditional definition of conservatism.</p><p>\"When we think about putting forward these proposals, whether it's tech, whether it's stuff on the Army Corps, whether it's our health care prescription drug proposals, my first thought is what's actually going to be responsive to the concerns of people who elected me. I don't really think in terms of what fits in this box or that box, or this label or that label,\" Hawley said. </p><p>\"The president won Missouri by 20 points. I think that he is clearly offering an agenda that Missourians warm to and agree with and I think it's because people listen to him and said, he's actually interested in getting stuff done that matters to me and my family.

Josh Hawley's dangerous assault on the First Amendment has escalated. Missourians who value free speech and free thought must make their views known, quickly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under current law, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter -- or the blogger down the street -- can't be held legally responsible for most of the digital content that users post on their sites. The law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has helped the internet flourish as a place for free debate and discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley isn't interested in any of that, it appears. He's proposed a bill to revoke Section 230 protections for any big digital company that fails a government review of its practices and decisions.</p><p>\"Tech companies get a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability, in exchange for providing a forum free of political censorship,\" Hawley said in a statement. </p><p>He's simply wrong. Section 230 does not say protected companies must provide viewpoint-neutral public forums. Nor could it: The First Amendment protects citizens from being forced to repeat things with which they disagree.</p><p>\"The Free Speech Clause prohibits ... governmental abridgment of speech,\" the Supreme Court said just this week. \"The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit private abridgment of speech.\"</p><p>There are other concerns. Under Hawley's bill, big tech firms would have to show the Federal Trade Commission \"clear and convincing evidence\" that they have not discriminated against political parties, candidates and viewpoints. It isn't clear, though, how the FTC would decide what discrimination looks like.</p><p>\"It's dangerous to give a government agency the impossible task of enforcing political neutrality on platforms,\" said a statement from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital free speech advocacy group.</p><p>Critics said Wednesday the bill might force tech companies to take down all political speech, for fear of offending the government -- or leave everything online, including hateful, bigoted speech and images. Both approaches are wrong-headed and scary. </p><p>The Hawley measure is such a threat to free speech and free thought that both conservative and liberal groups are condemning it. </p><p>\"Sen. Hawley's misguided legislation sets the table for stricter government control over free expression online,\" the conservative group Americans for Prosperity said of the Republican senator's bill. The government, the group said, would have the ability \"to police your speech and determine what you can or cannot say.\"</p><p>It's clear Missouri's senator wants to make regulation of big technology companies a top priority. Yes, Facebook, Google and Twitter may be too big, and government oversight of their business models, including anti-trust enforcement, may be needed.</p><p>But arguing over the firms' free speech rights, or holding them hostage, is a counterproductive distraction from that effort.</p><p>Sadly, this isn't the first time Hawley has waged war on the Constitution. Just a few weeks ago, he opposed a federal judge nominee on faith and speech grounds, establishing a religious test for judicial confirmation. That, too, is offensive. </p><p>\"A shortsighted faction on the right has unwittingly argued itself into a scorched-earth litmus test unrelated to judicial philosophy,\" a columnist wrote in the Federalist.</p><p>Let us state plainly what Hawley does not understand: The First Amendment protects the right to speak and worship as one pleases. It prohibits the government from interfering with those rights. </p><p>Missourians and all Americans who respect those rights, should tell Sen. Hawley. His phone number is 202-224-6154.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KCSTAR-cef2b7ba0b5940818b69077b10d20b0f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KCSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCM-RHV1-JC3J-X0F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Kansas City Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Kansas City Star</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11093\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(AP) - Sen. Josh Hawley on Tuesday introduced legislation that would give internet users the ability to opt out of allowing their personal data to be tracked and collected, the latest effort in the Missouri Republican's broader campaign against big tech.</p><p>Hawley's Do Not Track Act is modeled after the national Do Not Call list, which allows people to opt out of telemarketing calls.</p><p>Hawley's office says it would allow internet users to opt out of tracking by clicking a setting in their browsers or by downloading an app. Hawley said the measure is in response to big tech companies collecting \"incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent.\"</p><p>\"They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"The American people didn't sign up for this, so I'm introducing this legislation to finally give them control over their personal information online.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would have the authority to enforce the legislation, and the bill would give the FTC the power to create related regulations.</p><p>Companies would face a minimum $100,000 fine or up to $1,000 per day per affected person for knowingly violating the rules. Negligent violations could be punished by as much as $50 per day per affected person.</p><p>The bill includes an exception for data collected to help law enforcement.</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center President Marc Rotenberg said voluntary opt-outs for internet tracking and data collection have not worked. He said enforcement is crucially important.</p><p>\"The companies can ignore voluntary participation, and oftentimes it's the biggest offenders who will,\" Rotenberg said. \"That's why I think legislation is necessary.\"</p><p>Rotenberg, who said the nonprofit center worked on the original Do Not Call legislation, cautioned that an opt-out program for internet tracking will be more challenging. He said while telephone numbers can easily be added to the do-not-call list, an internet program needs to cover email addresses and potential IP addresses.</p><p>The Internet Association, which counts Google, Facebook and Amazon among its members, did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. The Association of National Advertisers didn't immediately comment.</p><p>As Missouri attorney general, Hawley launched an investigation of Google for potential violations of the state's consumer-protection and antitrust laws and demanded information from Facebook following allegations that the social media giant mishandled user data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-c9f14787c25f48dda7455438ef4a8963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5G-7PM1-JC65-51MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><timeReceived>8:54 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, is one of the most outspoken anti-Big Tech Republicans in Congress, repeatedly raising questions about whether Big Tech's influence is good for society or whether the biggest companies engage in anticompetitive behaviors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But conservatives and liberals alike say Hawley's new bill rolling back some protections for tech companies is \"absurd,\" \"bad,\" \"unconstitutional,\" and a slippery slope into government control and censorship of all speech on the internet.</p><p>Hawley's bill, the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, would chip away at Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act (CDA), which offers tech platforms (like Facebook and Google) legal immunity from what their users post. According to Hawley's new bill, if tech companies do not moderate their content in a \"politically neutral\" way, they will not receive legal immunity from what their users post.</p><p>(Hawley says this will force tech companies not to censor conservatives, even though other more conservative Republican senators like Ted Cruz have said there is only \"anecdotal evidence\" that tech companies censor conservatives. According to research and data compiled by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, tech companies censor individuals on both ends of the political spectrum, far right and far left, intentionally or unintentionally.)</p><p>The bill's definition of \"politically neutral,\" according to both conservatives and liberals, is impossibly vague, opening it up to interpretation by whichever political party is in control.</p><p>Hawley describes Section 230 as a \"sweetheart deal\" for Big Tech, allowing them to blur the line between acting as a platform (a place where others can post or upload content) and a publisher (someone who prepares, curates and distributes content for consumption).</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who wrote the CDA, tweeted on Wednesday that Hawley's bill essentially enables government control of speech.</p><p>\"[It] will turn the federal government into Speech Police, flagrantly violating the First Amendment,\" he tweeted. \"This bill would force every platform to become 4chan or 8chan rather than maintain some basic level of decency.\"</p><p>According to Wyden, all tech companies are liable for making posts that violate federal criminal law, so to him, Hawley's bill doesn't even make sense.</p><p>\"CDA 230 lets private companies take down inappropriate third-party posts without incurring liability,\" Wyden said. \"It's designed to protect companies from floods of lawsuits, the sort that kill innovation in its infancy. Republicans used to fight tooth and nail for these protections. But these days, Trump's Republican Party seems to believe that lawyers and bureaucrats should tell private companies how to make clearly private business decisions. The drive by Republicans to eliminate the autonomy of large private firms is extremely disturbing.\"</p><p>David French, a conservative commentator from National Review, called the bill \"unwise\" and \"unconstitutional,\" and said it \"would enable public censorship in the name of limiting private control.\"</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, called Hawley's bill \"disingenuous\" and said he entirely missed the root problem with Big Tech.</p><p>\"This is one of the fundamental questions of our era, is how do we treat [tech] platforms?\" Sinnreich told InsideSources. \"There is no ideal fix, and this is part of the reason why it's so dangerous they have become so consolidated. [Hawley is] exploiting uncertainty in the regulatory community to sneak in a form of government overreach in controlling private speech by fiat.\"</p><p>The irony, Sinnreich said, is that Hawley -- a self-described conservative -- advocates for very anti-conservative principles with his bill.</p><p>\"There's nothing more Big Government than telling private companies they have to amplify certain messages,\" Sinnreich said. \"It's totally hypocritical and irrational and blatantly political. He should know better. He does know better,\" he added, referencing Hawley's career as a constitutional lawyer.</p><p>Hawley's bill mimics the Federal Communications Commission's 1949 Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to present both sides of any issue in a way the FCC considered fair and balanced.</p><p>Under President Ronald Reagan's leadership in 1987, the FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine, calling it an \"intrusion of government\" that \"restricts journalistic freedom\" and \"actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public.\"</p><p>Sinnreich also noted that as the poles of the political spectrum move farther to the right and to the left, it becomes increasingly difficult to decide what is \"politically neutral.\"</p><p>\"Neutrality is in the eye of the beholder,\" he said. \"It's part of this larger agenda to mainstream racist rhetoric that has become ascendant in the American right-wing recently. You can find historic impetus for this, like in Europe in the 1930s.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

That would make them utterly dependent upon the goodwill of FTC Commissioners, and in turn, the White House. Any two Commissioners could block recertification. While the original Fairness Doctrine clearly skewed broadcast programming, actual showdowns were exceedingly rare: licenses were almost never canceled, broadcasters could rely on an expectation of renewal of their licenses every eight years, and the FCC at least tried to hide its partisan agenda. Hawley's bill would set up a partisan bloodmatch every other year, with the FTC having to take a public vote on each social network's political 'neutrality,' and companies having to prove themselves innocent each time. In short, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the bill would give politicians a gigantic regulatory hammer to use against Big Tech</emphasis> - and transform the FTC overnight into the most politicized regulatory body in Washington. Sadly, that seems to be the point.\"<br/>In\u00a0testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last year at a hearing on anti-conservative bias, Sz\u00f3ka explained in detail the parallels between the Fairness Doctrine and proposals to amend Section 230 to require political neutrality.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Hawley claims that Section 230 is some kind of subsidy for Big Tech, but this just isn't true,\" </emphasis>continued Sz\u00f3ka. \"Given the staggering scale and breathtaking speed at which users post content online, there's just no way for social networks to vet content the way newspapers vet letters to the editor. This makes Section 230's shield against liability for user-generated content as essential to social networks as a broadcast license was for broadcasters. Ironically, Hawley's approach essentially concedes the vital importance of Section 230: rather than proposing to tweak how the statute works, he proposes simply to tie its indispensable protections to a government-issued certification of political neutrality.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Hawley's bill would profoundly politicize how social media sites work,\"</emphasis> concluded Sz\u00f3ka. \"Second-guessing how broadcasters filled scarce airtime created a bland orthodoxy that excluded conservative views. Online, the problem isn't what views fill scarce airtime, but the opposite: how to deal with an endless explosion of content and tendency of the loudest, nastiest views to dominate online forums. Content moderation is what makes social networks usable for normal people, yet Hawley's bill would make social networks hesitate from combating misinformation and various forms of online abuse - lest they offend some politician. And if, as social science research suggests, such harmful content seems to help Republicans energize their base more than it helps Democrats, even truly 'neutral' enforcement of terms of service will, on net, hurt the Right. That which would explain why Republicans insist on framing content moderation as 'censorship' of their views.\"<br/>* * *<br/>We can be reached for comment at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@techfreedom.org\">media@techfreedom.org</email> See more of our work on free speech and Section 230 on our website, including:<br/>Our op-ed \"Some conservatives need a First Amendment refresher\"<br/>Our letter to AG Session \"DOJ Inquiry re Tech Companies Bias is Misguided\"<br/>Our blogpost \"Reality Check for Trump and Republicans Crying 'Bias'\"!<br/>President Berin Sz\u00f3ka's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on the filtering practices of social media platforms<br/>Our statement on the passage of SESTA<br/>Our statement on the takedown of Backpage and its implications for Section 230 and recent sex trafficking legislation<br/>Tech Policy Podcast #226: The Fairness Doctrine: Next Generation<br/>Tech Policy Podcast #214: Information Intermediaries in a Nutshell<br/>The post Hawley Proposes a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet appeared first on TechFreedom.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-66260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG2-55C1-F03R-W00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Techfreedom, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techfreedom</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Section 230</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Josh Hawley said recently that the engineers and scientists who created the social media universe have provided questionable value to American culture and society, and that they are essentially capitalizing on the addictions of their consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking at an event sponsored by the Hoover Institution, a think tank affiliated with his Stanford University alma mater, Hawley declared that \"we have encouraged an entire generation of our bright engineers\" to work in \"a discipline that provides little or no productive value to the United States economy.\"</p><p>The Missouri Republican said Silicon Valley is taking the best and brightest \"from communities that need their talents, out to outposts on the coasts, encouraging them to forget the problems of the people that they left behind. And, of course, capital follows them to those places.\"</p><p>Hawley added: \"I think the evidence is more and more strongly suggesting that there is something that is deeply troubling, maybe even deeply wrong, with the entire social media economy; that it does not represent a source of strength for America's tomorrow, but is rather a source of peril.\"</p><p>His remarks also came at a time social media giants are taking steps to head off tougher government regulations and anti-trust oversight. The day after Hawley spoke at the Hoover event, Facebook announced it had banned the National of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as \"dangerous individuals,\" along with a handful of right-wing figures who had developed followings on social media.</p><p>Conservatives, including Hawley and President Donald Trump, have attacked big social media platforms for what they say is a bias in how they police content on their sites.</p><p>In many appearances before Congress over the last several years, executives for Google, Twitter and others broadly denied bias while publicly acknowledging mistakes in how they have walked the line between free expression and offensive or hateful speech.</p><p>In the 20-minute Hoover speech, Hawley again raised the possibility of changing or repealing a 23-year-old provision of the Communications Decency Act that gives broad exemption for online hosts for others' content posted on it.</p><p>That provision, in Section 230 of the act, was a major debate point last year in anti-sex trafficking provisions pushed into law by Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, and others.</p><p>Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for the e-commerce trade association NetChoice, was in the Hoover audience. In a question, he tried to reinforce Hawley's acknowledgement that \"we should be doing this through market reinforcement\" rather than government intervention.</p><p>Szabo, whose organization represents a veritable alphabet of big tech companies, said that Hawley \"is too dismissive of the widespread benefits of social media.</p><p>\"Never before in the history of the world have so many people had access to so much information,\" he said. \"No longer is our access to news about (the) world dictated by a small number of news outlets.</p><p>\"Social media is not destroying democracy, as Sen. Hawley suggests,\" Szabo added. \"Rather, social media connects us to our government like never before.\"</p><p>In a short question-and-answer session following his speech, Hawley was confronted by a college professor at the University of Virginia and at a Chinese university. She questioned Hawley's assertions that social media had attracted the best brains while producing little good.</p><p>She called Silicon Valley \"one of our most important national security advantages\" and told Hawley that \"all of my best students want to go to Silicon Valley, even those in Beijing.\"</p><p>\"Let me just be on record saying I don't believe in this Silicon Valley worship that says that it is unquestionably the very best of American society,\" Hawley responded.</p><p>\"We need to question whether they are actually giving us the best, and whether the investment of their time and talent - whether it is really being put towards truly socially and economically productive use. I do question that.\"</p><p>Hawley saved his toughest language for how he described social media's business model and how big tech is working with China and other potential foes.</p><p>Social media companies earn off \"attention arbitrage,\" Hawley said, where \"users' attention is bought by the tech giants and immediately sold to advertisers, for the highest price of course.\"</p><p>That attention, he said, \"is preserved by hijacking users' neurocircuitry to prevent rational decision-making about what to click and how to spend time.</p><p>\"It is preserved through addiction,\" he said, adding that shareholders of social media companies \"are investing in the addiction of users.\"</p><p>He accused big tech companies of working with a \"repressive Chinese government\" that could produce \"an authoritative state to the likes that this world has never seen before.</p><p>\"Forget surveillance capitalism,\" Hawley said. \"Surveillance communism is truly, truly startling - I think to a degree that most Americans have no idea.\"</p><p>But, Szabo responded, \"Social media, like any tool, can be used for good and ill.</p><p>\"Knee-jerk reactions to perceived problems could harm small businesses and our ability to connect with friends and family,\" the NetChoice executive said.</p><p>Hawley has introduced legislation restricting what data social media companies can collect on children and giving parents greater ability to erase children's online content.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Hawley serves, has begun hearings probing social media. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, which has also ramped up investigations of social media.</p><p>\"I've got a 14-year-old son, so I don't think it has had very positive impacts on kids growing up,\" Blunt said. \"But there is a lot of information available to them that we didn't have a few years ago.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Sen.

His testimony came at a time of measured caution among lawmakers and members of the Trump administration -- and recent scandals involving the social media giant.</p><p>Ohio Sen.  compared Facebook to a toddler playing with matches. Allowing Facebook to launch a decentralized digital currency, he said, is a bad idea.</p><p>\"Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience,\" he said.</p><p>Some lawmakers have already drafted plans to block the Libra in the United States. Beyond regulatory concerns, they're concerned the system could be misused by terrorists and money launderers. Marcus emphasized at Tuesday's meeting the entire system will be fully vetted before launch.</p><p>\"If America doesn't lead innovation in digital currency and payments area, others will,\" he told the panel.</p><p>Facebook said it plans to embed a Libra \"wallet\" into its Messenger and Whatsapp and will block other competing wallets, like 's. Libra will be headquartered in Switzerland despite being regulated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Facebook has said it won't use any personal data from the digital wallet, an issue Facebook has already taken substantial criticism for.</p><p>Facebook says the Libra will allow users to send money around the world for free with the same ease as sending a text message or a photo. It will immediately challenge other blockchain systems like standard-bearer bitcoin.</p><p>Marcus said Libra is backed on a one-to-one basis through cash bank deposits, short term government securities and hard currencies, including the U.S. dollar, British pound, euro and Japanese yen. A number of companies have already backed the Libra, including MasterCard, Uber, PayPal and eBay.</p><p>\"[] Chairman [Jerome] Powell has made clear that the process for reviewing Libra needs to be patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation. We strongly agree,\" he said. \"We know we need to take the time to get this right.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary  said Monday President  has concerns about how cryptocurrencies can be misused by \"money launderers and terrorist financiers,\" noting Facebook has \"a lot of work to do.\"</p><p>\"Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking,\" he said.</p><p>In the House, financial services committee chair  wants Facebook to suspend Libra's release until lawmakers first consider a bill that would bar social media and tech companies from setting up their own financial systems. Titled the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,\" the ban would apply to any company with at least $25 billion in annual revenue -- which also offers a web-based marketplace, exchange or platform for \"connecting third parties.\"</p><p>Marcus will answer questions from Waters' committee Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UPI-5401563236473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UPI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKD-KVF1-DY83-T0CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8076</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><timeReceived>6:49 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 U.P.I.

Not surprisingly, the tech giants\u2019 chief executives told Congress: absolutely not. The concern that too much power is concentrated in too few companies is unfounded, they said Wednesday.    Does Apple punish its rivals on the App Store to score more customers?    Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia drew attention to Apple\u2019s Screen Time app, a service allowing parents to limit their kids\u2019 phone use.    When Apple introduced the app in 2018, competing parental control apps, such as OurPact, were booted from the App Store for not meeting Apple\u2019s safety requirements.    Apple CEO Tim Cook told McBath those fears were justified.    \u201cWe were concerned, Congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\u201d Cook said, noting the app was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \u201cSo we were worried about their safety.\u201d    But McBath said House investigators discovered that rival parental control apps that were kicked out of the App Store were readmitted six months later without making significant privacy overhauls.    \u201cOf course, six months is truly an eternity for small businesses to be shut down, even worse if all the while a larger competitor is actually taking away customers,\u201d she said.    McBath pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple\u2019s Screen Time.    Cook said \u201cthere are many reasons why\u201d an app may not meet the App Store\u2019s guidelines, dismissing the suggestion that Apple squashed its competition to favor its own service.    McBath referenced a second example involving the publisher Random House, which says Apple held back the introduction of its app as Apple pushed its own similar product.    \u201cEven some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\u201d McBath said. \u201cThis is fundamentally unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that\u2019s a great concern to all of us.\u201d    \u2014 Bobby Allyn    CEO vows Google won\u2019t play favorites in 2020 election    Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced a barrage of questions from Rep. Jim Jordan. The Ohio Republican said he\u2019s concerned that Google will tailor its search engine to give a leg up to presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden over President Trump in searches related to the November election.    When Jordan asked Pichai for a promise to Americans that Google will not favor Biden in the 2020 election, Pichai said \u201cwe don\u2019t do any work to politically tilt anything one way or another.\u201d    Jordan persisted with the same question.    Pichai, eventually, agreed to make a commitment that Google will not tilt its features to help Biden and that the search engine will not be used to silence conservatives.    \u201cYeah, you have my commitment. It\u2019s always been true and we\u2019ll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way,\u201d Pichai said.    It\u2019s a line of inquiry that is far afield from the purpose of the hearing, noted Pennsylvania Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon, saying she\u2019d like to turn the focus back to antitrust, rather than \u201cfringe conspiracy theories.\u201d    This incited Jordan, who interrupted Scanlon, launching a screaming match between Jordan and Democratic leadership about following the rules of the hearing.    \u201cWhen someone comes after my motives for asking questions,\u201d shouted Jordan, \u201cI should get a chance to respond.\u201d    \u2014 Bobby Allyn    Does Amazon use sellers\u2019 data to help itself?    The first inquiry for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos finally arrived from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., some two hours into the hearing. Jayapal zeroed in on the subcommittee\u2019s central concern about Amazon: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \u201cI can\u2019t answer that questions yes or no,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cWe have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d    Committee lawmakers have previously accused Amazon of \u201c lack of candor \u201d about how it might be using other sellers\u2019 data to give an edge its own business, something Amazon executives have, until now, denied was happening.    Critics have made the case that Amazon employees may have used such data to create the retailer\u2019s own private-label products, which Bezos told lawmakers the company was still investigating.    Jayapal noted that Amazon has access to information about consumer habits, sellers\u2019 pricing and inventory data, a trove of details that could be ripe for abuse if used to make business decisions about Amazon\u2019s own products.    \u201cYou can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\u201d Jayapal said.    \u201cYou have access to data that your competitors do not have,\u201d she continued, adding that if Amazon was \u201ccontinuously monitoring\u201d such data to make sure that other sellers \u201care never going to get big enough that they can compete with you \u2014 that is actually the concern that the committee has,\u201d she said.    \u2013Alina Selyukh    Google\u2019s Pichai is pressed on being \u201cthe gateway to the Internet\u201d    Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline spent all of his first 5-minute block of questions on Google \u2014 the company at most immediate risk of actual antitrust action. The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to sue the company over its advertising business, and could be joined by state attorneys general who have also been investigating Google.    Cicilline pressed CEO Sundar Pichai on whether Google\u2019s business model presents a conflict of interest, because it has an incentive to give search results that keep users on its own site rather than anywhere else on the Internet.    \u201cAs Google became the gateway to the Internet, it began to abuse its power,\u201d Cicilline said.    Pichai responded that Google \u201calways focuses on providing users the most relevant information.\u201d Cicilline appeared annoyed at Pichai\u2019s answers, cutting him off several times to move to another question.    \u2013Shannon Bond    Still waiting for questions for Jeff Bezos    Over an hour-and-a-half into the hearing, Jeff Bezos \u2014 appearing in Congress for the first time, whose company employs a million workers and has over 150 million paying subscribers \u2014 has yet to receive a single question.    His presence was slated to become a powerful accomplishment of the House Judiciary Committee, but the questioning so far has left him muted on the live video feed, reaching for some snacks.    The hearing, meanwhile, is taking a 10-minute break to fix a technical problem \u201cwith one of our witnesses.\u201d    \u2013Alina Selyukh    Did Facebook buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor?    Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg on exactly why his company bought Instagram for $1 billion back in 2012. That\u2019s a key part of competition questions facing the social media giant. Critics accuse Facebook of buying or copying rivals \u2014 like Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 to squash competition.    Nadler said in its investigation, the committee got documents from Facebook in which Zuckerberg discussed \u201cneutralizing a competitor\u201d as a reason to pursue Instagram.    \u201cFacebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook. And so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it,\u201d Nadler said.    Zuckerberg points out that the Federal Trade Commission okayed the merger at the time. \u201cWith hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\u201d he said.    Cicilline interjected to say that the \u201cfailures\u201d of the FTC in 2012 do not mean it was not a violation of antitrust law.    \u2013Shannon Bond    Panel chairman: Under coronavirus, big tech \u201clikely to emerge stronger and more powerful\u201d    Up first is Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee that\u2019s holding this hearing. He is the driving force behind the year-long investigation of big tech.    In his opening remarks , he describes the dominance of each company: Amazon in online shopping, Apple in smartphones and apps, Facebook in social media and Google in search and ads. And he points out that thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, all four \u201care likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.\u201d    \u201cAs American families shift more of their work, shopping, and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned businesses, meanwhile \u2014mom and pop stores on Main Street \u2014 face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history,\u201d Cicilline said.    The committee\u2019s investigation has turned up a pattern among the tech giants, he said. They control access to information and marketplaces, use that control to \u201csurveil\u201d rivals and protect their power, and favor their own businesses.    \u201cSimply put: They have too much power,\u201d Cicilline said. For consumers, he said, this is reminiscent of previous American monopolies: railroads, oil and telephone companies, and even another tech giant \u2014 Microsoft.    \u201cThis investigation also goes to the heart of whether we, as a people, govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies,\u201d he said. \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d    \u2013Shannon Bond    Republican Jim Jordan: \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives\u201d    Wednesday\u2019s hearing is supposed to be about Big Tech\u2019s power and market dominance. But Republicans are already trying to make it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his fiery opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.    He also mentioned Twitter, even though it is not part of the hearing. Jordan said conservative members of Congress were \u201cshadow banned\u201d on Twitter. He said Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey said it was a glitch.    \u201cIf I had a nickel for every time I heard it was just a glitch, I wouldn\u2019t be as wealthy as our witnesses, but I\u2019d be doing right,\u201d Jordan said.    \u201cWe all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what\u2019s not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact election,\u201d Jordan said. \u201c\u201dIf it doesn\u2019t end, there has to be consequences.\u201d    Before Jordan\u2019s remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief, strongly contested by large tech companies, that conservatives do not get a fair shake by the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship troubling.    \u201cConservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\u201d Sensenbrenner said.    The hearing erupted in chaos after Jordan asked that Rep. Mike Johnson of the House Judiciary\u2019s Constitution subcommittee be allowed to participate in the hearing. The request was denied.    Jordan then repeatedly interrupted antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, who was attempting to introduce Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.    \u201cWe\u2019re talking about peoples\u2019 liberties here,\u201d Jordan said over Cicilline.    \u201cPut your mask on,\u201d Jordan was told.    \u2013Bobby Allyn    Trump tweets: \u2018Bring fairness to Big Tech\u2019    The hearing has gotten underway, after an hour-long delay. First up, we will get opening statements from the top members of the committee and the four CEOs. Then lawmakers will each get five minutes to question Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg. All four will be joining remotely, via video.    The focus of the hearing, and the committee\u2019s investigation, is competition \u2014 but expect lawmakers to be unable to resist bringing up other complaints about tech companies, from election security and the spread of misinformation to alleged anti-conservative bias.    That\u2019s also the message coming from the White House, where President Trump has repeatedly accused tech companies of treating him unfairly. Shortly after noon, he tweeted : \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\u201d    \u2013Shannon Bond    Our original story by Bobby Allyn continues:    Amid a time of rising tensions with China, some of the powerful CEOs will suggest that too much regulation could provide an opportunity for Chinese tech firms to gain a global toehold, according to opening remarks from the tech leaders released by the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.    \u201cWe believe in values \u2014 democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression  \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg will tell lawmakers, according to his prepared opening statement . \u201cChina is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.\u201d    Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person who will be making his first-ever appearance in front of Congress, will bring in his personal story of being adopted by an immigrant father when he was 4 years old and spending his summers on his grandparents\u2019 ranch in Texas, saying his upbringing instilled in him a work ethic that has helped Amazon prosper.    Amazon\u2019s rise to becoming the largest online retailer, Bezos will say, is an achievement only made possible in America. But Walmart, he will point out, is still twice the size of Amazon.    \u201cWe did not start out as the largest marketplace \u2014 eBay was many times our size. It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay,\u201d Bezos says in his released testimony .    Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai will steer attention to the other ways people navigate the online world, even though 90% of Internet searches happen on Google.    \u201cPeople have more ways to search for information than ever before \u2014 and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine,\u201d Pichai plans to tell the House panel. \u201cYou can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest.\u201d    Apple\u2019s Tim Cook will echo the appeals to patriotism raised among the other tech CEOs by touting how Apple\u2019s strength, becoming the most valuable company in the world, represents success \u201conly possible in this country.\u201d    He will also join the other tech leaders by arguing that Apple has plenty of competition.    \u201cThe smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches,\u201d Cook will say in his opening statement to lawmakers.    Whether members of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee buy these arguments over the course of what is set to be an hourslong spectacle is another matter.    And it remains to be seen if the public will gain new insight into the tech companies, and whether lawmakers can pin down answers from the typically cautious technology executives.    The CEOs will be testifying via video at the same time, rather than one by one, a format seen as taking the heat off any individual executive and something the companies requested.    While the hearing centers on questions around market dominance, lawmakers are free to pepper the executives with questions about any topic.    The anything-goes format will likely divert the hearing away from antitrust and delve into issues like perceived anti-conservative bias on social media platforms, a common Republican refrain. And Democrats, often raising concern about foreign election meddling, may inquire about possible efforts to influence the vote online ahead of the November election.    More on-topic probing could involve issues like acquisitions that have grown the reach of Big Tech.    For instance, Facebook has acquired nearly 90 companies, including Instagram,  WhatsApp and more recently, Giphy, a tool for creating animated images.    How ever it goes, one thing is certain: It will be a day for the history books.    The hearing is the first time all four technology leaders have testified together, as scrutiny over the companies\u2019 nearly $5 trillion market power draws intensifying scrutiny in Washington.    The CEOs will be on the defensive as House lawmakers grill them about whether the business empire each company has created has resulted in monopoly-like dominance that distorts the marketplace in their favor.    After enjoying more than a decade virtually free of federal regulation, House lawmakers are expected to make the case that it\u2019s time for the technology behemoths to be held to account.    The hearing caps a more than year-long House investigation into the Big Tech companies, which has probed whether the industry leaders box out competition, discourage innovation and pose larger threats to society and American democracy.    If Washington can keep the bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley, the hearing could set the stage for historic regulations, but the tech CEOs will be making the case to lawmakers that laws aimed at reining in the scale and power of each company are not necessary, contending that competition among rivals has not been squashed and that consumers have benefited from the technology sector\u2019s success.    \u201cYou earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well \u2014 delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they\u2019re unpopular,\u201d Bezos will tell the subcommittee.    Unpopular among the four tech giants: the argument that the power each company has amassed over the years is being abused and needs to be held accountable by Washington.   Copyright 2020 NPR.

Not surprisingly, the tech giants' chief executives told Congress: absolutely not. The concern that too much power is concentrated in too few companies is unfounded, they said Wednesday.    Does Apple punish its rivals on the App Store to score more customers?    Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath drew attention to Apple's Screen Time app, a service allowing parents to limit their kids' phone use.    When Apple introduced the app, in 2018, competing parental control apps, such as OurPact, were booted from the App Store for not meeting Apple's safety requirements.    Apple CEO Tim Cook told McBath those fears were justified.    \"We were concerned, Congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\" Cook said, noting the app was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \"So we were worried about their safety.\"    But McBath said House investigators discovered that rival parental control apps that were kicked out of the App Store were readmitted six months later without making significant privacy overhauls.    \"Of course, six months is truly an eternity for small businesses to be shut down, even worse if all the while a larger competitor is actually taking away customers,\" she said.    McBath pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple's Screen Time.

McBath referenced a second example involving the publisher Random House, which says Apple held back the introduction of its app as Apple pushed its own similar product.    \"Even some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\" McBath said. \"This is fundamentally unfair,\" she said. \"Ultimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that's a great concern to all of us.\"    -- Bobby Allyn    CEO vows Google won't play favorites in 2020 election    Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced a barrage of questions from Rep. Jim Jordan. The Ohio Republican said he's concerned that Google will tailor its search engine to give a leg up to presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden over President Trump in searches related to the November election.    When Jordan asked Pichai for a promise to Americans that Google will not favor Biden in the 2020 election, Pichai said \"we don't do any work to politically tilt anything one way or another.\"    Jordan persisted with the same question.    Pichai, eventually, agreed to make a commitment that Google will not tilt its features to help Biden and that the search engine will not be used to silence conservatives.    \"Yeah, you have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way,\" Pichai said.    It's a line of inquiry that is far afield from the purpose of the hearing, noted Pennsylvania Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon, saying she'd like to turn the focus back to antitrust, rather than \"fringe conspiracy theories.\"    This incited Jordan, who interrupted Scanlon, launching a screaming match between Jordan and Democratic leadership about following the rules of the hearing.    \"When someone comes after my motives for asking questions,\" shouted Jordan, \"I should get a chance to respond.\"    -- Bobby Allyn    Does Amazon use sellers' data to help itself?    The first inquiry for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos finally arrived from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., some two hours into the hearing. In detailed substantive questions, she zeroed in on the subcommittee's central concern about Amazon: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos said, explaining that Amazon had \"certain safeguards\" including a policy against this kind of use of seller-specific data. However, he said he could not \"guarantee that the policy has not been violated.\"    Committee lawmakers have previously accused Amazon of \" lack of candor \" about how it might be using other sellers' data to boost its own business. Critics have made the case , for example, that Amazon employees may have used such data to create the retailer's own private-label products, which Bezos told lawmakers the company was still investigating.    \"You can set the rules for your competitors but not actually follow the rules yourself,\" Jayapal said. \"You have access to data that your competitors do not have,\" she continued, adding that if Amazon was \"continuously monitoring\" such data to make sure that other sellers \"are never going to get big enough that they can compete with you \u2014 that is the concern that the committee has.\"    --Alina Selyukh    Google's Pichai is pressed on being \"the gateway to the Internet\"    Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline spent all of his first 5-minute block of questions on Google \u2014 the company at most immediate risk of actual antitrust action. The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to sue the company over its advertising business, and could be joined by state attorneys general who have also been investigating Google.    Cicilline pressed CEO Sundar Pichai on whether Google's business model presents a conflict of interest, because it has an incentive to give search results that keep users on its own site rather than anywhere else on the Internet.    \"As Google became the gateway to the Internet, it began to abuse its power,\" Cicilline said.    Pichai responded that Google \"always focuses on providing users the most relevant information.\" Cicilline appeared annoyed at Pichai's answers, cutting him off several times to move to another question.    --Shannon Bond    Still waiting for questions for Jeff Bezos    Over an hour-and-a-half into the hearing, Jeff Bezos \u2014 appearing in Congress for the first time, whose company employs a million workers and has over 150 million paying subscribers \u2014 has yet to receive a single question.    His presence was slated to become a powerful accomplishment of the House Judiciary Committee, but the questioning so far has left him muted on the live video feed, reaching for some snacks.    Jeff Bezos hasn't been asked a single question by Congress yet, so the world's richest man is having a snack... pic.twitter.com/zMZ4iEuHyY  \u2014 Claire Reilly (@reillystyley) July 29, 2020   The hearing, meanwhile, is taking a 10-minute break to fix a technical problem \"with one of our witnesses.\"    --Alina Selyukh    Did Facebook buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor?    Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook's Zuckerberg on exactly why his company bought Instagram for $1 billion back in 2012. That's a key part of competition questions facing the social media giant. Critics accuse Facebook of buying or copying rivals \u2014 like Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 to squash competition.    Nadler said in its investigation, the committee got documents from Facebook in which Zuckerberg discussed \"neutralizing a competitor\" as a reason to pursue Instagram.    Documents from the Hearing on \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\" pic.twitter.com/b14sEfZkBJ  \u2014 House Judiciary Dems (@HouseJudiciary) July 29, 2020   \"Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook. And so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it,\" Nadler said.    Zuckerberg points out that the Federal Trade Commission okayed the merger at the time. \"With hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\" he said.    Cicilline interjected to say that the \"failures\" of the FTC in 2012 do not mean it was not a violation of antitrust law.    --Shannon Bond    Panel chairman: Under coronavirus, big tech \"likely to emerge stronger and more powerful\"    Up first is Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee that's holding this hearing. He is the driving force behind the year-long investigation of big tech.    In his opening remarks , he describes the dominance of each company: Amazon in online shopping, Apple in smartphones and apps, Facebook in social media and Google in search and ads. And he points out that thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, all four \"are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"    \"As American families shift more of their work, shopping, and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned businesses, meanwhile \u2014mom and pop stores on Main Street \u2014 face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history,\" Cicilline said.    House antitrust chair Cicilline notes through-lines uniting the four different tech giants:  -\"bottleneck for a key channel of distribution\"  -use \"control over digital infrastructure to surveil other companies\"  -\"abuse ... control over current technologies to extend their power\"  \u2014 Alina Selyukh (@alinaselyukh) July 29, 2020   The committee's investigation has turned up a pattern among the tech giants, he said. They control access to information and marketplaces, use that control to \"surveil\" rivals and protect their power, and favor their own businesses.    \"Simply put: They have too much power,\" Cicilline said. For consumers, he said, this is reminiscent of previous American monopolies: railroads, oil and telephone companies, and even another tech giant \u2014 Microsoft.    \"This investigation also goes to the heart of whether we, as a people, govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies,\" he said. \"Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"    --Shannon Bond    Republican Jim Jordan: \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives\"    Wednesday's hearing is supposed to be about Big Tech's power and market dominance. But Republicans are already trying to make it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his fiery opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.    He also mentioned Twitter, even though it is not part of the hearing. Jordan said conservative members of Congress were \"shadow banned\" on Twitter. He said Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey said it was a glitch.    \"If I had a nickel for every time I heard it was just a glitch, I wouldn't be as wealthy as our witnesses, but I'd be doing right,\" Jordan said.    \"We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact election,\" Jordan said. \"\"If it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.\"    Before Jordan's remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief, strongly contested by large tech companies, that conservatives do not get a fair shake by the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship troubling.    \"Conservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\" Sensenbrenner said.    The hearing erupted in chaos after Jordan asked that Rep. Mike Johnson of the House Judiciary's Constitution subcommittee be allowed to participate in the hearing. The request was denied.    Jordan then repeatedly interrupted antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, who was attempting to introduce Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.    \"We're talking about peoples' liberties here,\" Jordan said over Cicilline.    \"Put your mask on,\" Jordan was told.    --Bobby Allyn    Trump tweets: 'Bring fairness to Big Tech'    The hearing has gotten underway, after an hour-long delay. First up, we will get opening statements from the top members of the committee and the four CEOs. Then lawmakers will each get five minutes to question Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg. All four will be joining remotely, via video.    The focus of the hearing, and the committee's investigation, is competition \u2014 but expect lawmakers to be unable to resist bringing up other complaints about tech companies, from election security and the spread of misinformation to alleged anti-conservative bias.    That's also the message coming from the White House, where President Trump has repeatedly accused tech companies of treating him unfairly. Shortly after noon, he tweeted : \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"    --Shannon Bond    Our original story by Bobby Allyn continues:    Amid a time of rising tensions with China, some of the powerful CEOs will suggest that too much regulation could provide an opportunity for Chinese tech firms to gain a global toehold, according to opening remarks from the tech leaders released by the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.    \"We believe in values \u2014 democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression  \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\" Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg will tell lawmakers, according to his prepared opening statement . \"China is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.\"    Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person who will be making his first-ever appearance in front of Congress, will bring in his personal story of being adopted by an immigrant father when he was 4 years old and spending his summers on his grandparents' ranch in Texas, saying his upbringing instilled in him a work ethic that has helped Amazon prosper.    Amazon's rise to becoming the largest online retailer, Bezos will say, is an achievement only made possible in America. But Walmart, he will point out, is still twice the size of Amazon.    \"We did not start out as the largest marketplace \u2014 eBay was many times our size. It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay,\" Bezos says in his released testimony .    Google's Sundar Pichai will steer attention to the other ways people navigate the online world, even though 90% of Internet searches happen on Google.    \"People have more ways to search for information than ever before \u2014 and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine,\" Pichai plans to tell the House panel. \"You can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest.\"    Apple's Tim Cook will echo the appeals to patriotism raised among the other tech CEOs by touting how Apple's strength, becoming the most valuable company in the world, represents success \"only possible in this country.\"    He will also join the other tech leaders by arguing that Apple has plenty of competition.    \"The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches,\" Cook will say in his opening statement to lawmakers.    Whether members of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee buy these arguments over the course of what is set to be an hourslong spectacle is another matter.    And it remains to be seen if the public will gain new insight into the tech companies, and whether lawmakers can pin down answers from the typically cautious technology executives.    The CEOs will be testifying via video at the same time, rather than one by one, a format seen as taking the heat off any individual executive and something the companies requested.    While the hearing centers on questions around market dominance, lawmakers are free to pepper the executives with questions about any topic.    The anything-goes format will likely divert the hearing away from antitrust and delve into issues like perceived anti-conservative bias on social media platforms, a common Republican refrain. And Democrats, often raising concern about foreign election meddling, may inquire about possible efforts to influence the vote online ahead of the November election.    More on-topic probing could involve issues like acquisitions that have grown the reach of Big Tech.    For instance, Facebook has acquired nearly 90 companies, including Instagram,  WhatsApp and more recently, Giphy, a tool for creating animated images.    How ever it goes, one thing is certain: It will be a day for the history books.    The hearing is the first time all four technology leaders have testified together, as scrutiny over the companies' nearly $5 trillion market power draws intensifying scrutiny in Washington.    The CEOs will be on the defensive as House lawmakers grill them about whether the business empire each company has created has resulted in monopoly-like dominance that distorts the marketplace in their favor.    After enjoying more than a decade virtually free of federal regulation, House lawmakers are expected to make the case that it's time for the technology behemoths to be held to account.    The hearing caps a more than year-long House investigation into the Big Tech companies, which has probed whether the industry leaders box out competition, discourage innovation and pose larger threats to society and American democracy.    If Washington can keep the bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley, the hearing could set the stage for historic regulations, but the tech CEOs will be making the case to lawmakers that laws aimed at reining in the scale and power of each company are not necessary, contending that competition among rivals has not been squashed and that consumers have benefited from the technology sector's success.    \"You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well \u2014 delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular,\" Bezos will tell the subcommittee.    Unpopular among the four tech giants: the argument that the power each company has amassed over the years is being abused and needs to be held accountable by Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716364299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-11H1-JCSC-J4H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3219\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>KUNM</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Not surprisingly, the tech giants\u2019 chief executives told Congress: absolutely not. The concern that too much power is concentrated in too few companies is unfounded, they said Wednesday.    Does Apple punish its rivals on the App Store to score more customers?    Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath drew attention to Apple\u2019s Screen Time app, a service allowing parents to limit their kids\u2019 phone use.    When Apple introduced the app, in 2018, competing parental control apps, such as OurPact, were booted from the App Store for not meeting Apple\u2019s safety requirements.    Apple CEO Tim Cook told McBath those fears were justified.    \u201cWe were concerned, Congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\u201d Cook said, noting the app was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \u201cSo we were worried about their safety.\u201d    But McBath said House investigators discovered that rival parental control apps that were kicked out of the App Store were readmitted six months later without making significant privacy overhauls.    \u201cOf course, six months is truly an eternity for small businesses to be shut down, even worse if all the while a larger competitor is actually taking away customers,\u201d she said.    McBath pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple\u2019s Screen Time.    Cook said \u201cthere are many reasons why\u201d an app may not meet the App Store\u2019s guidelines, dismissing the suggestion that Apple squashed its competition to favor its own service.    McBath referenced a second example involving the publisher Random House, which says Apple held back the introduction of its app as Apple pushed its own similar product.    \u201cEven some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\u201d McBath said. \u201cThis is fundamentally unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that\u2019s a great concern to all of us.\u201d    \u2014 Bobby Allyn    CEO vows Google won\u2019t play favorites in 2020 election    Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced a barrage of questions from Rep. Jim Jordan. The Ohio Republican said he\u2019s concerned that Google will tailor its search engine to give a leg up to presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden over President Trump in searches related to the November election.    When Jordan asked Pichai for a promise to Americans that Google will not favor Biden in the 2020 election, Pichai said \u201cwe don\u2019t do any work to politically tilt anything one way or another.\u201d    Jordan persisted with the same question.    Pichai, eventually, agreed to make a commitment that Google will not tilt its features to help Biden and that the search engine will not be used to silence conservatives.    \u201cYeah, you have my commitment. It\u2019s always been true and we\u2019ll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way,\u201d Pichai said.    It\u2019s a line of inquiry that is far afield from the purpose of the hearing, noted Pennsylvania Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon, saying she\u2019d like to turn the focus back to antitrust, rather than \u201cfringe conspiracy theories.\u201d    This incited Jordan, who interrupted Scanlon, launching a screaming match between Jordan and Democratic leadership about following the rules of the hearing.    \u201cWhen someone comes after my motives for asking questions,\u201d shouted Jordan, \u201cI should get a chance to respond.\u201d    \u2014 Bobby Allyn    Does Amazon use sellers\u2019 data to help itself?    The first inquiry for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos finally arrived from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., some two hours into the hearing. In detailed substantive questions, she zeroed in on the subcommittee\u2019s central concern about Amazon: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d Bezos said, explaining that Amazon had \u201ccertain safeguards\u201d including a policy against this kind of use of seller-specific data. However, he said he could not \u201cguarantee that the policy has not been violated.\u201d    Committee lawmakers have previously accused Amazon of \u201c lack of candor \u201d about how it might be using other sellers\u2019 data to boost its own business. Critics have made the case , for example, that Amazon employees may have used such data to create the retailer\u2019s own private-label products, which Bezos told lawmakers the company was still investigating.    \u201cYou can set the rules for your competitors but not actually follow the rules yourself,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cYou have access to data that your competitors do not have,\u201d she continued, adding that if Amazon was \u201ccontinuously monitoring\u201d such data to make sure that other sellers \u201care never going to get big enough that they can compete with you \u2014 that is the concern that the committee has.\u201d    \u2013Alina Selyukh    Google\u2019s Pichai is pressed on being \u201cthe gateway to the Internet\u201d    Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline spent all of his first 5-minute block of questions on Google \u2014 the company at most immediate risk of actual antitrust action. The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to sue the company over its advertising business, and could be joined by state attorneys general who have also been investigating Google.    Cicilline pressed CEO Sundar Pichai on whether Google\u2019s business model presents a conflict of interest, because it has an incentive to give search results that keep users on its own site rather than anywhere else on the Internet.    \u201cAs Google became the gateway to the Internet, it began to abuse its power,\u201d Cicilline said.    Pichai responded that Google \u201calways focuses on providing users the most relevant information.\u201d Cicilline appeared annoyed at Pichai\u2019s answers, cutting him off several times to move to another question.    \u2013Shannon Bond    Still waiting for questions for Jeff Bezos    Over an hour-and-a-half into the hearing, Jeff Bezos \u2014 appearing in Congress for the first time, whose company employs a million workers and has over 150 million paying subscribers \u2014 has yet to receive a single question.    His presence was slated to become a powerful accomplishment of the House Judiciary Committee, but the questioning so far has left him muted on the live video feed, reaching for some snacks.    The hearing, meanwhile, is taking a 10-minute break to fix a technical problem \u201cwith one of our witnesses.\u201d    \u2013Alina Selyukh    Did Facebook buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor?    Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg on exactly why his company bought Instagram for $1 billion back in 2012. That\u2019s a key part of competition questions facing the social media giant. Critics accuse Facebook of buying or copying rivals \u2014 like Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 to squash competition.    Nadler said in its investigation, the committee got documents from Facebook in which Zuckerberg discussed \u201cneutralizing a competitor\u201d as a reason to pursue Instagram.    \u201cFacebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook. And so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it,\u201d Nadler said.    Zuckerberg points out that the Federal Trade Commission okayed the merger at the time. \u201cWith hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\u201d he said.    Cicilline interjected to say that the \u201cfailures\u201d of the FTC in 2012 do not mean it was not a violation of antitrust law.    \u2013Shannon Bond    Panel chairman: Under coronavirus, big tech \u201clikely to emerge stronger and more powerful\u201d    Up first is Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee that\u2019s holding this hearing. He is the driving force behind the year-long investigation of big tech.    In his opening remarks , he describes the dominance of each company: Amazon in online shopping, Apple in smartphones and apps, Facebook in social media and Google in search and ads. And he points out that thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, all four \u201care likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.\u201d    \u201cAs American families shift more of their work, shopping, and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned businesses, meanwhile \u2014mom and pop stores on Main Street \u2014 face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history,\u201d Cicilline said.    The committee\u2019s investigation has turned up a pattern among the tech giants, he said. They control access to information and marketplaces, use that control to \u201csurveil\u201d rivals and protect their power, and favor their own businesses.    \u201cSimply put: They have too much power,\u201d Cicilline said. For consumers, he said, this is reminiscent of previous American monopolies: railroads, oil and telephone companies, and even another tech giant \u2014 Microsoft.    \u201cThis investigation also goes to the heart of whether we, as a people, govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies,\u201d he said. \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d    \u2013Shannon Bond    Republican Jim Jordan: \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives\u201d    Wednesday\u2019s hearing is supposed to be about Big Tech\u2019s power and market dominance. But Republicans are already trying to make it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his fiery opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.    He also mentioned Twitter, even though it is not part of the hearing. Jordan said conservative members of Congress were \u201cshadow banned\u201d on Twitter. He said Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey said it was a glitch.    \u201cIf I had a nickel for every time I heard it was just a glitch, I wouldn\u2019t be as wealthy as our witnesses, but I\u2019d be doing right,\u201d Jordan said.    \u201cWe all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what\u2019s not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact election,\u201d Jordan said. \u201c\u201dIf it doesn\u2019t end, there has to be consequences.\u201d    Before Jordan\u2019s remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief, strongly contested by large tech companies, that conservatives do not get a fair shake by the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship troubling.    \u201cConservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\u201d Sensenbrenner said.    The hearing erupted in chaos after Jordan asked that Rep. Mike Johnson of the House Judiciary\u2019s Constitution subcommittee be allowed to participate in the hearing. The request was denied.    Jordan then repeatedly interrupted antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, who was attempting to introduce Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.    \u201cWe\u2019re talking about peoples\u2019 liberties here,\u201d Jordan said over Cicilline.    \u201cPut your mask on,\u201d Jordan was told.    \u2013Bobby Allyn    Trump tweets: \u2018Bring fairness to Big Tech\u2019    The hearing has gotten underway, after an hour-long delay. First up, we will get opening statements from the top members of the committee and the four CEOs. Then lawmakers will each get five minutes to question Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg. All four will be joining remotely, via video.    The focus of the hearing, and the committee\u2019s investigation, is competition \u2014 but expect lawmakers to be unable to resist bringing up other complaints about tech companies, from election security and the spread of misinformation to alleged anti-conservative bias.    That\u2019s also the message coming from the White House, where President Trump has repeatedly accused tech companies of treating him unfairly. Shortly after noon, he tweeted : \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\u201d    \u2013Shannon Bond    Our original story by Bobby Allyn continues:    Amid a time of rising tensions with China, some of the powerful CEOs will suggest that too much regulation could provide an opportunity for Chinese tech firms to gain a global toehold, according to opening remarks from the tech leaders released by the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.    \u201cWe believe in values \u2014 democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression  \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg will tell lawmakers, according to his prepared opening statement . \u201cChina is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.\u201d    Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person who will be making his first-ever appearance in front of Congress, will bring in his personal story of being adopted by an immigrant father when he was 4 years old and spending his summers on his grandparents\u2019 ranch in Texas, saying his upbringing instilled in him a work ethic that has helped Amazon prosper.    Amazon\u2019s rise to becoming the largest online retailer, Bezos will say, is an achievement only made possible in America. But Walmart, he will point out, is still twice the size of Amazon.    \u201cWe did not start out as the largest marketplace \u2014 eBay was many times our size. It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay,\u201d Bezos says in his released testimony .    Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai will steer attention to the other ways people navigate the online world, even though 90% of Internet searches happen on Google.    \u201cPeople have more ways to search for information than ever before \u2014 and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine,\u201d Pichai plans to tell the House panel. \u201cYou can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest.\u201d    Apple\u2019s Tim Cook will echo the appeals to patriotism raised among the other tech CEOs by touting how Apple\u2019s strength, becoming the most valuable company in the world, represents success \u201conly possible in this country.\u201d    He will also join the other tech leaders by arguing that Apple has plenty of competition.    \u201cThe smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches,\u201d Cook will say in his opening statement to lawmakers.    Whether members of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee buy these arguments over the course of what is set to be an hourslong spectacle is another matter.    And it remains to be seen if the public will gain new insight into the tech companies, and whether lawmakers can pin down answers from the typically cautious technology executives.    The CEOs will be testifying via video at the same time, rather than one by one, a format seen as taking the heat off any individual executive and something the companies requested.    While the hearing centers on questions around market dominance, lawmakers are free to pepper the executives with questions about any topic.    The anything-goes format will likely divert the hearing away from antitrust and delve into issues like perceived anti-conservative bias on social media platforms, a common Republican refrain. And Democrats, often raising concern about foreign election meddling, may inquire about possible efforts to influence the vote online ahead of the November election.    More on-topic probing could involve issues like acquisitions that have grown the reach of Big Tech.    For instance, Facebook has acquired nearly 90 companies, including Instagram,  WhatsApp and more recently, Giphy, a tool for creating animated images.    How ever it goes, one thing is certain: It will be a day for the history books.    The hearing is the first time all four technology leaders have testified together, as scrutiny over the companies\u2019 nearly $5 trillion market power draws intensifying scrutiny in Washington.    The CEOs will be on the defensive as House lawmakers grill them about whether the business empire each company has created has resulted in monopoly-like dominance that distorts the marketplace in their favor.    After enjoying more than a decade virtually free of federal regulation, House lawmakers are expected to make the case that it\u2019s time for the technology behemoths to be held to account.    The hearing caps a more than year-long House investigation into the Big Tech companies, which has probed whether the industry leaders box out competition, discourage innovation and pose larger threats to society and American democracy.    If Washington can keep the bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley, the hearing could set the stage for historic regulations, but the tech CEOs will be making the case to lawmakers that laws aimed at reining in the scale and power of each company are not necessary, contending that competition among rivals has not been squashed and that consumers have benefited from the technology sector\u2019s success.    \u201cYou earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well \u2014 delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they\u2019re unpopular,\u201d Bezos will tell the subcommittee.    Unpopular among the four tech giants: the argument that the power each company has amassed over the years is being abused and needs to be held accountable by Washington.   Copyright 2020 NPR.

Some have wondered if the FDA, in its current form, is up to the task, which will undoubtedly grow and become more complex. Some in Congress have introduced bills [1]calling for a new FDA office specifically tasked with approving and monitoring health apps. </p><p>The vast majority of the consumer health apps you'll find in the app stores are harmless, like step counters and heart beat monitors. They're non-clinical, non-actionable, and informational or motivational in nature. But the next wave of biometric devices and apps might go further, measuring things like\u00a0real-time blood pressure, blood glucose, and oxygen levels. You'll begin to see these more advanced biometrics as we move from single-purpose fitness trackers like FitBit to more all-purpose devices like Apple's upcoming 'iWatch.'[2] More clinical apps It's these more clinical\u00a0apps and devices that concern the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is\u00a0charged with keeping watch on the safety and efficacy of consumer health products. 'It's these apps that the FDA says it will regulate,'\u00a0David Bates, MD[3] of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Physicians Organization told VentureBeat in June. These apps will have to go through the full 510(k) process[4],' he said. Dr. Bates chaired a group o advise the FDA on how to review health apps\u00a0for approval, and on how the FDA should advise developers.\u00a0'It was intended to help them think through the risk factors involved with these products\u00a0and then give guidance on how to stay within the guidelines,' he said. 'The device makers were asking from some guidance from The FDA on what types of things would be accepted and what wouldn't,' Bates said. Bates believes the FDA wants to use a light regulatory touch when looking at new medical devices. 'The FDA definitely wants innovation to continue in clinical devices,' he said. 'In general the FDA knows that the vast majority of apps are just informational.' The FDA's final guidance focuses on a small subset of mobile apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended. The FDA's position FDA spokeswoman Jennifer Rodriguez writes in an email to VentureBeat that her agency has become more focused in its regulation of heath apps. 'The mobile medical apps that the FDA is focusing on may impact the performance or functionality of currently regulated medical devices or may independently pose a greater risk to consumers,' she writes. The FDA, she writes, is mainly concerned with two types of app/device combinations: Apps that are used as an accessory to medical device already regulated by the FDA (for example, an application that allows a clinician to access an image from a hospital image database, then make a specific diagnosis based on it.) Apps that are turn a regular smartphone or tablet into a medical device by using the device's sensors, software or accessories for some diagnostic purpose (for example, an app that turns a smartphone into an ECG machine to detect abnormal heart rhythms). 'We encourage app developers to contact the FDA as early as possible if they have any questions about their mobile app, its level of risk, and whether a premarket application is required,' Rodriguez adds. The problem is that the line between 'consumer-focused' and 'clinical-focused' may be getting blurrier \u2014 and may continue to move. Some of the consumer health apps and devices that will soon be connecting with the new health platforms offered by large tech companies like Apple (Health Kit)[5] and Google (Google Fit)[6] may present new mixtures of clinical and non-clinical features and functions. The agency is now, and will need to continue, refining its review and approval process for such products. A costly process And many app and device developers may look for\u00a0reasons to assume their product falls outside the scope of the agency. They won't have to look very hard. 'The FDA approval process is a lengthy one and there is a significant capital outlay involved,' Brigham and Womens' Bates told VentureBeat. 'They must pay for attorneys to help with the long application preparation process.' Many developers have, and will likely continue to 'go it alone,' developing independent of\u00a0FDA guidelines, under the assumption that their product is non-clinical. And what about the apps and devices that receive FDA approval, then pivot or evolve into a more clinically oriented purpose later on? Those two groups create a large class\u00a0of products that exist outside the regulatory gaze, and could potentially harm consumers if they give inaccurate or otherwise misleading information. An inaccurate blood pressure or blood glucose level reading could lead to an unnecessary trip to the emergency room. Or worse, and app might fail to detect a serious problem, causing the user to neglect to seek necessary medical help. A new FDA group Epstein Becker Green attorney Brad Thompson believes the FDA needs a special group to monitor consumer health apps and devices that are already being used in the wild. 'Within the compliance division at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, (that's the unit within FDA that has responsibility for medical devices), they should develop a small unit, perhaps even just one person, to spend their time looking at the various mobile app marketplaces, searching for certain keywords that are indicative of FDA regulated functionality,' Thompson says. Thompson advises medical device, drug, and combination product companies on FDA regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical trial issues. 'When they find an app where the promotion seems to cross the line into regulated territory, they should send a gentle letter to the company pointing that out and asking what they've done to come into compliance,' Thompson says. 'It would really not take much in the way of resources to do exactly that. I think they're doing a little bit of that now, but not very much,' he adds. Health apps go mainstream The big software companies (Apple, Google, and Samsung) have brought attention to, and lent credibility to, apps and devices that do more than count steps. These companies are building large cloud platforms designed to collect health data from all sorts of health apps and devices. But most agree that none of these software giants want to get caught up in any large scale entanglements with government agencies over product safety regulations. 'At the end of the day, whatever they [the large tech companies] create should be designed to be interoperable with both the consumer world and clinical world,' says Dr. Molly Malouf, MD, an expert in digital health technology, in an email to VentureBeat. 'The big tech companies have to be smart enough to recognize the regulatory barriers and to hire FDA approval experts,' Malouf says. And what if the devices and apps connecting with these large clouds do start trending toward serious clinical and diagnostic applications? Would the big platform plays like Health Kit, Google Fit[7], and SAMI suddenly be reconsidered and shut down after causing the companies too much legal exposure? Well, it wouldn't be the first time. Look no further than Google's doomed attempt[8]\u00a0at putting health records online back in 2011. <url normalizedValue=\"http://events.venturebeat.com/event/healthbeat2014/?utm_source=venturebeatutm_medium=boilerplateutm_content=bottomutm_campaign=gamesbeat2014HealthBeat\">http://events.venturebeat.com/event/healthbeat2014/?utm_source=venturebeatutm_medium=boilerplateutm_content=bottomutm_campaign=gamesbeat2014HealthBeat</url>[9] \u2014 VentureBeat's breakthrough health tech event \u2014 is returning on Oct 27-28 in San Francisco.

Healthcare investors will reinvest. With cash from last year's tax reform law, they see more significant opportunity. By giving traditional healthcare companies the chance to sell Non-Core assets and increase Core assets, they are more desirable investments.</p><p>Political wrangling over U.S. healthcare won't be resolved in 2019, leaving States to set policy directions. Organizations operating in more than one state may be hard-pressed to develop comprehensive business strategies. While waiting to see if the government will reform the Affordable Care Act, they may not need to. Technology and Consumer choice could be the drivers forcing this change. With the possibility of a looming recession, consumers cannot afford the premiums offered under ACA and want other options. In Seventeen states, excluding California, many people have elected temporary health plans, which are l/3rd the price of ACA. They offer coverage for 364 days and can be renewed 3 times. That extra day of non-coverage allows them not to include Pre-existing conditions each renewable year. These are plans which offer protection on a \"claims made\" basis. They are great savings for healthy consumers who want the unexpected covered. With the luxury of changing to traditional ACA plans during open enrollment each year, a consumer with a newly developed Medical condition can elect to enroll in ACA for the coming year and have the protection of unlimited lifetime coverage.</p><p>More Healthcare products and services will be developed and offered to meet the needs of the consumer. Many consumers who have opted out of purchasing the current highly inflated ACA metal plans want to buy just the protection they need, as opposed to government model plans with all the bells and whistles. These are the benefits which have escalated premiums. To keep premiums affordable, the consumer is left to elect for high deductible plans and end up paying for most of the services they will use. The consumer no longer pays the penalty for not being insured. With the advent of a menu of stand-alone services, they could purchase these benefits to fit their needs and re-insure on ACA at annual enrollment, in the event of a significant illness.</p><p>Meanwhile, consumers want more choices in how they receive care. Most consumers polled said they would opt to receive hospital care at home if it cost less than an inpatient stay. In determining the results comparing patients in recovery in their homes vs. hospital care, patients have experienced excellent results. By healing from home, their immune systems are not subject to foreign bacteria which they are subject to in facilities.</p><p>Primary care for routine exams, preventative injections will begin to be done ins Large package stores, like Walmart, Rite Aid, etc.</p><p>Many consumers polled said they would try an FDA-approved app or online tool to treat a medical condition. Big tech firms, like Google or Microsoft, will begin to offer more services in the health-related field. Patients will see increased usage of digital treatments, by using an app. or digital program to assist in their treatment. To improve better outcomes, digital therapeutics and devices connected to patients will be used to determine the success of therapies.</p><p>The coming year will also see providers switch to Telehealth-based 24/7 \"care models\" by using artificial intelligence, and robotic process automation and other technologies. Such technologies will be \"key\" to helping companies shift, as well as reducing manual entry and analysis tasks. It will help to reduce costs and contribute to expedite improved services to the patient.</p><p>Tax reform will also cut costs for For-Profit entities, putting them at a more competitive advantage. Nonprofit hospitals and other tax-exempt organizations could face more tax liability due to requirements around fringe benefits and the elimination of an incentive for certain people to contribute to charitable groups.</p><p>Drug and medical device companies will face uncertainties from tariffs and evolving trade pressures from foreign trading partners, including China, Mexico, and Canada. Drug and device makers could face steeper prices for materials and chemicals, while hospitals could see costs of medical supplies rise and the potential for shortages.</p><p>By altering several provisions to the Affordable Care Act, a reduction in premiums is forecasted. Medicaid expansion, especially in the Red States, will help to reduce charity care.</p><p>It looks like a healthier HealthCare year for all.</p><p>Janice Gough is a Safe Financial Adviser in Palm Springs.

The comment was posted on Aug. 20, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is Facebook's Support Groups Product a Personal Health Record under the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer must either be \"yes\" or \"no\" and no matter what answer you choose, there is no good news. If the answer is \"yes\" then the FTC has completely failed to enforce its regulation, conceding to Big Tech's Big Lawyers and failing to protect the public from flagrant violations on Facebook's part.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the answer is \"no\" then there is no point to the PHR breach notification rule. It is so narrow that avoiding it is as trivial as simply naming your product differently and it offers no protection at all to the public. And if the FTC has a rule that is so narrow that it cannot be enforced then the public has no protections at all from Big Tech lying about how it mines clinical data from the public and then lying about how they sell it to organizations that use it against the public.</p><p>Before we get into this question, let me warn you. If you work with patients, if you care about public health, if you have a health condition and are using Facebook to find answers from other patients, then no matter what the answer is, I think you will be frustrated.</p><p>Facebook's content algorithms have the effect of routing patients away from legitimate care and towards snake-oil offerings. The New York Times opinion piece \" I Have Cancer. Now My Facebook Feed Is Full of 'Alternative Care' Ads. \" and corresponding discussion on Slashdot are the right starting place for documenting this issue in full. The healthcare policies at Facebook have profound implications, and the notion that it does not qualify for the FTC PHR regulations means that no regulation at all applies to how Facebook should be conducting itself around the healthcare data it gathers from its users and how it chooses to share that clinical data.</p><p>For those of you who are not healthcare policy wonks, it is critical to bear in mind that any healthcare information you provide to your professional healthcare worker, including doctors, nurses and hospitals, is covered by an expansive and well-understood law called HIPAA in the United States. But HIPAA does not cover any institution who has your healthcare information that is not itself connected to the provision of healthcare. Google, Facebook and Amazon are not covered. When you search for a book on \"Herpes Dating\" on Amazon, that is not protected by HIPAA. If you search for \"Herpes Treatments\" on Google, there is no regulation to protect you from Google sharing that information, other than Google's promise that it will not share that information.</p><p>The regulatory approach that Congress has taken towards the clinical information that these tech giants gather has been almost entirely hands off. There is one exception. The FTC PHR Breach Notification Rule . The general consensus among policy makers is that this regulation is definitely not enough. And the European Union has already passed the much more substantial General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). The US continues its minimalist approach and so what little regulation does exist is ineffective and deeply problematic. Whether the answer to the question is \"yes\" or \"no\" the public has been done a disservice by the enforcement history of this regulation. Perhaps it is a Congressional failure, for making a regulation that the FTC cannot enforce. I believe that the FTC is substantially at fault for refusing to consider Facebook as covered by the regulation. But no matter the answer, the current situation is not working.</p><p>It should be considered an important part of the trend of Big Tech \"working around\" regulations they find cumbersome.</p><p>The FTC has decided that Facebook is not a PHR because Facebook has simply said \"we do not advertise our product as a PHR and therefore we are not a PHR\". This is equivalent to saying that Ford could avoid all automobile emissions regulations, merely by insisting that it sells \"horseless carriages\" rather than trucks. Imagine the massive benefits to Ford! They could save thousands of dollars on each \"carriage\" by not bothering with modern emissions standards. And if the Ford F150 was ten thousand dollars cheaper than it is, every truck buyer in the country would choose to have a \"horseless carriage\" from Ford. This would of course force Chevy and Toyota to immediately label their products as \"horseless carriages\", negating the profound improvements to public health due to smog reduction in the US. This kind of \"product name loophole\" in the auto industry would negate decades of improvements to daily life that these regulations have provided. Of course, this is not how automobile regulations work. Renaming a product does not exempt a vehicle from emissions requirements. But that is, apparently, exactly how it works when discussing the regulation of Big Tech regarding the sharing of personal health data online.</p><p>This article will soon become very wonky, delving into the specific details of Facebook's regulatory avoidance and how the FTC has facilitated this. But the takeaway is this: The FTC has completely failed to protect patients who use Facebook's platform, and because of that, both healthcare providers and patients should avoid the platform entirely. Moreover, we should demand effective, GDPR-style regulations for US tech companies to ensure that these kinds of problems are not the standard.</p><p>The FTC hosts a page that explains what it means to be a Personal Health Record or PHR. From that page:</p><p>For the purposes of the Rule, your business is a vendor of personal health records if it \"offers or maintains a personal health record.\" A personal health record is defined as an electronic record of \"identifiable health information on an individual that can be drawn from multiple sources and that is managed, shared, and controlled by or primarily for the individual.\"</p><p>The bold emphasis is mine.</p><p>At first blush, it seems clear to me that Facebook's Clinical Support Groups product meets these requirements.</p><p>I am not alone in thinking this. But I want to argue that Facebook meets the PHR definition, more than others might have done in the past.</p><p>What PHR-like activity is happening on Facebook?</p><p>Facebook has a \"type\" of Group called a \"support\" Group. Thousands of patients use these support Groups to get clarity on healthcare questions from other patients and from healthcare experts. There are tens of thousands of these Groups. I would be dubious of any assertion that there is any social platform or PHR platform that has as many patients or patient communities as Facebook. I suspect that Facebook has an order of magnitude more sharing of personal health information than any other technical platform on the planet.</p><p>Go to Facebook, search for any healthcare condition and you will see that there is a patient Group for it. So far I have been able to find a Group for every condition I have thought of. Usually more than one, and usually at least one that is very active. Please get ahold of me if you have a medical condition that does not have any Facebook Group associated with it. It seems so comprehensive, that I doubt I will get many takers.</p><p>There are likely millions or tens of millions of people who are putting their clinical information into Facebook in order to get clinical content that is specific to them.</p><p>But does that make the Facebook platform a PHR?</p><p>Is the definition met?</p><p>Let's break the definition into its elements. These are ordered to make them easier to discuss, rather than the order they are listed in the definition.</p><p>* Is it \"electronic\"?</p><p>* Is it a \"record\"?</p><p>* Is it \"identifiable\"?</p><p>* Is it \"on an individual\"?</p><p>* Is it \"managed\" by or for the individual?</p><p>* Is it \"shared\" by or for the individual?</p><p>* Is it \"controlled\" by or for the individual?</p><p>* Is it \"health information\"?</p><p>* Is it \"drawn from multiple sources\"?</p><p>* Lastly \"is it offered?\" by Facebook?</p><p>Is it \"electronic\"? There is no paper version of Facebook available. So \"yes\".</p><p>Is it a \"record\"? Things posted to Facebook are kept for decades, they are perfectly associated with a specific user account. So \"yes\".</p><p>The next two bullets essentially ask if the data is \"per person\" through the lense of \"identifiable health information\". Everything on Facebook is identifiable because of the controversial real name policy (as distinct from Twitter and Reddit which both support pseudonymity or \"throw away\" accounts that do not publicly link to a person's real world identity). There is no way to use Facebook in accordance with the Terms of Service (TOS) without using your real name for your account. Because of this it seems obvious that it is \"identifiable\" and it is \"on an individual\".</p><p>What about \"managed, shared and controlled\" by the individual? This is contrary to the \"window only\" model of personal health records where a user can see information, but has no power to share it. If there is anything on this list that is clearly true, it is that health information can be \"shared\" on Facebook. And of course, it can be managed or controlled as well, because a user can choose to change what they are sharing, and more importantly, can choose to change their healthcare behavior based on their Facebook interactions.</p><p>\"By or primarily for the individual\", means that the information must center around the user who posts it, and indeed that is the model that pervades patients who are using the Facebook Groups product for support purposes.</p><p>But is it \"health information\"?</p><p>Facebook specifically notes that people are expected to post \"stories\" about their healthcare experiences and health to these Groups. Can stories be \"health information\"? It's pretty hard to argue that they would not be. But patients also upload images, videos and other personal health content to the service as well, in the hopes that others in their community can help them understand those data. Posting images of clinical tests results for collaborative interpretation is common. This doesn't just happen occasionally, some Groups advertise this function as their sole purpose. So stories + photos + videos can certainly count as health information.</p><p>While the Facebook Groups product forms the backbone of its PHR functionality, Facebook also tracks other clinical information about users, including organ donor status. Features like this have caused the industry to hypothesize that Facebook was a PHR as far back as 2012 . They also have allowed Apps to gather clinical information (the article highlights ItTakesAllTypes.org which is an Facebook App that allows for gathering and sharing blood type information). There are hundreds of Apps like this, that gather clinical data about Facebook users... and of course there are tens of thousands of Facebook pages and Facebook Groups that have clinical focus. Does it even make sense to suggest that none of this is healthcare information? It seems pretty silly on its face.</p><p>Next the definition says \"can be drawn from multiple sources\". This one is optional, technically, because it says \"can\" and not \"must\", but multiple tools allow you to post clinical information directly to your Facebook timeline, such as Fitbit, etc. And of course a user can and does easily copy the information gathered in this manner to their Facebook Groups. So \"multiple sources\"...check!</p><p>The last point, however, is the most complex. Is it \"offered\" by Facebook?</p><p>Let's think about a counter example. Google Drive is an online document creation and sharing platform that Google releases. Is that a PHR? I am sure there are thousands of people who use the online spreadsheets from Google Drive to track and to share clinical information.</p><p>Imagine a diabetic who uses Google Drive spreadsheets to track blood sugar levels. Then they share this document electronically with their family and with their doctor. They ask their doctor to add in HA1C lab values periodically so that everything can be in one place. Let's go through the list above with this in mind!</p><p>* Is it \"electronic\"? Yep.</p><p>* Is it a \"record\"? Yep.</p><p>* Is it identifiable? Yes, most sharing is associated with specific email addresses.</p><p>* Is it \"on an individual\"? Yes.</p><p>* Is it \"managed\" by or for the individual? Yes - in our example it is both \"by\" and \"for\" (when the doctor ads data.)</p><p>* Is it \"shared\" by or for the individual? Yep.</p><p>* Is it \"controlled\" by or for the individual? Yep.</p><p>* Is it \"health information\"? Yep.</p><p>* Is it \"drawn from multiple sources\"? Yep, we listed two.</p><p>There is just one more question: \"Is it offered?\" The answer is no. Google Drive is a generic online tool that is not promoted for the purpose of tracking healthcare data.</p><p>But Facebook Groups are promoted by Facebook as a tool for managing healthcare issues.</p><p>Mark Zuckerburg, in at least two public settings, has recommended the \"support\" Facebook Group product for patient communities.</p><p>* At the 2018 Facebook F8 Keynote (at about 18:15)</p><p>* At the Communities Summit where an addiction support Group is labeled by Facebook as a safe place.</p><p>There are dozens of other instances where Facebook has explicitly indicated that an intended use case is people using the Groups product specifically to meet clinical needs and to track healthcare issues. Myself and other members of the patient community have already submitted an FTC complaint that listed many cases where Facebook has promoted the product in this manner.</p><p>The language used in the FTC definition makes you think of products which market themselves under the \"label\" of PHR. But Facebook markets its Groups as \"meeting the underlying use case\" without using the term \"Personal Health Record\". Essentially, Facebook is saying \"we are offering a horseless carriage\" because doing so allows them to avoid honoring the PHR regulations. But the consequences of this are dire. Because Facebook has done this, no other PHR vendor, who actually calls themselves a PHR vendor, can effectively compete against Facebook.</p><p>The market has spoken</p><p>Meeting the FTC definition of a PHR is not the only reason that Facebook Groups should be considered a PHR.</p><p>The Groups product competes against, and dominates traditional PHR systems. There are hundreds of thousands more people (possibly millions) who use Facebook Groups to differentiate care options than those who use all of the other PHR platforms combined.</p><p>Facebook Groups for patient communities is so dominant that any savvy investor would avoid funding an alternative PHR. No amount of features will compete with a patient community that organically develops on a platform that regularly behaves in an anti-competitive manner. Moreover, the fact that Facebook \"helps\" to address healthcare needs makes the product more sticky, which in turn allows Facebook to use its size to unfairly compete in other industries. This is a classic example of monopolistic abuse and this is the reason why we have laws to prevent monopolies.</p><p>Laws that the FTC is in charge of enforcing.</p><p>Why isn't Facebook covered by the FTC as a PHR?</p><p>Myself and other patient community members reported Facebook for violating the PHR breach notification rule . Shortly after we reported this breach, the FTC absolved Facebook of any PHR breach liability through a comprehensive settlement . This was confusing for those in the patient community, because the mechanism for the breach that we reported was not resolved. This means that the issue we discussed in our complaint is an ongoing breach if and only if Facebook's platform is considered a PHR.</p><p>The FTC, in communications, seems to believe that Facebook is not a PHR.</p><p>This essentially serves to make the FTC PHR breach notification pointless, a voluntary regulation. If an organization hosts a product that meets the FTC definition of a PHR and chooses to market this under the label of \"Personal Health Record\" then the FTC will enforce this rule. But if a company markets a product that meets the FTC definition of a PHR but markets the product as a \"Patient Support Group\" then it is, in the eyes of the FTC, not a PHR.</p><p>The irony is that the FTC is also not enforcing its antitrust obligations with Facebook, and in fact facilitates antitrust behavior in Facebook by failing to enforce the PHR breach notification rule. By blessing Facebook's products as \"not a PHR\" it gives Facebook permission to crush other legitimate competitors who have chosen to honor their status of PHR products. Facebook literally uses the fact that they are \"not a PHR\" in order to conduct patient data sharing for \"growth\" in exactly the manner that would be forbidden under the PHR breach notification rule.</p><p>What should the FTC do?</p><p>The current position of the FTC is that the definition of the PHR is \"narrow\" and as result, the FTC has told us in an email exchange that it never actually enforced the rule at all. When FTC personnel speak about the PHR rule publicly they cite examples of FTC enforcement against organizations that have breached healthcare data in some manner, but these are always enforcement of the broad rules that the FTC has against defrauding the public.</p><p>The FTC should explain in detail why the product offered and advertised in the manner of Facebook's Patient Support Groups is NOT a PHR despite its role dominating the PHR industry.</p><p>Further the FTC should either:</p><p>* Explain to the industry that its PHR breach notification rule is optional, based on whether a company chooses to label their product explicitly as a \"Personal Health Record\". This will help other companies to market their \"PHRish\" products as \"horseless carriages\" and enable them to compete effectively against Facebook as a platform.</p><p>* Announce that the FTC considers the Facebook Clinical Groups product to be a PHR and conduct an investigation into potential breaches. This investigation should request evidence from the public for any breaches of health information that have occurred since the recent FTC-Facebook settlement, or breaches that are ongoing since that time.</p><p>I will be submitting this discussion to the FTC as comments on its upcoming rule-making process which is reconsidering the status of the Breach Notification Rule . When replying to this this comment, I request that the FTC extensively clarify answers to the following questions:</p><p>* There was a complaint submitted to the FTC on Facebook's status as a PHR. There was an investigation conducted. The settlement called out handling of some forms of clinical information, but said nothing about Facebook's status as a PHR. It is clear that the FTC was aware that Facebook could be considered in violation of the rule and yet no mention of these issues were discussed in the settlement. Why did the FTC make a settlement which was comprehensive enough that it absolved Facebook of liability for PHR breach notification failures, without clarifying this issue specifically?</p><p>* If the FTC definition of PHR is so narrow that it does not include Facebook's clinical Groups product, how is this different than saying \"organizations that label themselves as not-PHRs are not considered to be PHRs\". This article calls this the \"horseless carriage problem\". Please consider a hypothetical regulation avoider, and then detail how Facebook is different than this hypothetical. For instance, if a company offered an online product that:</p><p>- A. intentionally provided functionality that met the FTC definition of a PHR and</p><p>- B. was marketed as a \"healthcare problem solver\" and</p><p>- C. the product was called \"we-are-not-a-phr.com\",</p><p>- Please explain to us whether this would be considered a PHR under the FTC regulation.</p><p>* And then please detail the difference between this hypothetical</p><p>PHR-which-seeks-to-not-be-regulated and Facebook's actual offerings. From the outside, it seems the reason Facebook is not being treated as a PHR by the FTC is that Facebook has lots of good lawyers, and that those lawyers regard it as inconvenient to be considered a PHR. If the FTC could detail the specific facts about Facebook which make this assumption incorrect, this would help clarify that it is not policy of the FTC to not enforce this rule.</p><p>* The last time we asked the question \"Has the FTC ever enforced the PHR regulation?\" the answer was \"no\". Has there been subsequent enforcement actions that change this answer? Has the PHR breach notification rule ever been enforced?</p><p>* Please do not claim that the FTC cannot discuss this investigation, as the investigation has been completed and Facebook has been deemed not to have any PHR obligations in the resulting settlement. This is no longer an ongoing investigation and as a result, it is not exempt from discussion in the public comment process nor is it exempt from FOIA requests under Exemption 7.</p><p>Addressing these specific concerns through the public comment process will help to inform the PHR market what the actual rules are for the PHR breach notification rule. It will also help to inform Congress about any needed changes to the PHR breach notification rule to ensure that future enforcement has relevance. Lastly, it will help the patient community to understand if FTC regulators have any intention of protecting them from \"Big Tech\" and social media companies, as they develop more and more clinically intrusive product offerings that are outside the \"narrow\" mandate of the FTC to regulate.</p><p>Please consider addressing these concerns clearly and head-on. It seems like the position of the FTC is that the PHR breach notification rule is \"so narrow\" that it simply cannot be enforced practically. This is the standard answer that is frequently given by FTC personnel discussing these issues in public forums. There is no point to a regulation that is not enforced or is not enforceable. In fact, such regulations serve to damage the business operations of those who honor the letter and spirit of the law, because they cannot compete effectively with those who choose to avoid following the rules.</p><p>Most importantly, please recognize the context of this complaint. Facebook has been demonstrated to use its position as a platform to regularly disseminate and magnify clinical misinformation in a way that damages the health and lives of millions. It has repeatedly shown that it does not filter out this kind of mis-information, and that it offers its advertisers the opportunity to profit from this type of mis-information. Facebook makes substantial money by inferring healthcare facts about individuals and then sharing this information with con-artists and snake-oil salesmen who cannot reach the patients who can afford to ask their questions to a physician. That is the issue that is documented in the New York Times article and that is the reality that is encouraged by the FTC's failure to enforce the PHR breach notification rule.</p><p>This is not a hypothetical problem. Thousands of patients have been hurt by Facebook's business model. Which is, from a privacy perspective, exactly the opposite of how a legitimate service should assist patients with online information. We extensively documented how patients were being injured in our complaint and from what we can tell from the outside looking in, that complaint was entirely ignored by the FTC.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>-Fred Trotter</p><p>Healthcare Data Journalist</p><p>* * *</p><p>The proposed rule can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FTC-2020-0045-0001\">https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FTC-2020-0045-0001</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Investors entered the year contending with the possibility of US legislative roll backs and the uncertainty that major economies might slip back into recession due to the unusual longevity of the global recovery. Smart investors looked for innovative ways to expand along the value chain this year, blurring the lines between payers and providers and navigating the entry of new non-healthcare players, including technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, Samsung and Tencent. However, investors continued to latch onto the fundamental forces that have long made healthcare such a compelling investment: an aging population, the rising prevalence of chronic disease, the continuous development of innovative drugs and devices, and a still fragmented and largely inefficient delivery system that is ripe for innovation, disruption and consolidation. </p><p>These are the findings from Bain ...mpany's seventh Global Healthcare Private Equity and Corporate M...eport, released today. Healthcare M...eal value surged in 2017, rising 27 percent to $332 billion, while deal count increased 16 percent. Three megamergers, with a collective value of $126 billion, accounted for more than one-third of that total. This activity is a result of pressure from governments, insurers, employers and consumers to cut costs, while investors pushed for continued top- and bottom-line growth. 'The industry is at a major inflection point, and as a result, we're seeing category leaders consolidate and the silos between sectors starting to blur,' said Dale Stafford, partner and leader of Bain's Americas M...ractice. 'While total corporate deal value in healthcare hasn't quite equaled its 2015 peak, average annual activity over the past four years has been strong, nearly twice the level of the previous four years. This activity is profoundly reshaping the industry.' The global healthcare private equity market soared in 2017, with the total disclosed deal value reaching $42.6 billion, the highest level since 2007. The top 10 deals, with values ranging from $1.3 billion to $5.0 billion, accounted for more than half of that, though deal count increased dramatically, rising to 265 from 206 the year before. 'Healthcare PE investors drove stellar growth this year, despite intense competition from generalist funds, tech-focused funds, institutional investors and corporate acquirers,' said Kara Murphy, partner and co-leader of the firm's Healthcare Private Equity team. 'To keep pace with rising valuations, funds had to get creative with their deal making, taking public companies private and buying businesses from companies ready to divest units that no longer fit with their strategies.' The four largest deals of 2017, collectively valued at more than $15 billion, involved public-to-private transactions, and PE funds were buyers in two corporate carve-outs in the $500 million to $5 billion sweet spot for large PE funds. 'Firms across the sector are feeling the effects of several major disruptive forces, many of which have already transformed other industries,' said Nirad Jain, partner and co-leader of Bain's Healthcare Private Equity team. 'We're just starting to see the ramifications of these trends, which will have a long tail across the industry for years to come. Forward-looking companies are reviewing their investment strategies now to capitalize on the opportunities and mitigate the risks of disruption.' Five Key Disruptions in HealthcareThe Amazon Effect. Amazon roiled healthcare markets in January 2018 when it announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to form a company to deliver healthcare to their employees. Amazon is also reportedly planning to grow its medical supplies business to become a major vendor to US healthcare providers, and Apple, Samsung, Alibaba and Tencent have similarly made recent healthcare investments. Funds should consider these companies' ability to use scale and technological expertise to challenge entrenched healthcare competitors, while keeping in mind that this disruption will occur over the long term. The Digital Revolution. Though the industry has been relatively slow to embrace digitalization, healthcare companies recognize the enormous potential of tools such as advanced analytics, machine learning, smart devices and autonomous robotics. Larger companies are best positioned to take advantage of digital opportunities, while smaller players may risk falling behind. Security remains a primary concern and funds need to be hyper-vigilant about ensuring safeguards to protect confidential patient data. Regulatory Change. From Brexit to the US tax overhaul, to changes in China's medical device distribution system, regulatory changes have swept across major economies, directly affecting the healthcare industry. Funds can minimize potential legislative risk by investing in businesses that don't have direct regulatory or reimbursement exposure, such as contract services organizations, and running a robust commercial due diligence process that allows them to quantify the impact of different outcomes. Consumerism. After years of contending with limited options regarding where, when, how and from whom they got their care, consumers can now pick among a variety of delivery models. These healthcare channels now offer consumers similar qualities they have come to expect when buying other consumer products, including convenience, attentiveness, timeliness, value and price transparency. Funds can take advantage of consumerism by investing in healthcare IT (HCIT) and medtech assets that enable remote care and home care delivery. Personalized Medicine. Personalized medicine integrates a patient's health history, genetic information and individual preferences to develop customized treatments. Investors are looking into companies across the industry that are developing these personalized treatments, including contract research organizations that can test patients for biomarkers and HCIT companies that can integrate and analyze patient data from disparate sources.A look ahead for 2018 Despite valuations at or near record highs, we expect a continued high level of M...ctivity in 2018 as healthcare companies continue to look to M...s a vital component of their growth strategy. Already, we've seen aggressive moves by corporates across healthcare, retail and technology this year, fusing sectors and leading others to make offensive and defensive moves. We expect this and the other trends that drove deal activity in 2017 to continue, and we expect three additional forces to impact the deal landscape in 2018.Evolving laws and regulations. In the US, tax reform will mean lower corporate rates, potentially making healthcare assets attractive to foreign acquirers eager to expand in the world's largest economy. In Europe, new rules affecting medical device manufacturers, particularly the Medical Device Regulation, will force companies to examine their portfolios and evaluate the significant costs of meeting these requirements. Innovation. In the pharma sector, Bain ...mpany expects the development of next-generation platforms such as biosimilars and gene therapy to accelerate. As these technologies mature, they have the potential to disrupt the entire industry, creating buying opportunities while also putting stress on the valuations of traditional companies. Changing nature of total shareholder return (TSR). Rising stock markets have been very generous to the shareholders of public healthcare companies, but that's not something they can count on going forward. According to a Bain analysis, 45 percent of TSR growth at publicly traded global healthcare companies over the past five years came from an expansion of price-to-earnings multiples\u2014that is more than growth from either revenue or earnings.

Welcome back, everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>Thank you so much for joining us. It is Friday, March 10th. Your top stories right now 8:00 on the East Coast. It is Jobs Day, we are 30 minutes away from February Jobs report. Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs that have added to the economy. Peter Kiernan says it's going to be --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PETER KIERNAN, FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNER: A blowout.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO: A blowout. The unemployment rate expected to take down to 4.7 percent. If we get a big number, it's going to impact the markets and obviously we're expecting interest rate hike next week on the 15th. The numbers as soon as they hit the tape on to you. The growing debate over healthcare in America meanwhile, House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>trying is to explain why the current plan should be passed but not all republicans are onboard yet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>PAUL RYAN, </nameText></person>SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here, the time is now, it really comes down to a binary choice, we now have the ability through the budget rules that we have in the senate with our three-pronged approach to actually make good on our word.</p><p>JIM JORDAN, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR OHIO: God bless the speaker but that's not how the legislative process works, right? If you -- if you got an idea that you can get to the floor, bringing the member to the floor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The very latest straight ahead this morning. Meanwhile, markets rallying today ahead of jobs report. Check out this market, we're off of the highs of the morning, nonetheless double-digit move. Dow Industrial is expected to be up about 60 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also higher. NASDAQ up about 14 points, anticipating a very strong jobs number for the month of February. We're checking wages, we are checking the participation rate as well in 30 minutes' time.</p><p>In Europe, the markets are looking like this, also gains across the board, you got the major averages there up between half and two-thirds of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the exception of China, take a look, Nikkei average in japan up 1 1/2 percent. Hang Seng, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Hong Kong, watching the price of oil, all of a sudden markets once again focused on the oil market. Crude prices are recovering a bit this morning. A little stabilization here after closing at lowest level since November yesterday, oil $49.64 a barrel. Pope Francis signalling another possibly change to the church. Why he said he may allow married men to join clergy.</p><p>Plus, remembering the rapper Notorious B.I.G., one congressman using the house floor for a tribute to Big. We will show you the results coming up. And Game of Thrones are dealing the premier of its next season but the announcement had fans going crazier than the mad king. All those stories coming up this morning. And joining to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, Barron's Interim Editor Jack Otter, and the editor online, New York Times best-selling author Peter Kiernan. Great to see you.</p><p>KIERNAN: Great to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations. Got a promotion.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S INTERIM EDITOR: I appreciate. Thanks very much, Maria. We have to make Barron's even better.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Yes. We're going to keep watching that and we will show you the cover of Barron's coming up in the hour.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But first, jobs --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jobs, jobs, jobs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's our number one priority and we are looking at it, we got the numbers coming out in 30 minutes, so stay with us on that. Meanwhile, Capitol Hill this morning is buzzing as well. Republicans are moving forward with the replacement of Obamacare, despite mounting skepticism for the bill. Blake Burman live at White House right now with very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Maria. Good morning to you. And a senior administration official is telling Fox this morning that this is President Trump in his element at the moment. We are told that the president is currently in deal making mode as it relates to the American healthcare act, that senior administration official saying the president is listening to the numbers, all of the numbers here weighing all of his options.</p><p>They remain very confident here at the White House that this thing will eventually get passed. Take a listen to the Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are very confident because of President Trump's leadership and support here in the congress. I'm very confident we'll repeal and replace Obamacare and that will all be done by this spring.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The sales pitch though is very much under way, for example, <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>yesterday, the house speaker was up on the Hill, literally with his jacket off, his shirt rolled up as he gave a PowerPoint presentation, trying to pitch this plan one in which he describes a binary choice essentially take it or leave it repeal and replace Obamacare going forward. However, there are many conservative skeptics here, one of them being Rand Paul who rejected that binary choice label and said last night that the bill as it stands is currently dead on arrival.</p><p>RAND PAUL, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY: The speaker needs to like bring people into the room, conservatives and hear what we want, we are withholding our vote. This is a message for the speaker, we are withholding our vote, we want a seat at the table and it's not a binary choice.</p><p>BURMAN: Back in what that senior administration official is telling Fox this morning, Maria, we are told Mick Mulvaney, the head of OMB is working 20-hour days at this point listening to the opposition, taking in ideas trying to make that work and -- this work and as a senior administration official says, nothing is locked in stone at this morning, that person tells us that everyone will get either something they love, but there will be things that they love and things that they love less. That is how it was phrased to us, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The got to get onboard together with the things that they love and hopefully come out with a bill that they're all behind and the budget of course going to be release next week, Mick Mulvaney working on that and that's on Wednesday. Blake, good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>BURMAN: Bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great reporting as always from Blake Burman at the White House. Well, first Obamacare, then tax reform, senator majority leader Mitch McConnell now suggesting that the White House is August decline for reform may be unrealistic. The Trump administration still sticking to the timeline. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY: I think finishing on tax reform will take longer.</p><p>SPICER: The president's uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman to understand the -- what a good business climate does to job creation. For him this is deeply personal and I think that you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks but we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now, Senior Strategist BGC Partners, Fox News About Contributor Steve Cortes. I don't know, Steve. Good morning to you. I don't --</p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm feeling like the administration and now Mitch McConnell are trying to manage expectations. Take the expectations down in terms of tax reform, this market up 14 percent since Election Day, if we don't see tax reform by august, what happens?</p><p>CORTES: If we don't see it by august, I think we're going to see a serious correction not just in the market but in the real economy and that's why it just simply can't happen and I don't want to hear naysaying from somebody like Mitch McConnell, you know, you were just talking about NFL free agency, well, the American voter, gave the republicans the ball on the one-yard line first and goal by giving us both houses of congress and the Oval Office and they are demanding as they should, they're demanding outcomes that they voted for, including a repeal and replace and including tax reform.</p><p>So I believe the president is going to be successful, our deal maker in chief, he is really on a charm offensive, he's having lunches and dinners and bowling, he's the charmer in chief lately too, he's going to twist arms, he's going to persuade people, we're going to get this done on the White House this timeline and we have to for the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll see it, Dagen, I mean, he's going to through to sell that Obamacare plan this weekend, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In Kentucky. You're going to Kentucky.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly. Where -- by the way, you won six more counties than Rand Paul who's opposed to GOP plan coming out of the house. But Steve, I want to bring this, it's not a complete repeal which is what some conservatives have a problem with. That it still requires government handouts for people to buy insurance whether you -- so they're not called subsidies, they're called tax credits but refundable tax credits, that it's still -- you've got all the senators and governors who accepted this giant Medicaid expansion, fussing about that going away in 2020 and the conservatives want it gone even sooner than that. So how do you bring those two sides together?</p><p>CORTES: Right. No. And Dagen, look, you make great points, I tend to lean pretty libertarian, so this is an imperfect bill to be sure but I don't think we should make the perfect the enemy of the good. And what we are trying do -- what the administration is trying to do here I think is satisfy both house conservatives among republicans and then senate liberals among republicans, and so to thread that needle is incredibly difficult but I think this bill does and by the way, one thing I will push back at, a tax credit is not a subsidy. When you pay money to the government and get some it back, that is not a subsidy. It is for people who don't pay taxes. But it is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: If it's refundable and in this bill, it's refundable, now a small percentage of people will get it but when you don't pay taxes and you get money back through a tax credit, that's a handout, that's a subsidy.</p><p>CORTES: Right. For those people but for most of us who pay taxes, it's not a subsidy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to leave there but I know you're sticking with us for our Jobs in America Special this hour, Steve. Thank you. Stay right there.</p><p>CORTES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Still ahead. Could we see soon see a seismic shift for Catholics, why Pope Francis says the church may no longer be married to one longstanding tradition.</p><p>Then we are less than 20 minutes away from the first full jobs report for the month of Trump's presidency. We're breaking down what you need to know about jobs, markets off of the highs right now going into the number. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Pope Francis signaling that he is open to married men becoming priests. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So this big news in the catholic community, Maria. In an interview with German newspaper, Pope Francis says the church must study whether it's possible ordain married men to become catholic priests as the church is facing a shortage of them in remote communities. The pope says the option would allow men who are already married to be ordained but single men who already are priests would not be allowed to marry after the fact. We will keep you posted.</p><p>And other headlines this morning. Hip hop has made it to the house of representatives. Brooklyn Congressman Hakeem Jeffries paid tribute to the late rapper Biggie Smalls also known, I was just told as Notorious B.I.G. because the whole crew has been on me about this. He was killed 20 years ago yesterday, well, Jeffries recited the lyrics to the 1994 song Juicy, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK: It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the limousine, hanging pictures on my wall, every Saturday rap attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, Biggie Smalls rose in streets of New York to be one of the successful rap artist in history. He was killed in drive-by shooting in Los Angeles back in 1997. And finally, for your Game of Thrones fans, we now know that season seven of the hit series is going to start on July 16. Mark your calendars, HBO making the announcement during a 15-minute long segment on Facebook live. And a very cool twist of marketing guys, the news was hidden in a giant block of ice and then viewers had to comment fire to melt the ice. Games of Thrones also releasing an official teaser that included \"from past seasons.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMILIA CLARKE, DAENERYS TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES: I know what my father was, what he did. I know the Mad King earned his name</p><p>DAVID RINTOUL, KING AERYS II TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES: Burn them all.</p><p>MARK ADDY, ROBERT BARATHEON IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES: Kill ever Targaryen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: And for all the drama, the video actually had a few stops and starts of the ice gimmick by the way, it lasted longer than an average episode of Game of Thrones which we hear, Maria. Pretty long. Anyway, people are obsessed with the show. I'm very excited about this whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Everybody really is, you're right. Cheryl, thank you. Up next, the February Jobs report moments away. What you need to know ahead of the release. What it will mean for markets and your opportunities. Stay with us. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are just under 10 minutes away from February Jobs report. Here is what we're expecting. Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to economy in the last month in February with the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent. We want to bring in our all-stars right now, the founder of capitalistpig.com, Jonathan Hoenig is with us, the host of Making Money With Charles Payne, Charles Payne with us, and, of course, Steve Cortes is also with us along with our great panel here, Charles good to see you.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, MAKING MONEY WITH CHARLES PAYNE HOST: You too. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good job, Charles. You want to do any rapping before we start?</p><p>PAYNE: I think I get it out of my system.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He was rapping, he just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Give us one.</p><p>PAYNE: We got to do it? OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Go.</p><p>PAYNE: It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the limousine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Thank you for that. Now --</p><p>PAYNE: No, really. That was -- that was a very uplifting song. The guy was really happy that he made it out of the hood and he took his friends with him. That's a beautiful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Awesome. Tell us about jobs now, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: I think a lot of people going to make it out of the hood in February according to jobs report --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think it's going to be a blowout?</p><p>PAYNE: Let me tell you guys. I think we under reported that ADP report and I know that ADP is not BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics but the goods producing part of that, the headline hogged everything, 298,000, that wasn't the story. 106 goods producing jobs is the highest number ever for ADP report going back to 2002. That's the highest they've ever seen. 66,000 constructing jobs, over 8,000 money jobs, money jobs pay $28 an hour, these are good paying jobs and by the way, this is the epicenter of the financial crisis, the great recession, hit these people harder than anything else. How did Donald Trump win Pennsylvania, how did he win Wisconsin? Was these folks didn't have a job, it felt like everyone ignored their pleas and now a lot of them are getting jobs now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So money is finally breaking out.</p><p>PAYNE: Money had a good number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one area we're going to watch with this -- with this jobs report. Let me quickly get your take on snap because it went public over a week ago, it was obviously a rocky debut although going into it, it was priced 17, Peter, it opened to 24. You said sell it when?</p><p>KIERNAN: I sold it 25 on air on Fox Business News.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nice. Sweet.</p><p>KIERNAN: The reason was if you look at 8 of the last 10 big tech IPOs, they all in one year traded below the IPO price. So people are watching, do not chase these deals, do not, they will always --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can I sell it here if I own it at 22.71?</p><p>KIERNAN: You know, I'm not in love with this company right now, I think it is priced at about 35 billion market cap, something like that, 30 billion.</p><p>PAYNE: Just to piggyback on that, the top 20 if you go back in the last several years, peak at 38 days on average and then go down for four months straight.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>PAYNE: That's the stat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that was the trend?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jack Otter, Barron's called it, you said to sell it, you told leaders.</p><p>OTTER: Barron's was negative on it, I mean, it was 93 times sales. Even if this year optimistic sales reach a billion dollars, that's still 34 times sales, it's just you the too expensive. And I always hate to bet against the technology company that's young, that's exciting, 158 million excited users including my 13-year-old daughter who loves it, but you got to wonder if Snap can really go in direction of Facebook which has such huge broad base, Twitter might be a better comparison, you know, we all use Twitter but didn't catch on the way that some other social media companies do and we're coming out with a story tomorrow where we say maybe GoPro is actually the better example and that is not been a good stock. I actually left my GoPro.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're comparing -- you're comparing Snap to GoPro.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's check out cover of Barron's. Let's reveal. Give us big reveal for the cover this weekend because you got a story in the ETFs.</p><p>OTTER: Yes. We got some of the smartest people in ETFland. In fact, three of those people control 80 percent of the assets on the management in the ETFland, so we're asking them what's next? It's a very interesting financial device. I mean, it gets kind of geek, so, Dagen will love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was the first financial reporter to cover ETF 20 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. It's been 20 years, huh?</p><p>OTTER: Nearly 20 years old.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>OTTER: But for instance --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was our first words.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OTTER: In a big day in the market, people are buying ETFs all day. Well, toward the end -- towards 4:00 then the market needs to start adjusting for all those buys, so people start loading, they have to -- they have to rebalance, so they start loading up on stocks on a bad day it goes the other way. So it really changes the dynamics of the market and that's going to be a story going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jump in here.</p><p>KIERNAN: Yes. I think ETFs are going to be worth watching because in market interruptions, they do not perform -- excuse me, anywhere like stocks because there isn't sort of dynamic market making underneath. And I think this is one is the -- I think Achilles heels of the ETF.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The big story Barron's this weekend that we'll be watching. We got the February Jobs report right after break. We're not going to miss it, we got all details next. Back in a moment. Stay with us, markets rallying going into that jobs report.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK , TENNIS CHANNEL'S COURT REPORT HOST: Hey guys. Tennis Channel Jonathan Novack with another special court report for Fox Business. The temperatures hit the 80s in Coachella Valley on day two of the 2017 BNP Paribas Open. And Thursday I saw one young American move on to second round for th3e biggest win of his career so far.</p><p>Bjorn Fratangelo is a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he's 23-year-old showed his class as he dispatched Bernard Tomic in straight sets. Fratangelo closing out the victory just over an hour, Bernard Tomic's fourth opening round loss since the Aussie Open.</p><p>Lauren Davis started the year by lifting the trophy in Auckland and she continued that kind of form with an excellent comeback against Victoria Golubic. Up next, Anastasija Sevastova. And don't forget, PC Plus in tennis channel live coverage from Indian Wells, continues Friday 1:00 pm Eastern. I'm Jonathan Novack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday everybody. Thank you so much joining us. It is Friday, March 10th. Breaking news, we are moments away from February Jobs report, here is what we are looking for. Economists looking for 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of February. The unemployment rate expected to tick down to 4.7 percent. Markets are rallying going into the report, it's just two minutes away. Take a look where markets are, now at highs of the morning, up 76 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Jonathan Hoenig is with us this morning. Give us your thoughts ahead of this number. We all spoke with the panel already and people are looking for a very strong number. What about you?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER OF CAPITALISTPIG.COM: Yes. I think you'll see a beat, Maria, you saw in the ADP number yesterday but ironically a beat for jobs will be a bad thing for the economy, you know, jobs come less, we talked for eight years about where are jobs, the jobs are finally here, I think you see --- buy rumor, sell the fact and a good jobs number actually precipitates a decline and a correction for stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know about that, Dagen. Yesterday you made such an important point because you said, look if we get a good jobs number, that's a vote of confidence, things are getting better.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely. And watch the government jobs because remember Donald Trump when he became president froze federal hiring in late January, this is the first time that's going to show up in this report.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. They'll be down. They've been down but I always still disagree with Jonathan in the sense that, you know, let's get it going, you know, 300, 400, 500,000 jobs, you know, I think good is a relative term these days and a stronger than expected number is still not kind of good jobs number I think that will be counterintuitive to the market or the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I used to do this a minute before number but you put a three handle on it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN: I think we're going to have a good show and I don't it's going to take the market down. I really think that what we're beginning to see is a second leg, we have the Trump rally and now we have the proof in the pudding part of the rally and if we get good jobs, I think we're going to see the market continue to grow here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Guys, we're all talking about jobs, what about wages, OK? Steve Cortes, do you think we're going to see any movement up 2.8 percent? It's what people are looking for year over year wages.</p><p>CORTES: I do. Maria, wages are finally moving. I gave up pessimism for lent, so I'm going to tell you that we're going to have a blowout number. I think 300 is possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do, so you are with Peter as well -- as well say that. And then there's the participation rate guys, real quick.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was up 2/10 of a percent, in January at 52.9, let's hope it goes up.</p><p>CORTES: Indeed. I want to see wages go up because if we get enough -- people hired eventually they're going to have to start paying them more unless participation --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. The number is on top. It's going to be out in a moment. Let's get to Peter Barnes, he's at the Labor Department right now with the news. Peter Barnes, over to you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: 235,000 new non-foreign payroll jobs in February, Maria. 235,000 new payroll jobs last month. The first full month of the Trump administration and above analysts' expectations. The unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent from 4.8, as more than 300,000 people returned to the labor force last month. And that sent the labor force participation rate, up to 63 percent, the highest level in a year. Hourly wages rose by 0.2 percent last month, to $26.09 an hour. Year over year, wages are up 2.8 percent.</p><p>Construction had a great month last month, up 58,000 jobs, the biggest monthly increase since March 2007. But likely due in part to the warm weather we've been having around the country, manufacturing jumped 28,000 jobs. But retail down, 26,000, likely post-holiday cuts. Education and health, up 62,000. Business and professional services, plus 27. Leisure and hospitality, plus 26. And government, added 8,000 jobs mostly at the local level. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Peter, thank you. We're seeing the markets react positively. It is better than expected, but we - is it fair to say it was better than expected but that was expected? Peter, what do you think?</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, GOLDMAN SACHS FORMER PARTNER: I think it was one of those in line, I think where you're going to see nice fallout is. This really clears any underbrush away from a rate hike next week, that's going to happen. And when that happens, I think you're going to see a very nice move in the financials. They've moved very nicely so far, but this - if particularly, if the fed wants to do four rate hikes this year, which they could potentially do. That could put billions of dollars of earnings into banks.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRONS.COM EDITOR: We all groan when the number came out because we were really expecting them to over deliver -</p><p>BARTIROMO: I didn't.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I did not groan.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: You said 2:30? You won the bed, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you did.</p><p>OTTER: Good solid number, it's only bad if you are judging by ADP. And you think, oh my gosh! We're going to have some incredible - but this is a solid number and, you know, I know Charles wants to see as 4, 500. But we are albeit a very slow, this point of recovery, we are eight years into recovery. So -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: That's the number that I think would - that will prove Jonathan's theory. In other words, 235 beats the estimates but this is not the kind of counterintuitive number that would point to some kind of, end of the - you know, the business cycle, traditionally has been blown out of whack. This is, you know, from all of different things that have done it's not what it used to be. You can go ahead, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALIST PIG HEDGE FUND FOUNDING MEMBER: Well, in terms of number, it's outstanding. I'm happy to see that as you said, it's been a long time coming upwards of eight years. And the fact that this has gone under Donald Trump's first month in office, is also a bull shine. But look at the underpinnings of the market, more new lows, than new highs yesterday. And bonds just across the board, you can then take it out to woodshed. I think despite the fact the numbers are good, some of the dynamic underpinnings of the stocks themselves give reason - one reason for some worry at this point.</p><p>OTTER: Yes, I would add to that, Jonathan, the - I mean, excuse me, the small-cap stocks rise into thousand and is down about 3.8 percent, copper is down. So, not everything is bullish out there. I mean, as we all look at the recent performance of the S&amp;P 500 which has been great. But there are a few signs, that maybe we're getting a little too blurb.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what about mining, Charles? Do we know, in terms of -</p><p>PAYNE: I didn't see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I didn't hear Peter discussed mining.</p><p>PAYNE: We've got construction and manufacturing but, those are two numbers though that were almost identical to ADP, right. 66,000 ADP, 58,000 construction. Yes, I know it was warmer, but we've had warm patches over the last several years that haven't created this kind of construction. And we need them for a couple reasons, think about dearth of homes - the man is out there. Month supply is at so - it's such a low point. If we get that going again - they're all connected. I think this is a phenomenal number. I love the idea that 300,000 people came back to the workforce.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He thanked you. Thank you. Can get a halleluiah?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Participation is the most important thing. The unemployment rate fell, despite the fact that 300,000 people started looking for work. That means that they found work. That they came back. A highest labor participation rate in a year.</p><p>PAYNE: And we need people to believe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because that's, that's the optimistic sign. Can go out there and get a job? Yes, you can. Amen.</p><p>KIERNAN: Well, one of the things that's also happening is we're a long away from the peak labor participation rate of 67 percent. But were trending upward, and that is a very important number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 63 percent participation rate. Steve Cortes, go ahead.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And Maria, listen, I think that is by far the most important news this morning - this participation rate. And I'm so glad that they're also connected to construction and mining. Those are businesses which tends to be dominating - the workers are mostly male. If you look at workforce participation, it's been trending down for everybody which is a terrible thing for men, under the Obama administration it hit a recorded low.</p><p>So, that is great news, that construction and mining are coming back, to life. It's huge for men, it's huge for our economy. So, to get the participation rate up, and still keep jobless rate down, that is just a massive win for the economy. So, I know we have some naysayers on the panel, I think the stock market's going to go manically higher. I think growth going to accelerate in a really material way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Charles, look at these wages numbers, the brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by steady wage growth. Hourly earnings rising six cents, that's 2/10th of a percent. You want more, obviously, but it's in the right direction. 2.8 percent, year over year.</p><p>PAYNE: It's in the right direction. And also, the skills aspect of this, you know, earlier in the week LinkedIn did their workforce report. And they talked about the skills gap, and we talk about it always associated with technology. But oil-well drillers and people who can, you know, work on construction projects. When we started to get all of those things filled in, but what do you need? I think these numbers will even take off even more than they have already.</p><p>KIERNAN: I like to pick up on that point, because there are a lot of people who are focused on the retail piece of equation, and there are a lot of jobs that are being lost in retail. JC Penney, alone says they're going to lay off 5500 people, but there's a balance to that. And that is, that people like Amazon are saying, this year we're going to create 100,000 new jobs. So, what happens is, yes, so as retail jobs are disappearing, but they're showing up somewhere else in the economic pile. And that's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how about construction? Jonathan Hoenig, go ahead. Jump in, Jonathan.</p><p>HOENIG: It's - it's buy the rumor, and sell fact. You know, for eight years, people say, well the stock market's going up but I don't know, we don't have jobs yet. We don't have jobs yet. Look, now we've got jobs job. The job numbers great. I'm applauding that. I'm just wondering if perhaps now the market has gotten a little bit ahead of itself in that sense. Our guest mentioned the - some of the retailers are getting just absolutely taken to woodshed. Real estate, that's related to the retailers are getting killed right now, leverage loans, convertible bonds. So, I'm not saying don't be enthusiastic about this great number, remember to moment take a moment and think. Is the good news now already out? Is this a good number, with the markets were anticipating 4.3 percent ago, on the Dow?</p><p>BARTIROMO: See, I think it's all about - I think it's all about policy out of Washington. Dagen, there's a bit under this market come on, until they blow it on tax reform.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely, and I'll point out with wages - with wages growing at 2.8 percent. That's solid. But it's not enough to really start worrying about inflation picking up. That keeps the fed at bay potentially - when you talk about four interest rate hikes? Maybe, it is two. But again, that is the kind of not too hot, not to cold.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Goldilocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just right wage number.</p><p>OTTER: One important point that you're - you have to use the word inflation, but as what you're referring to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I said it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you just said it.</p><p>OTTER: So, I think that's very important. We used to think that inflation is bad thing, but you're right, inflation is a good thing. And around the world, you're actually seeing a little bit of less concern about deflation. So, we're talking about draggy earlier, getting a teeny bit hawkish. I mean, it's still very loose over there, but he's saying, OK, maybe the deflation is not as big a worry as we thought. And globally, that's what we need.</p><p>PAYNE: It's so funny now, because for a long-time inflation was a four-letter word, right? I also tell people, well, are you happy when your paycheck is inflated?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, maybe.</p><p>PAYNE: If the value of the house inflated? You know, we want some inflation, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out, because we're watching the Futures. The Dow would need to gains 147 1/2 points today, to be in positive territory. Because right now, it's going to snap a four-week winning streak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, you were talking about the sell-off and face small cap stocks in the last week?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. The rest is down six sessions in a row, the last time it was up was the day after President Trump's speech, which kind of tells, you know. I think that group, though, is much more sensitive to President Trump, and the nuances of President Trump because it's a lot of American centric businesses, that will do very we'll. And it's almost a barometer actually, of the presidency to a degree.</p><p>KIERNAN: And one of the things you and I debated and discussed over the years is, what happens to the high dividend paying risk free or risk less stocks in this market? They've - initially, we're not doing very well, now people are starting to drift back in the utilities. To me, that follows like the bottom mark of it, people are a little unsure where're the market's going now. I feel like this is a pause -</p><p>PAYNE: Some of that comes back to what Maria just said with the - with respect to taxes. And I think also - let's face it, a lot of people frustrated on investment world that Obamacare had to come before anything else, thinking that some of these other things could have been done pretty easily.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're pulling it back in reforming it, repealing it, whatever you want to call it. It is a tax cut. It's a tax cut on investors.</p><p>PAYNE: It's a $600 billion tax cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big tax cut.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's not the kind of tax cut though, that's going to get a company to invest in a new building project or get the average person watching this show to go out and spend more money, or even start to leverage credit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the whole border adjustment tax was like a buzz kill. I mean, we didn't hear anything about the border adjustment tax during the campaign. And all of the sudden, now we're talking about raising revenue while cutting taxes. Just cut the taxes.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. I hope that fades away.</p><p>HOENIG: There's going to be tremendous surprises, Maria. Just look at something like oil, which is expected to be a major beneficiary, of course, of the Trump administration. Oil stocks are almost at 52-week lows across the board. Ironically, it's the green energy stocks that are starting to outperform. This is going to be - is this going to end up not as otherwise would imagine? The market's going to surprise us, I think even in the face of these excellent job numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you mean? So, you think - you're expecting a sell-off in stocks? You'd be selling into this rally, today?</p><p>HOENIG: I think you have to be very hesitant buying, Maria, once the good news is out. Again, buy the rumor, sell the fact - the time to buy stocks I think is when job numbers weren't terrible. And people saying, I'm not going to buy until the - we're starting to get these numbers now. And the fact that stocks are now starting to do poorly, again, more new 52-week lows and highs, just tells me that the internals are weak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, Steve Cortes, you on the other side of that trade?</p><p>CORTES: I sure am, Maria. And you know, listen, I think you're right that the biggest risk is Washington, D.C., out there, if Washington doesn't deliver. But I guess I would say this, you know, as somebody who campaigned very hard for then candidate Trump, and now President Trump, I believe staking his presidency on this legislative agenda on repeal the replace, and more importantly, on tax reform. And because of that, I think he's going to press members of Congress like you can't believe, and they do not want to go back to their districts - in Republican districts and Republican leaning states, where President Trump is incredibly popular. They don't want to go back and face voters and explain, why they were the obstacle to this agenda that they voted for? So, it's not going to happen -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, why did Mitch McConnell say what he said? I mean, Mitch McConnell, you know.</p><p>CORTES: You know, both of these Kentucky Senators are really annoying me lately, they're both naysayers. By the way, Mitch McConnell, has often been, I would say, unhelpful at times to the President. But even he, I think will have to toe the line eventually - again, he and Rand Paul, I don't think want to go back to Kentucky whenever they're up for reelection, and explain why they impeded President Trump and the will of the American people, by the way. So, we're going to get - it's going to be ugly the headlines, there's a lot of consternation back-and-forth. I think it is why the market's pausing, right now, I really do. It's unrest, and uncertainty about Washington, but once we do get these -</p><p>PAYNE: Let me just say one thing of that, Steve. What if they go back to these voters a few years from now? And they say, why did you guys pass Obamacare 2.0? Nothing changed for me, from what you guys promised. I don't know if they want to face that as well, that's the other side of their political risk here, for them.</p><p>CORTES: Sure, but plenty is changing is changing this bill. I mean, it's not fair, I think, to call it 2.0. But I also think more importantly, this is the step to the even bigger reform, which is tax reform. And once we get tax reform and this economy starts really growing again. Then they won't have to explain anything to their voters, they'll just be high fiving them and accepting their support.</p><p>KIERNAN: One of the areas where Mitch McConnell was right though, is that tax reform is hard. It's easy to underestimate the complexity of the task, and I do think an August deadline is ambitious. I thought it was ambitious when Trump said it as President, I thought it was ambitious when the Treasury Secretary said it. And what we don't see a lot of on Senate, particularly, is multitasking. And we're asking to do two things, simultaneously, that are big complicated, vexing, and have to be sold back home as well.</p><p>OTTER: You know, a lot of people were critical of Obama, not just for Obamacare, but for the fact that he put that first. And they said, we got a serious - we're coming out of a pretty big recession here, let's worry about that and then do health care. And we could see that same criticism of Republicans now. I know they say, in order to do the tax bill, we need fix Obamacare first. But, you know, I kind of wish they've gone straight to Obamacare, because you're right, it is incredibly complicated. How long did it take Reagan?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's mean taxes.</p><p>OTTER: It's mean taxes. How long did take to get the Reagan -</p><p>PAYNE: But you could get lower rates quicker than you could get a full-fledged -</p><p>OTTER: And I'd love to see growth. That's the good Trump, and market wants that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're going to spend your political capital? Give the American people their capital back. Let them keep more if their income. Do it immediately, and make it retroactive to January 1. Do you know how much - people would have backed off, and be like, OK, now you can deal with reforming Obamacare.</p><p>PAYNE: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm perfectly happy. I'm going to go buy a new ATV.</p><p>KIERNAN: And you to prove to people that you're a good guy, that you can get things done, that you can make your deals - and by the way, everyone is going home saying, I brought you home tax reform. And with that, winning can take on the tough stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But instead they work GOP, and the House.</p><p>CORTES: Let's do it then! It's all talk, let's do it!</p><p>BARTIROMO: Guys, does anybody -</p><p>CORTES: They keep talking about tax cut, let's do it Donald Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've been saying that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have been.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've been saying that, instead we got the border adjustment tax shoved in there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some tax to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years. Does anybody want to touch on retail here, Charles? Down 26,000 jobs in retail. That's one of the few areas where we actually showed job cuts. We got strength in construction up 50,000, strength leisure hospitality, strength in manufacturing, strength in government.</p><p>PAYNE: It's the long - everyone just talked about the death of brick and mortar, you know. And as I already mentioned here, it's been off-set to a degree by Amazon. But even these retailers doing well, children's place this week, one of the biggest winners in the market - two days ago, was up 20 percent in one day. They're doing well because of last two years, they've closed 142 non-performing stores. So, even if these stores that are doing well, relatively speaking, are closing stores, are firing people, so, you know, that's just something that's not going to exist.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some of this could be seasonal adjustment from the Labor Department, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In retail?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. In the post-holiday months. That, it could be some of that. You could see some give back in the next month's jobs' report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a pretty steep decline.</p><p>KIERNAN: And Texas had a very tough month last month on their oil patch. And so, there are punch on these things that I think are little moments in the sun, where I we can see them come back. And I think jobs are going to continue to grow throughout the rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Hot morning here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we're going to talk a short break. More on the February jobs report, after this short break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the February jobs report just out. As we've been reporting, the economy created 235,000 jobs, in the month of February, beating economists' expectations. The unemployment rate ticked down slightly to 4.7 percent. Also expected, the labor force participation rate; this was highlight came in at 63 percent. That was better than expected. I want to bring in the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney now, joining us with his thoughts. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST: Good morning, Maria. I will say this. I think it was a solid report; not spectacular, not a blowout, but I think it marks what I'm going to call the beginning of the Trump expansion. Call me crazy but I think that's where it's at. Now, you're going to get folks on the left who say this was a solid jobs' report result of President Obama's policy or Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve. That's nonsense.</p><p>The change in the mood of the country towards more optimism, towards more growth, towards more confidence, that started November the 8th with the election. So, I'm calling this the beginnings of the Trump expansion. 58,000 new construction jobs, what was it? 28,000 manufacturing, those are good well paid-jobs. And I think they're' going to expand that front in the future. That's where I'm coming from.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Wait till we get an infrastructure program, right? I mean, those construction jobs are going to benefit even more.</p><p>VARNEY: Absolutely. And that infrastructure program will come. I think it's got bi-partisan support, not sure how you pay for it. But it's got bipartisan support. Something on that front is going to get done this year. That is very good news for those high paid construction jobs and manufacturing, too, positive.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Sir, what do you think about your buddy though, Elon Musk? He might get a bit chunk of that infrastructure for the hyper loop.</p><p>VARNEY: My buddy, Elon Musk. Well, said with tongue-in-cheek there, Charles? I do declare. I'm not wild about companies that live on government subsidies especially green subsidies. But look, if this guy can come up with a way of making a battery that stores enormous amounts of electricity, then you are on to a winner. That's my story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let me just point something out. All the people who drive Teslas don't pay for our infrastructure now because they don't pay any gas taxes. They're plugging in and refuelling that way, and so they're basically getting a free ride on the back of all the other taxpayers in this country. So that -- it shocks me a little bit too.</p><p>VARNEY: It's -- you are pointing the finger towards real outrage here. I think Tesla should be banned. OK, I'm joking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>VARNEY: Just warming it up.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Well, you know, what do you think about retail? Retail was down 26,000. Does that matter or do you think that's just a fluke because of the holidays.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh no. I think that, that really reinforces our story. We keep talking about the retail ice age. They're having a very hard time. The bricks-and-mortar people meeting the challenge of online selling and this down , 26,000 -- 26,000 retail jobs, that's a big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: That tells the story. I wouldn't want to be a mall operator right now. I wouldn't want to be buying real estate in a shopping mall in this day and age. I think they got a real problem here.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Yes, that's a good point. It's really online that's winning here. Hey Stu, are you tired of winning it?</p><p>VARNEY: You mean in the ratings? I'll never get tired of winning.</p><p>BARTIMORO: You'll never get tired of that. Now that we have Donald Trump, you're going to get so sick of winning. We're winning, right. OK. Stu, we'll see you in about --</p><p>VARNEY: We'll you give an opportunity, Maria. I thought I'd grab it with both hands.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Yes, I love it. That was a lob. That's what they call a lob, Stu. Congratulations to you and Fox Business Network. We got the All-Stars right here.</p><p>PAYNE: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations everybody .</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, thank you, you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For beating the competition. Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes. Join \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" top of the hour. Steve, final thoughts from you and Jonathan. Your take on today's number, final word.</p><p>CORTES: You know, final thoughts, Maria. Between Fox Business and the ratings and Trump and the White House, and the stock market, I'm not tired of winning yet but we might get there soon. I think this is a fantastic report. I really do, particularly the participation. Too many people had given up on America, had given up on life really, in a lot of ways. Not to be too philosophical but we need them back in the workforce and they're coming back and that's great news.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Jonathan Hoenig.</p><p>HOENIG: There's an unlimited amount of wealth and jobs that can be created, Maria. It's freedom that's needed to make that happen. So long as the government and you're right, Washington, is very much at the center of Wall Street these days. As so long as the government can keep this trend going, lower taxes, lower regulation, more individual and economic freedom, I think 200,000 new jobs is just the start.</p><p>BARTIMORO: All right we will leave it there. Steve Cortes, Jonathan Hoenig, good to see you both. Gentlemen, have a good weekend. We got the best team in business. After this short break, right here at the panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Welcome back, final thoughts from our All-Star Panel. We got markets on fire this morning on the hills. It has been better than expected jobs report. Financials leading the rally at Peter Kiernan, you called it.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, ENTREPENEUR: I have to say financers are incredibly well positioned and what's going to be exciting to see is whether small businesses really take this opportunity to hire, to expand and whether the big company starts parting some of that cash and the best thing in the long term. Property plan equipment and expanding.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Yes, I want to get Charles' take on this though. Because Charles, you know how to make money in this market. Would you think it's overvalued at this point?</p><p>PAYNE: I think there are a lot of individual names that are overvalued. When you see companies miss, they're taken out to the woodshed pretty good so that's where your risk is. And this is by no means a dart throwing kind of rally. I think that people need to understand too, a handful of names have been overwhelmingly responsible for the move, right? Because of the way the Dow forensics is weighted. But you know, we've got to think longer term. And this motion of occasional dips, you know yesterday, we talked about the eight-year anniversary of the market.</p><p>Think about the longest streak ever, right. It went from '87 to 2000. Well, guess what? From '82 to '87, there was also a rally. So you can almost argue from '82 to 2000, with a three month blip, could you live with that? Hell yes, if you were in the market. So, it's going to happen. I think we don't want to get too fixated on the market occasionally pulling back. Think longer term.</p><p>BARTIMORO: Yes.</p><p>JACK OTTER, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: It's important for investors to understand the good news does not always mean good start. The good news was baked in a long time ago, Jonathan Hoenig was making that point. And so we have to be careful of buy the rumor and sell the news, and especially if maybe the market is too optimistic about tax breaks, about deregulation and we get bogged down in Obamacare or bore taxes.</p><p>BARTIMORO: What do you mean by good news was baked in? I mean, you - how many people we're like Trump's going to win and the markets are going to sell off? Well, what is baked in?</p><p>OTTER: Well, because as soon as he was elected, suddenly the market took off. And we've been - I watch the market.</p><p>PAYNE: The $3 trillion in additional market evaluation.</p><p>OTTER: Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIMORO: The anticipation about policy.</p><p>OTTER: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Materializing so far into reality. We're seeing sentiment materialize into reality as long as you have that, that's the ultimate support.</p><p>OTTER: How long to keep up?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to point out in terms of optimism. 300,000 people re-entered the work force. The unemployment rate falls which means that people found work. The labor participation rate continues to go up, that is your Trump optimism right there.</p><p>BARTIMORO: How about wages, Dagen? I mean, you got wages up 2.8 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, and not hot enough to make people worry about the Federal Reserve.</p><p>KIERNAN: And I think the central point, in addition, there's room to grow. We still have a lot of room to grow to get where we've been before and I think that's great news for this economy.</p><p>BARTIMORO: And then there's trade this Sunday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I'm going to be speaking with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. He is my special guest to talk about trade and how that fits into all of this. That's one of the worries out there. We'll talk with the Wilbur Ross, joining me on the Fox News Channel. Thanks, everybody.</p><p>KIERNAN: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a great weekend. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now. Stuart, take it away</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017031003cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N2B-8G31-JB20-G1G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 10, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp; SECURITIES DEALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Obamacare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Game of Thrones</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Notorious B.I.G.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GOP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biggie Smalls</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Juicy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Word Up!

Takedowns so far this year have involved medical clinics, home health care services, and shell companies that submitted fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims for tens of millions of dollars at a time, Attorney General <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch, </nameText></person>Department of Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Sylvia Mathews Burwell, </nameText></person>and other US officials announced Wednesday. In one example, three individuals were indicted for operating clinics that gave drug addicts prescriptions for controlled substances and narcotics and then billed Medicare for $36 million in fraudulent claims for services that were never provided. \u2014 BLOOMBERG</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FAST FOOD</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jimmy John's to stop noncompete clauses in New York</p><h>BODY</h><p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says the Jimmy John's sandwich chain has agreed to stop including noncompete agreements in hiring packets used for low-wage workers. Schneiderman said Wednesday that such agreements \"bully\" workers into staying under threat of being sued, and companies should stop using them for minimum-wage employees. The sample noncompete agreements Jimmy John's sent its franchisees prevented employees from working for any nearby business that gets at least 10 percent of its sales from sandwiches for two years after they left. Jimmy John's said it assured Schneiderman's office it wouldn't support the enforcement of a franchisee's noncompete agreement against a worker. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>SHARING ECONOMY</p><p>Chicago passes measures to address Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb</p><p>After weeks of debate, Chicago's City Council approved compromise measures Wednesday placing at least some restrictions on two ventures at the core of the sharing economy, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and short-term rental companies like Airbnb. In a separate measure, aldermen approved licensing regulations for ride-hailing services after the member who crafted the rules dropped an insistence on fingerprint background checks. The mayor's office said the regulations on short-term rentals are the first in the nation to require companies to regularly share data on rental listings with the city so it can check if they comply with the law. It also imposes new licensing fees to fund enforcement of the rules and services for the homeless, and sets up a complaint hot line. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>FAST FOOD</p><p>Burger King to sell mac and cheese sticks covered in Cheetos</p><p>Burger King, the restaurant chain backed by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett, will begin selling deep-fried sticks of macaroni and cheese encrusted in Cheetos-flavored breading, part of a trend toward blending fast food with well-known snack brands. The new product, called Mac 'n Cheetos, emerged from a partnership with PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay, the snack empire that owns Cheetos, Doritos, Ruffles, and other chips. The move mimics the strategy of Yum Brands Inc.'s Taco Bell, which introduced a taco with a Doritos shell in 2012. Mac 'n Cheetos will be sold for about eight weeks or until supplies run out, said Burger King. \u2014 BLOOMBERG</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Sales in May strongest in nearly a decade</p><p>Americans snapped up houses in May almost as soon as properties were listed, fueling the strongest sales rate in nearly a decade. Sales of existing homes rose 1.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest level since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. People remain intent on buying homes, despite the low inventory of properties on the market that has caused prices to rise. The elevated demand likely stems from low mortgage rates and a relatively healthy jobs picture with unemployment at 4.7 percent, even with a recent slowdown in hiring. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>IMF downgrades outlook for US economy</p><p>The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for the US economy this year and said America should raise the minimum wage to help the poor, offer paid maternity leave to encourage more women to work, and overhaul the corporate tax system to boost productivity. In its annual checkup of the US economy, the IMF on Wednesday predicted 2.2 percent US growth this year, down from 2.4 percent in 2015. In April, the international lending agency had forecast 2.4 percent growth for 2016. Still, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde (right), citing a healthy job market, says \"the US economy is in good shape.\" US unemployment fell last month to an eight-year low of 4.7 percent. The United States is growing faster than most other advanced economies. The IMF foresees 1.5 percent growth this year for the 19 countries that use the euro currency, and 0.5 percent growth for Japan. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>TELEVISION</p><p>Viacom launches online version of BET in 100 countries</p><p>Viacom Inc. introduced an online-only version of its BET cable TV network for international audiences in 100 countries, including China and Germany, a major expansion of a leading entertainment outlet for black viewers. Subscribers to BET Play will pay $3.99 a month for live feeds of major events, beginning with this weekend's 2016 BET Awards, along with access to the BET Soul channel and a library of hit shows on-demand, the New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Viacom is trying to turn another of its cable channels into a major force outside the United States. \u2014 BLOOMBERG</p><p>REAL ESTATE</p><p>Amityville Horror house up for sale</p><p>In 1974, it was an expensive and stately Long Island estate, nestled in a vintage-home village, with white shutters on the windows, white lattice on the side, and a white sign out front that read: \"High Hopes.\" But the house on Ocean Avenue in Amityville was darkened that year by a gruesome mass murder that claimed every family member there \u2014 except one. Ronald J. DeFeo Jr., the 23-year-old killer, was convicted of fatally shooting his parents and four siblings and was given six concurrent sentences of 25 years to life. It inspired a best-selling book and two films titled \"The Amityville Horror.\" Now, the infamous home where DeFeo killed his family is on the market for $850,000 \u2014 and was named Realtor.com's \"most popular\" house last week. The listing agent insists that the property's past isn't hurting its marketability. \u2014 WASHINGTON POST</p><p>TECHNOLOGY</p><p>New York bill to make it easier to fix broken iPhones dies</p><p>A bill that could make it easier to fix broken phones, computers, and tablets was killed in the New York state Legislature on Saturday when the session officially ended. Opposed by tech giants such as Apple, Cisco, and Xerox, the bill would have forced companies to release electronic parts and design manuals to independent repair shops. If passed, the bill could have been a boon to repair technicians and \"right-to-repair\" advocates nationwide. Advocates for the Fair Repair Act argue that if big tech companies give repair shops access to official manuals and electronic parts for devices, such as the iPhone, consumers would have more options to fix their phones and prolong a device's life. \u2014 WASHINGTON POST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-f979b02e-38a6-11e6-a5fd-57ec329388d8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K2V-7KB1-JC2G-C3NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 23, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000CR6Z</classCode><className>3G CAPITAL PARTNERS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>PEP (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Transaction volume remained steady compared to the first half of 2018, inching down by a mere 6 per cent and thus remaining in line with a remarkably stable trend since 2013. The trailing 30-month revenue multiple rose again to 2.8x EV/S, prolonging a trend visible over the last 18 months. In 2018, 186 healthcare companies went public, bringing aggregate gross IPO proceeds for the year to $24bn, up from only $15bn in 2017. Largest healthtech transactions The largest disclosed deals in the second half of 2018 included Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital's joint private equity acquisition ofathenahealth[1]for $5.7bn, at 17.3x EV/EBITDA. Athenahealth provides electronic healthcare record management SaaS for hospitals and healthcare practices in the U.S. Second, at $1bn, came the acquisition ofM*Modal[2]by 3M. M*Modal provides clinical documentation, transcription and EHR SaaS for the medical sector. Toronto's OneEleven opens London campus Dutch tech and health giant Philips remains the sector's most consistently active acquirer, with a total of seven acquisitions over the past 30 months, includingBlue Willow Systems[3]and its tracking and alert-based systems for senior living facilities. </p><p>Jonathan Simnett, director and healthtech specialist at Hampleton Partners, said: 'The rise of lifestyle diseases, an ageing population and higher patient expectations are compelling both public and private healthcare systems to incorporate technology to improve productivity, cost-efficiency and patient satisfaction.' Medical marijuana M...ctivity is now featuring in the medical marijuana sector, following regulatory changes in 10 US states and Washington D.C. In November, cannabis network marketing websiteLeafbuyer Technologies Inc[4]acquired Greenlight Technologies, a cannabis ordering and rewards mobile application. The app includes features such as loyalty programmes and real-time customer data analytics. It enables consumers to pre-order cannabis products and collect the orders at their local store. Such acquisitions are likely to become more frequent across the US as regulations continue to evolve. Beringea leads 2.4m investment in Deepcrawl Key trends in healthtech Established technology companies such as Amazon, Samsung and Cisco are looking for synergies and ways to enter the healthtech sector. Key examples of this trend include Amazon's acquisition of online pharmacy service PillPack for $1bn earlier in 2018, and Samsung's current collaboration with Stanford University and start-upSyncthink[5]to study the use of VR in establishing concussion severity. In addition, Cisco is working with GE Healthcare and Philips to provide the network support for device connection, security and data integration in healthcare. London's tech sector pledges job creation Self-service tech, such as health-monitoring software, drug-tracking apps or remote consultation interfaces, is generating interest amongst strategic and financial acquirers. All eyes are on data, especially as blockchain continues to disrupt the market with new ways of storing, securing and managing medical data. The move to the cloud also continues, with SaaS healthtech companies driving innovation for public and private health practices. Healthtech in 2019 Jonathan Simnett concluded: 'The M...andscape in healthtech remains promising. Big tech companies are entering the healthcare sector and healthcare professionals are keen to adopt technology that makes everything from transcribing patient notes, to diagnosis and treatment more effective and cost-efficient. 'New markets are being created by millions of consumers now monitoring their own health via apps and online programmes at home and on-the-go and by medical marijuana deregulation. 'Patient-oriented self-service healthtech billing and payment management, SaaS, EHR patient data and medical records systems will remain in particularly high demand by buyers, along with emerging blockchain applications which can improve the security and traceability of patient data, pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment.'

The trailing 30-month revenue multiple rose again to 2.8x EV/S, prolonging a trend visible over the last 18 months since the increase to 2.8x in H2 2017 from a lower 2.1x EV/S in H1 2017.<br/> \u00a0<br/> In 2018, 186 healthcare companies went public, bringing aggregate gross IPO proceeds for the year to USD24 billion, up from only USD15 billion in 2017.<br/> \u00a0<br/> The largest disclosed deals in the second half of 2018 included Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital's joint private equity acquisition of athenahealth for USD5.7 billion, at an attractive 17.3x EV/EBITDA. Athenahealth provides electronic healthcare record management SaaS for hospitals and healthcare practices in the US.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Second, at USD1 billion, came the acquisition of M*Modal by 3M. M*Modal provides clinical documentation, transcription and EHR SaaS for the medical sector.<br/> \u00a0<br/>Dutch tech and health giant Philips remains the sector's most consistently active acquirer, with a total of seven acquisitions over the past 30 months, including Blue Willow Systems and its tracking and alert-based systems for senior living facilities.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Jonathan Simnett, director and healthtech specialist at Hampleton Partners, says: \u20ac\u0153The rise of lifestyle diseases, an ageing population and higher patient expectations are compelling both public and private healthcare systems to incorporate technology to improve productivity, cost-efficiency and patient satisfaction.\u20ac<br/> \u00a0<br/> M&amp;A activity is now featuring in the medical marijuana sector, following regulatory changes in 10 US states and Washington DC. In November, cannabis network marketing website Leafbuyer Technologies Inc acquired Greenlight Technologies, a cannabis ordering and rewards mobile application. The app includes features such as loyalty programmes and real-time customer data analytics. It enables consumers to pre-order cannabis products and collect the orders at their local store. Such acquisitions are likely to become more frequent across the US as regulations continue to evolve.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Simnett says: \u20ac\u0153The M&amp;A landscape in healthtech remains promising. Big tech companies are entering the healthcare sector and healthcare professionals are keen to adopt technology that makes everything from transcribing patient notes, to diagnosis and treatment more effective and cost-efficient. New markets are being created by millions of consumers now monitoring their own health via apps and online programmes at home and on-the-go and by medical marijuana deregulation.\u20ac<br/> \u00a0<br/> \u20ac\u0153Patient-oriented self-service healthtech billing and payment management, SaaS, EHR patient data and medical records systems will remain in particularly high demand by buyers, along with emerging blockchain applications which can improve the security and traceability of patient data, pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment.\u20ac offCopy type:\u00a0pressrelease</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PVEQWR-273039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PVEQWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDN-G2T1-DXSP-900J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408428</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><timeReceived>09:42 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GFM Ltd.

The trailing 30-month revenue multiple rose again to 2.8x EV/S, prolonging a trend visible over the last 18 months, since the increase to 2.8x in 2H2017 from a lower 2.1x EV/S in 1H2017.<br/><br/>In 2018, 186 healthcare companies went public, bringing aggregate gross IPO proceeds for the year to $ 24 billion, up from only $ 15 billion in 2017.<br/><br/>Largest healthtech transactions<br/><br/>The largest disclosed deals in the second half of 2018 included Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital's joint private equity acquisition of athenahealth for $ 5.7 billion, at an attractive 17.3x EV/EBITDA. Athenahealth provides electronic healthcare record management SaaS for hospitals and healthcare practices in the U.S.<br/><br/>Second, at $ 1 billion, came the acquisition of M*Modal by 3M. M*Modal provides clinical documentation, transcription and EHR SaaS for the medical sector.<br/><br/>Dutch tech and health giant Philips remains the sector's most consistently active acquirer, with a total of seven acquisitions over the past 30 months, including Blue Willow Systems and its tracking and alert-based systems for senior living facilities.<br/><br/>Jonathan Simnett, director and healthtech specialist at Hampleton Partners, said:<br/><br/>\"The rise of lifestyle diseases, an ageing population and higher patient expectations are compelling both public and private healthcare systems to incorporate technology to improve productivity, cost-efficiency and patient satisfaction.\"<br/><br/>Medical marijuana<br/><br/>MA activity is now featuring in the medical marijuana sector, following regulatory changes in 10 U.S. states and Washington D.C. In November, cannabis network marketing website Leafbuyer Technologies Inc acquired Greenlight Technologies, a cannabis ordering and rewards mobile application. The app includes features such as loyalty programmes and real-time customer data analytics. It enables consumers to pre-order cannabis products and collect the orders at their local store. Such acquisitions are likely to become more frequent across the US as regulations continue to evolve.<br/><br/>Key trends in healthtech<br/><br/>*Established technology companies such as Amazon, Samsung and Cisco are looking for synergies and ways to enter the healthtech sector.<br/><br/>Key examples of this trend include Amazon's acquisition of online pharmacy service PillPack for $ 1 billion earlier in 2018, and Samsung's current collaboration with Stanford University and start-up Syncthink to study the use of VR in establishing concussion severity. In addition, Cisco is working with GE Healthcare and Philips to provide the network support for device connection, security and data integration in healthcare.<br/><br/>*Self-service tech, such as health-monitoring software, drug-tracking apps or remote consultation interfaces, is generating interest amongst strategic and financial acquirers.<br/><br/>*All eyes are on data, especially as blockchain continues to disrupt the market with new ways of storing, securing and managing medical data<br/><br/>*The move to the cloud continues, with SaaS healthtech companies driving innovation for public and private health practices<br/><br/>Healthtech in 2019<br/><br/>Jonathan Simnett concluded:<br/><br/>\"The MA landscape in healthtech remains promising. Big tech companies are entering the healthcare sector and healthcare professionals are keen to adopt technology that makes everything from transcribing patient notes, to diagnosis and treatment more effective and cost-efficient. New markets are being created by millions of consumers now monitoring their own health via apps and online programmes at home and on-the-go and by medical marijuana deregulation.<br/><br/>\"Patient-oriented self-service healthtech billing and payment management, SaaS, EHR patient data and medical records systems will remain in particularly high demand by buyers, along with emerging blockchain applications which can improve the security and traceability of patient data, pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment.\"<br/><br/>ENDS<br/><br/>Media enquiries, photography or interview requests, please contact:<br/><br/>Jane Henry<br/><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jane@marylebonemarketing.com\">jane@marylebonemarketing.com</email><br/><br/>Mob: +44 789 666 8155<br/><br/>Note to Editors:<br/><br/>Hampleton Partners' Healthtech Market Report 1H 2019 is compiled using data and information from the 451 Research database (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.451research.com\">www.451research.com</url>).<br/><br/>About Hampleton Partners<br/><br/>Hampleton Partners is at the forefront of international mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance advisory for companies with technology at their core.

The latest Healthtech MA Market Report from international technology mergers and acquisitions advisor, Hampleton Partners , revealed a final count of almost 100 deals in the healthtech sector in the second half of 2018. Transaction volume remained steady compared to 1H2018, inching down by a mere six per cent and thus remaining in line with a remarkably stable trend since 2013. The trailing 30-month revenue multiple rose again to 2.8x EV/S, prolonging a trend visible over the last 18 months, since the increase to 2.8x in 2H2017 from a lower 2.1x EV/S in 1H2017. Healthtech iPad In 2018, 186 healthcare companies went public, bringing aggregate gross IPO proceeds for the year to $24 billion, up from only $15 billion in 2017. Largest healthtech transactions<br/>The largest disclosed deals in the second half of 2018 included Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital's joint private equity acquisition of athenahealth for $5.7 billion, at an attractive 17.3x EV/EBITDA. </p><p>Athenahealth provides electronic healthcare record management SaaS for hospitals and healthcare practices in the U.S. Second, at $1 billion, came the acquisition of M*Modal by 3M. M*Modal provides clinical documentation, transcription and EHR SaaS for the medical sector. Dutch tech and health giant Philips remains the sector's most consistently active acquirer, with a total of seven acquisitions over the past 30 months, including Blue Willow Systems and its tracking and alert-based systems for senior living facilities. Jonathan Simnett, director and healthtech specialist at Hampleton Partners, said:<br/>\"The rise of lifestyle diseases, an ageing population and higher patient expectations are compelling both public and private healthcare systems to incorporate technology to improve productivity, cost-efficiency and patient satisfaction.\" Medical marijuana<br/>MA activity is now featuring in the medical marijuana sector, following regulatory changes in 10 U.S. states and Washington D.C. In November, cannabis network marketing website Leafbuyer Technologies Inc acquired Greenlight Technologies, a cannabis ordering and rewards mobile application. The app includes features such as loyalty programmes and real-time customer data analytics. It enables consumers to pre-order cannabis products and collect the orders at their local store. Such acquisitions are likely to become more frequent across the US as regulations continue to evolve. Key trends in healthtech Established technology companies such as Amazon, Samsung and Cisco are looking for synergies and ways to enter the healthtech sector. Self-service tech, such as health-monitoring software, drug-tracking apps or remote consultation interfaces, is generating interest amongst strategic and financial acquirers. All eyes are on data, especially as blockchain continues to disrupt the market with new ways of storing, securing and managing medical data The move to the cloud continues, with SaaS healthtech companies driving innovation for public and private health practices Healthtech in 2019<br/>Jonathan Simnett concluded:<br/>\"The MA landscape in healthtech remains promising. Big tech companies are entering the healthcare sector and healthcare professionals are keen to adopt technology that makes everything from transcribing patient notes, to diagnosis and treatment more effective and cost-efficient. New markets are being created by millions of consumers now monitoring their own health via apps and online programmes at home and on-the-go and by medical marijuana deregulation. \"Patient-oriented self-service healthtech billing and payment management, SaaS, EHR patient data and medical records systems will remain in particularly high demand by buyers, along with emerging blockchain applications which can improve the security and traceability of patient data, pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment.\" ENDS Media enquiries, photography or interview requests, please contact:<br/>Jane Henry<br/>Email:<br/>Mob: +44 789 666 8155 Note to Editors:<br/>Hampleton Partners' Healthtech Market Report 1H 2019 is compiled using data and information from the 451 Research database ( www.451research.com ).

Some products will need Food and Drug Administration approval, while others won't and could reach store shelves relatively quickly. Moore figures it could take a decade for wireless technology to permeate health care. But he also predicts a \"tipping point,\" when it will reach enough market saturation to fuel rapid acceleration of wireless devices and systems in the industry globally.</p><p>Software Is the Workhorse</p><p>Whatever innovative wireless products are produced for the health care industry, says Bob Slapin, they will all be rooted in software development.</p><p>\"What's going to make it work is the software that controls the data, security and user interface,\" said Slapin, executive director of the San Diego Software Industry Council.</p><p>Slapin says there's a \"fallacy\" mentality in the industry that wireless devices--hardware--are the key to meeting the health care market's efficiency needs. Whether it is wireless access to electronic medical records or mobile heart monitoring devices, \"the hardware is not the issue,\" he says, noting that a telephone's software, for example, is what makes it work. \"The hardware issues, I think, have been addressed.\"</p><p>While demand for wireless medical devices evolves, says Slapin, he sees more doctors using hand-held devices displaying patient charts that they can enter data into and then transmit wirelessly to a central database.</p><p>One obstacle to developing wireless data systems for health care, says Slapin, is more social than scientific, with concerns of preserving the privacy of medical records.</p><p>Beyond that, he notes the medical profession has historically been slow to change its institutional ways of doing things. But that's for a reason. When medical records and human lives are at stake, he adds, the industry \"has to be conservative and cautious.\"</p><p>And now, telecommunications industry standardization of wireless transmission protocols used in health care products has yet to be hammered out.</p><p>\"Microsoft, HP, and every technology company you can think of are trying to get into this,\" said Slapin. \"Each one is doing it in their own (wireless) standard.\"</p><p>Clash of Protocol Standards</p><p>Richard Campbell, a partner at San Diego law firm Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves &amp; Savitch LLP, specializes in intellectual property cases involving electronics, communications, software and medical devices.</p><p>He, too, sees the big tech players moving to get a piece of the developing wireless health care market. But in San Diego, he notes there are clusters of smaller, early stage companies working on wireless solutions for the niche. And he also notes a clash of wireless protocol standards that will have to be resolved among device makers, be they big or small.</p><p>Campbell expects wireless health care products' telecommunications standards will eventually be piggybacked on existing cell phone and local area network protocols. They are open source platforms without the market restraints of a proprietary protocol used by one company. And because an open source wireless platform is more conducive to broader market use because of its open accessibility, it will offer less risk for investors.</p><p>\"This is one of the strongest wireless tech hubs in the country,\" said Campbell. Because it is a hybrid of health care and wireless technologies, each attract investors that range from the health care arena, venture capital funds and strategic investors.</p><p>Health care providers can use wireless device applications for routine monitoring tasks, says Campbell. For example, they can record heart rates and diabetes symptoms that can be sent from patients remotely for doctor database reviews in a hospital. That can limit the number of a patient's doctor visits and cut costs.</p><p>While there may be concerns about how private personal medical data sent wirelessly will be, Campbell doesn't see it as a technological problem.</p><p>\"The president of the United States uses a secure cell phone,\" he said, as an example.</p><p>Challenged to Integrate Systems</p><p>The challenge to wireless-based solutions is to be able to offer an entire data collection system that a hospital can incorporate into its existing care delivery system, says Campbell.

Some products will need Food and Drug Administration approval, while others won't and could reach store shelves relatively quickly. Moore figures it could take a decade for wireless technology to permeate health care. But he also predicts a \"tipping point,\" when it will reach enough market saturation to fuel rapid acceleration of wireless devices and systems in the industry globally.</p><p>Software Is the Workhorse</p><p>Whatever innovative wireless products are produced for the health care industry, says Bob Slapin, they will all be rooted in software development.</p><p>\"What's going to make it work is the software that controls the data, security and user interface,\" said Slapin, executive director of the San Diego Software Industry Council.</p><p>Slapin says there's a \"fallacy\" mentality in the industry that wireless devices--hardware--are the key to meeting the health care market's efficiency needs. Whether it is wireless access to electronic medical records or mobile heart monitoring devices, \"the hardware is not the issue,\" he says, noting that a telephone's software, for example, is what makes it work. \"The hardware issues, I think, have been addressed.\"</p><p>While demand for wireless medical devices evolves, says Slapin, he sees more doctors using hand-held devices displaying patient charts that they can enter data into and then transmit wirelessly to a central database.</p><p>One obstacle to developing wireless data systems for health care, says Slapin, is more social than scientific, with concerns of preserving the privacy of medical records.</p><p>Beyond that, he notes the medical profession has historically been slow to change its institutional ways of doing things. But that's for a reason. When medical records and human lives are at stake, he adds, the industry \"has to be conservative and cautious.\"</p><p>And now, telecommunications industry standardization of wireless transmission protocols used in health care products has yet to be hammered out.</p><p>\"Microsoft, HP, and every technology company you can think of are trying to get into this,\" said Slapin. \"Each one is doing it in their own (wireless) standard.\"</p><p>Clash of Protocol Standards</p><p>Richard Campbell, a partner at San Diego law firm Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves &amp; Savitch LLP, specializes in intellectual property cases involving electronics, communications, software and medical devices.</p><p>He, too, sees the big tech players moving to get a piece of the developing wireless health care market. But in San Diego, he notes there are clusters of smaller, early stage companies working on wireless solutions for the niche. And he also notes a clash of wireless protocol standards that will have to be resolved among device makers, be they big or small.</p><p>Campbell expects wireless health care products' telecommunications standards will eventually be piggybacked on existing cell phone and local area network protocols. They are open source platforms without the market restraints of a proprietary protocol used by one company. And because an open source wireless platform is more conducive to broader market use because of its open accessibility, it will offer less risk for investors.</p><p>\"This is one of the strongest wireless tech hubs in the country,\" said Campbell. Because it is a hybrid of health care and wireless technologies, each attract investors that range from the health care arena, venture capital funds and strategic investors.</p><p>Health care providers can use wireless device applications for routine monitoring tasks, says Campbell. For example, they can record heart rates and diabetes symptoms that can be sent from patients remotely for doctor database reviews in a hospital. That can limit the number of a patient's doctor visits and cut costs.</p><p>While there may be concerns about how private personal medical data sent wirelessly will be, Campbell doesn't see it as a technological problem.</p><p>\"The president of the United States uses a secure cell phone,\" he said, as an example.</p><p>Challenged to Integrate Systems</p><p>The challenge to wireless-based solutions is to be able to offer an entire data collection system that a hospital can incorporate into its existing care delivery system, says Campbell. And developing something for institutional adoption such as that, which includes following federal rules and regulations, he adds, \"is never fast, never a one-year turnaround.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDBUSJ-734594095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDBUSJ2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JF4-FKN1-JBHT-D2MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2010 San Diego Business Journal Jul 12, 2010</copyright><publicationName>San Diego Business Journal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 87506890</issn><volume>Vol 31</volume><issueNumber>No. 28</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>July 12, 2010 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

With big-data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and other novel methods, they promise to cut costs for struggling healthcare systems, revolutionise how doctors make medical decisions, and save us from ourselves. What could possibly go wrong?<br/>Quite a lot, it turns out. In Weapons of Math Destruction, data scientist Cathy O'Neil lists many examples of how algorithms and data can fail us in unsuspecting ways. When transparent data-feedback algorithms were applied to baseball, they worked better than expected; but when similar models are used in finance, insurance, law enforcement, and education, they can be highly discriminatory and destructive.<br/>Healthcare is no exception. Individuals' medical data are susceptible to subjective clinical decision-making, medical errors, and evolving practices, and the quality of larger data sets is often diminished by missing records, measurement errors, and a lack of structure and standardisation. Nonetheless, the big-data revolution in health care is being sold as if these troubling limitations did not exist. Worse, many medical decision-makers are falling for the hype.<br/>One could argue that as long as new solutions offer some benefits, they are worth it. But we cannot really know whether data analytics and AI actually do improve on the status quo without large, well-designed empirical studies. Not only is such evidence lacking; there is no infrastructure or regulatory framework in place to generate it. Big-data applications are simply being introduced into health-care settings as if they were harmless or unquestionably beneficial.<br/>Consider Project Nightingale, a private data-sharing arrangement between Google Health and Ascension, a massive non-profit health system in the US. When the Wall Street Journal first reported on this secret relationship last November, it triggered a scandal over concerns about patient data and privacy. Worse, as Feinberg openly admitted to the same newspaper just two months later, \"We didn't know what we were doing.\"<br/>Given that the Big Tech companies have no experience in health care, such admissions should come as no surprise, despite the attempts to reassure us otherwise. Worse, at a time when individual privacy is becoming more of a luxury than a right, the algorithms that are increasingly ruling our lives are becoming inaccessible black boxes, shielded from public or regulatory scrutiny to protect corporate interests. And in the case of healthcare, algorithmic diagnostic and decision models sometimes return results that doctors themselves do not understand.<br/>Although many of those pouring into the health-tech arena are well-intentioned, the industry's current approach is fundamentally unethical and poorly informed. No one objects to improving healthcare with technology. But before rushing into partnerships with tech companies, healthcare executives and providers need to improve their understanding of the health-tech field.<br/>For starters, it is critical to remember that big-data inferences are gleaned through statistics and mathematics, which demand their own form of literacy. When an algorithm detects \"causality\" or some other association signal, that information can be valuable for conducting further hypothesis-driven investigations. But when it comes to actual decision-making, mathematically driven predictive models are only as reliable as the data being fed into them. And because their fundamental assumptions are based on what is already known, they offer a view of the past and the present, not the future. Such applications have far-reaching potential to improve healthcare and cut costs; but those gains are not guaranteed.<br/>Another critical area is AI, which requires both its own architecture \u2013 that is, the rules and basic logic that determine how the system operates \u2013 and access to massive amounts of potentially sensitive data. The goal is to position the system so that it can \"teach\" itself how to deliver optimal solutions to stated problems. But, here, one must remember that the creators of the architecture \u2013 the people writing the rules and articulating the problems \u2013 are as biased as anyone else, whether they mean to be or not. Moreover, as with data analytics, AI systems are guided by data from the current healthcare system, making them prone to replicating its own failures and successes.<br/>At the end of the day, improving healthcare through big data and AI will likely take much more trial and error than techno-optimists realise. If conducted transparently and publicly, big-data projects can teach us how to create high-quality data sets prospectively, thereby increasing algorithmic solutions' chances of success. By the same token, the algorithms themselves should be made available at least to regulators and the organisations subscribing to the service, if not to the public.<br/>Above all, healthcare providers and governments should remove their rose-tinted glasses and think critically about the implications of largely untested new applications in health care. Rather than simply giving away patient records and other data, hospitals and regulators should shadow the tech-sector developers who are designing the architecture and deploying experimental new systems. More people need to be offering feedback and questioning the assumptions underlying initial prototypes, and this must be followed by controlled experiments to assess these technologies' real-world performance.<br/>Having been massively overhyped, big-data healthcare solutions are being rushed to market in without meaningful regulation, transparency, standardisation, accountability, or robust validation practices. Patients deserve health systems and providers that will protect them, rather than using them as mere sources of data for profit-driven experiments. \u2013 Project Syndicate<br/><br/>* Leeza Osipenko is Senior Lecturer in Practice in the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/47/159580814109.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/47/159580814109.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-180596858</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FK-57D1-F11P-X0WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1166\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

LONDON \u2013 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, David Feinberg, the head of Google Health and a self-professed astrology buff, enthused that, \u201cIf you believe me that all we are doing is organizing information to make it easier for your doctor, I\u2019m going to get a little paternalistic here: I\u2019m never going to let that get opted out.\u201d In other words, patients will soon have no choice but to receive personalized clinical horoscopes based on their own medical histories and inferences drawn from a growing pool of patient records. But even if we want such a world, we should take a hard look at what today\u2019s health-tech proponents are really selling.    In recent years, most of the United States\u2019 Big Tech firms \u2013 along with many startups, the Big Pharma companies, and others \u2013 have entered the health-tech sector . With big-data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and other novel methods, they promise to cut costs for struggling health-care systems, revolutionize how doctors make medical decisions, and save us from ourselves. What could possibly go wrong?   Quite a lot, it turns out. In Weapons of Math Destruction , data scientist Cathy O\u2019Neil lists many examples of how algorithms and data can fail us in unsuspecting ways.

At the end of the day, improving health care through big data and AI will likely take much more trial and error than techno-optimists realize. If conducted transparently and publicly, big-data projects can teach us how to create high-quality data sets prospectively , thereby increasing algorithmic solutions\u2019 chances of success. By the same token, the algorithms themselves should be made available at least to regulators and the organizations subscribing to the service, if not to the public.   Above all, health-care providers and governments should remove their rose-tinted glasses and think critically about the implications of largely untested new applications in health care. Rather than simply giving away patient records and other data, hospitals and regulators should shadow the tech-sector developers who are designing the architecture and deploying experimental new systems. More people need to be offering feedback and questioning the assumptions underlying initial prototypes, and this must be followed by controlled experiments to assess these technologies\u2019 real-world performance.   Having been massively overhyped, big-data health-care solutions are being rushed to market in without meaningful regulation, transparency, standardization, accountability, or robust validation practices . Patients deserve health systems and providers that will protect them, rather than using them as mere sources of data for profit-driven experiments.

The Judiciary Committee will come to order.  Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time.  I'm going to recognize myself for an opening statement, then the ranking member, and then the chairman and the ranking member of the appropriate subcommittee.</p><p>Today's hearing is on legislation that will help protect one of the most productive sectors of the American economy.  While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does provide some relief to copyright owners whose works are infringed, it only helps in limited circumstances.  The DMCA provides no effective relief when a rogue website is foreign-based and foreign-operated, like The Pirate Bay, the 89th most visited site in the U.S.  It doesn't protect trademark owners and consumers from counterfeit and unsafe products like fake prescription medicines and misbranded drugs that are often presented to the public by unlicensed online pharmacies, nor does the law assist copyright owners when rogue websites contribute to the theft of intellectual property on a massive scale.  And finally, it does nothing to address the use of certain intermediaries such as payment processors and Internet advertising services that are used by criminals to fund the illegal activities.</p><p>REP.      :  Mr. Chairman --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  That's where the Stop --</p><p>REP.      :  Mr. Chairman, I'm having trouble hearing your statement.  Can --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  I wouldn't want anyone to miss my statement, so I'll make sure that the sound system is working and that I'm close enough to the mike.</p><p>REP.      :  Turn his mic way up.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK.  That's where the Stop Online Piracy Act comes in.  This bill focuses not on technology, but on preventing those who engage in criminal behavior from reaching directly into the U.S. market to harm American consumers.  We cannot continue a system that allows criminals to disregard our laws and import counterfeit and pirated goods across our physical borders.  Nor can we fail to take effective and meaningful action when criminals misuse the Internet.</p><p>The problem of rogue websites is real, immediate and widespread. It harms all sectors of the economy and its scope is staggering.  One recent survey found that nearly one-quarter of global Internet traffic infringes on copyrights.  A second study found that 43 sites classified as digital piracy generated 53 billion visits per year, and that 26 sites selling just counterfeit prescription drugs generated 51 million hits annually.  Since the United States produces the most intellectual property, our country has the most to lose if we fail to address the problem of these rogue websites.  Responsible companies and public officials have taken note of the corrosive and damaging effects of rogue websites.</p><p>One of our witnesses today represents MasterCard Worldwide, a company that takes seriously its obligation to reduce the amount of stolen intellectual property on the Internet.  MasterCard deserves thanks for its commitment to support legislation that addresses the problems of online piracy.</p><p>In contrast, another one of the companies represented here today has sought to obstruct the committee's consideration of bipartisan legislation.  Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that Google just settled a federal criminal investigation into the company's active promotion of rogue websites that pushed illegal prescription and counterfeit drugs on American consumers.  In announcing a half-billion dollar forfeiture of illegal profits, the U.S. Attorney, Peter Neronha, who led the investigation, stated, quote, \"suffice it to say that this is not two or three rogue employees at the consumer service level doing this.  This was a corporate decision to engage in this conduct,\" end quote.</p><p>Over several years, Google ignored repeated warnings from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University that the company was violating federal law.  The company also disregarded requests to block advertisements from rogue pharmacies, screen such sites from searches and provide warnings about buying drugs over the Internet. The Wall Street Journal reports Mr. Neronha characterized Google's efforts to appear to control unlawful advertisements as window dressing, since, quote, \"it allowed Google to continue earning revenues from the allegedly illicit ad sales even as it professed to be taking action against them,\" end quote.  Given Google's record, their objection to authorizing a court to order a search engine to not steer consumers to foreign rogue sites is easily understood.</p><p>Unfortunately, the theft of America's intellectual property costs the United States economy more than $100 billion annually and results in a loss of thousands of American jobs.  Under current law rogue sites that profit from selling pirated goods are often out of the reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies and operate without consequences.  The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures the profits from American innovations go to American innovators.  Protecting America's intellectual property will help our economy, create jobs and discourage illegal websites.</p><p>That concludes my opening statement, and the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, is recognized for his opening statement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE JOHN CONYERS (D-MI):  Thank you, Chairman Smith, and good morning to my fellow colleagues on the committee.  This is a very important hearing, and I want to commend you on your statement because you raised some issues that I think we will have to go into quite carefully.</p><p>Now, there've been attempts to deal with the problem that's before us today.  But H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act, represents a great deal of work and some experience from our attempts to deal with this subject before.  I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan bill, and I think that's very important.  Now, there've been a number of attempts to stop online intellectual property theft and fraud. Some of the leading Internet service providers and right holders and the best practices standards that are being developed within the advertising network and payment processing companies and particularly MasterCard have all come to my attention.</p><p>I commend them.</p><p>But this private cooperation is not sufficient.  Our studies have shown that upwards of one-quarter of all Internet traffic is copyright infringing.  And to those who say that a bill to stop online theft will break the Internet, I'd like to point out that it's not likely to happen.  Users connect to the Internet through service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon, but by most accounts -- and I have to bring up Google's name again in the beginning of this discussion -- Google's search engine connects users to Internet content more often than any other and places the most advertisements.  As users surf the web their computers connect with domain name servers to resolve the site name that they type into their browser and its location on the web.</p><p>Now, we're getting a number of reactions from this proposal. Some right holders have said that the market-based process outlined in Section 103 of the bill doesn't go far enough and it immunizes too many players who profit from piracy.  But on the other hand, there are some in the technology section that have said this bill will break the Internet and strangle start-ups and Silicon Valley giants alike.  And so I reluctantly ask to put this into the record, \"The Attack of the Internet Killers.\"  This is --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Without objection, that'll be made a part --</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  -- it's a very serious business.  Don't walk; run. Tell Congress there's a better way.  Threatens global Internet security, kills cloud computer and an American job crushing monster. That's our bill H.R. 3261.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Isn't that a comic?</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  (Laughs.)  No, this is serious.  It's a -- it's a terrible thing and that we ought to know better.</p><p>Now, on a more serious note, we have, from our friends in the American Civil Liberties Union, a caution that I have to take more seriously, because they have some questions that they -- I don't -- I don't think -- I think needs to be examined here.  And that is -- the first is that there's an attorney general section of the bill that only the Justice Department, in its wisdom, can ask a court to filter or block web content.  What the American Civil Liberties Union is telling us is that we will, with this legislation, inadvertently involve nonfringing operators and that this would violate their constitutional rights.</p><p>Now, against that I'm going to ask to put in the eminent First Amendment scholar Floyd Abrams' recommendation that says that the notion that this bill threatens freedom of expression is insupportable.  It protects creators of free speech as Congress has done, and the Judiciary Committee especially has been particularly sensitive to protecting.  And so I ask unanimous consent to put in the statement of Attorney Floyd Abrams, and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Without objection.  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.</p><p>The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA):  Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing, and thank you for your leadership on this issue.</p><p>For more than two centuries America's economic strength has been built on a firm foundation.  The rule of law, respect for individuals and private property, and the promotion of industry through policies that reward creativity and innovation are essential virtues that helped a fledgling nation encourage the initiative of its citizens and in time emerge as the most advanced and prosperous on earth.  These virtues are not universal.  In an increasingly connected world threats that emanate from areas where these principles are not shared are jeopardizing our ability to sustain the incentives needed to foster growth and development and advance human progress.  These threats create challenges for us in both the physical world and the virtual world where the systematic and willful violation of intellectual property rights now poses a clear, present and growing danger to American creators and innovators, U.S. consumers and our collective confidence in the Internet ecosystem.</p><p>In order to continue to incentivize artists, authors and inventors, we need to ensure that these creators have the ability to earn a return on their investment.  Increasingly, foreign piracy is stripping creators of that ability.  Within the Internet ecosystem today there are legitimate commercial sites that offer consumers authorized goods and services.  Indeed, many exciting new technologies and websites help content owners distribute music, movies, books, games, software and other copyrighted works in ways that were not even imaginable ten years ago.  However, there are also rogue sites that steal the intellectual property of others and traffic in counterfeit and pirated goods.  In recent years these websites have grown and evolved.  They've become increasingly sophisticated and rival legitimate sites in appearance, operation and indicia of reliability.</p><p>U.S. consumers are frequently led to these sites by search engines that list them among the top search results.  After clicking on a site they are immediately reassured by the logos of U.S. payment processors and the presence of major corporate advertising supporting the site.  These sites sell infringing copyrighted works, but they are not limited to those.  Increasingly these sites also offer counterfeit goods, such as counterfeit automobile parts, medicines, baby formula and other products that can pose serious threats to the health and safety of American citizens.  What's worse, these rogue sites often list the real customer service contact information for the legitimate companies which deteriorate the reputation of the legitimate maker of these goods.</p><p>For all these reasons I have joined Chairman Smith in introducing the Stop Online Piracy Act, which creates new tools for law enforcement to combat these growing threats.  Specifically, this legislation gives law enforcement the authority to bring an action in a federal court to declare a website in violation of the law, and allows the court to issue a court order to intermediaries to block transactions and access to those sites found to be infringing.  The bill also provides content owners with a limited liability to request a court to declare a website as violating the law.  However, the content owners must first attempt to work directly with financial services and advertising intermediaries to solve the problem.  Only if those parties cannot reach agreement are content owners allowed to seek a court declaration against an infringing website.  It is my hope that this provision will allow content owners and intermediaries to work together to route out infringing sites quickly.</p><p>It should be noted that there has been criticism from many in the online community about the scope of this bill, its effect on the functioning of the Internet and that it could entangle legitimate websites.  It's my -- it is not my intention to do so, and I stand ready to work with the tech community to address any legitimate concerns they have.  I have requested detailed comments from the tech community about their concerns and look forward to continuing to work with them and Chairman Smith and other members of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that this legislation punishes lawbreakers while protecting content owners as well as legitimate online innovators and start-ups.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, but a number of issues raised about it need to be carefully addressed.  I look forward to working with you on those issues as we move forward to protect content owners online, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, the ranking member of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MEL WATT (D-NC):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, in my experience there's usually only one thing at stake when we have long lines outside a hearing as we do today, and when giant companies like those opposing this bill and their supporters start throwing around rhetoric like this is -- this bill will kill the Internet, or it's an attempt to build the great firewall of America.  And that one thing is usually money.</p><p>While I appreciate that the stakeholders of Internet companies that have market caps in the billions of dollars care, as we all do, about the First Amendment and other precious rights, it seems clear to me that the obstinate opposition we have seen in the days since introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act is really about the bottom line.  Piracy and counterfeiting make money and lots of it.  This is not speculative.  Sites that specialize in stolen goods attract a lot of eyeballs, which in turn attracts a lot of advertising, which in turn means, well, you got it, lots of money.</p><p>To be fair, many of the copyright and trademark owners who want this bill to help enforce their rights are also businesses and are also motivated by money.  But in mind stopping theft of your work or products is an appropriate incentive to secure a profit.  But doing nothing or next to nothing to prevent theft through the use of tools a company creates or controls is not an appropriate incentive to secure profits.</p><p>So as policymakers our goal must be to confront the criminal enterprises that are flourishing on the Internet, stealing from the rights holders and visiting untold harms on consumers.  Doing nothing is not an option.  Not only are online piracy and counterfeiting drains on our economy, they expose unwary consumers to fraud, identity theft, confusion and, at worst, physical harm.  The penetration of hazardous products and goods into the American marketplace, including our military supply chain, poses an unacceptable risk of serious bodily injury or death to our citizens.  Tolerance of online theft of music, movies and software reinforces a culture of entitlement, stifles creativity, injures artists and undermines job stability and growth.</p><p>While I have never been a big advocate of current seizure laws, why would we not, as this bill does, give the attorney general, at a minimum, the same power to block foreign thieves from access to the U.S. markets as the attorney general has for domestic markets?  Given the limits of government resources, why should we not establish a framework to enable rights holders to engage specific intermediaries within the Internet ecosystem to meet the challenges of online piracy and counterfeiting?</p><p>I think one of the big problems here is that to date the economic incentives for the big Internet companies to work against online piracy are just not there.  To be sure, there are many intermediaries that are inadvertently involved with pirate sites and who have come to the table with constructive suggestions for crafting a balanced bill that will work.  I commend ISPs, payment processors like MasterCard, who share today, and Visa, Go Daddy, who is the largest registrar of domain names, and a number of software companies who have raised reasonable concerns and are willing to work together to address them.</p><p>But again, when I hear overblown claims like this bill is a, quote, giveaway to greedy trial lawyers, or a killer of innovation and entrepreneurs, that the co-sponsors of this bill are the Internet killers, I become suspicious of the message as well as the messengers. And as one who cares deeply about the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process, it is beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the flood gates to government censorship.  That's simply not the world we live in, and to suggest that by establishing a means to combat theft of intellectual property online we will somehow devolve into a repressive regime belittles the circumstances under which true victims of tyrannical government actually live.  I urge everyone to set aside all the hyperbole and accusations.</p><p>I'm the first to admit that I don't like or love everything about this bill, but it's very strong -- it's a very strong, solid effort to begin the process of responsibly providing the attorney general and rights holders with necessary tools to keep pace with and ultimately to outpace the high-tech bandits roving the Internet.  I believe there are still some things we can do in the legislation to avoid unintended consequences, maintain the integrity of the Internet, and preserve certain freedoms, including many of the specific suggestions made by the ranking member.  Our staffs have worked closely together to identify ways to improve this bill, and we will continue to do so. And I appreciate the fact that crafting a bill governing online -- in the online environment requires attention to technological detail, but I start from the premise that Internet freedom does not and cannot mean Internet lawlessness, and that the goals of freedom and lawfulness are no more incompatible in the Internet space than they are in the physical world.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, there's an African proverb that says when elephants fight it's the grass that suffers.  Perhaps if we refocus this debate on the ills that may befall innocent consumers who fall prey to the perils of pirated and counterfeited goods, rather than on the balance sheets of all the big companies, we can reach a worthy compromise.  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and engaging in ongoing dialog as we move the bill forward.  The stakes for America and American consumers are too high to get engaged in too much hyperbole.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Watt.  Without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.</p><p>We welcome our distinguished panelists today, and I will now introduce them.  Our first witness is Maria Pallante, the register of copyrights.  Ms. Pallante was appointed by the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, as the 12th register on June 1st of this year. Immediately prior to that appointment Ms. Pallante served as the acting register.  As register Ms. Pallante continues the tradition of serving as the principle advisor to Congress on matters of copyright policy.  Ms. Pallante has spent much of her career in the office where she previously served as the associate register for policy and international affairs, deputy general counsel and policy advisor.  In addition, Ms. Pallante spent nearly a decade as intellectual property counsel and director of licensing for the Guggenheim Museums in New York.  She earned her law degree from George Washington University and her bachelor's degree from Misericordia University, where she was also awarded an honorary degree of humane letters.</p><p>Our second witness is John P. Clark, the vice president of global security and chief security officer for Pfizer.  Since joining Pfizer in 2008 Mr. Clark has been recognized as a leading authority on the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to patient health and safety. Prior to joining Pfizer Mr. Clark served as deputy assistant secretary of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  In that capacity he was responsible for overall management and coordination of the agency's operation, and he served as the assistant secretary's principle representative to the Department of Homeland Security and to the law enforcement and intelligence communities.  Starting as a U.S. border patrol agent in 1980, Mr. Clark spent more than 25 years as a law enforcement professional before retiring from public service.  A New York native, Mr. Clark received his bachelor of science degree in history from the State University of New York at Binghamton and a master of science degree from National Lewis University.  Before joining DOJ -- wup (ph), excuse me.</p><p>Our third witness is Michael O'Leary, the senior executive vice president for global policy and external affairs at the Motion Picture Association of America.  In that position Mr. O'Leary supervises all international, federal and state affairs operations around the world for the association.  Before moving to MPAA Mr. O'Leary served more than a dozen years at the Department of Justice where he worked on legislative, intellectual property and enforcement issues.  During his tenure at the DOJ he served as the deputy chief of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section where he prosecuted and supervised some of the most significant domestic and international criminal and IP cases undertaken by the department.  Before joining DOJ Mr. O'Leary spent five years serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He grew up in Montana, is a graduate of Arizona State University and the University of Arizona School of Law.</p><p>Our fourth witness is Ms. Linda Kirkpatrick who serves as the group head of Customer Performance Integrity at MasterCard Worldwide. In this role Ms. Kirkpatrick is responsible for driving the strategy, development and execution of global customer compliance programs, data integrity, and dispute resolution and management.  Ms. Kirkpatrick has been with MasterCard since 1997.  She earned her bachelor of arts degree in economics with a concentration in finance from Mahattanville College in Purchase, New York.</p><p>Our fifth witness is Katherine Oyama, policy counsel for Google where she focuses on copyright and trademark law and policy.  From 2009 to early 2011 she worked in the Office of the Vice President as associate counsel and deputy counsel to Vice President Joseph R. Biden.  Prior to her government service Ms. Oyama was a litigation associate with Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr where she worked on intellectual property cases, government regulatory litigation and pro bono matters.</p><p>She previously worked in the media entertainment practice of a New York-based strategy consulting firm, for the Silicon Valley-based Internet start-up Loudcloud Inc., and for the Texas-based company Electrona (sic) Data Systems.  Ms. Oyama is a graduate of Smith College where she graduated with honors in government, and the University of Cal at Berkeley School of Law where she served as senior articles editor of the Berkeley Technology Law Journal.</p><p>Our final witness is Paul Almeida, the president of the -- of the Department of Professional Employees of the AFL-CIO.  Mr. Almeida has served as president of the DPE since February, 2001.  Prior to his tenure with DPE Mr. Almeida served as president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers for seven years. Mr. Almeida earned his degree in engineering from Franklin Institute in Boston, and he resides in Arlington, Massachusetts.</p><p>We welcome you all.  Every member of the panel will have five minutes to give their testimony, and we have a light on the table to indicate when that time is about to expire and has expired.  Again, we welcome you.  And Ms. Pallante, we'll begin with you.</p><p>MARIA PALLANTE:  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear today.  And I would also like to thank you, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt of the subcommittee, and all of the members of the committee for your continued leadership on copyright policy.</p><p>Congress has updated the Copyright Act many times in the past 200 years, including the enforcement provisions.  But as we all know, this work is never finished.  Infringers today are sophisticated and they are bold.  They blatantly stream and disseminate books, music, films and software through websites using the services of trusted search engines, advertising networks and credit card companies.  This is not a problem that we can accept.  In my view, it is about the rule of law on the Internet.</p><p>Much of the bill employs a strategy of follow the money.  I testified in support of this approach in March, and I still agree that it is an important part of the equation.  Many sites make money by selling illegal access to copyrighted works or by offering related advertising.  But the approach does have some limitations.  Many of the worst sites do not sell infringing content; they offer it for free.  And they do not run ads.  I would like to offer an example involving Google, but I would first like to say that I have a great deal of respect for Google and I cannot imagine the Internet without it.  However, if you conduct a search for the phrase download movies, Google search engine will supply the words for free and it will return a list of sites that offer illegal copies or streams at no charge and with no advertising.  These cases require a different kind of strategy than follow the money.  The same is true when damage is imminent, for example, when a site is streaming live sporting events or selling movies before they have been released to the public.</p><p>In the context of foreign infringing sites, the bill addresses this problem by giving the Department of Justice the power to require search engines to dismantle direct hyperlinks and to require service providers to block the access of subscribers within the United States. These actions require court approval and incorporate the existing legal standards of seizure and civil forfeiture law.  These are the same standards that ISA's used effectively for operation in our sites.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to suggest that blocking websites is a small step.  It is not.  And the public interest groups that oppose this part of the bill are right to be concerned about unintended consequences.  However, it may ultimately come down to a question of philosophy for Congress.  If the attorney general is chasing 21st century infringers, what kinds of tools does Congress want to provide? How broad and how flexible?  The bill also gives copyright owners some tools, but these do not involve search engines or ISPs, and I think that this is the right calibration.  Put another way, the bill reflects the fact that many industries contribute to the success of the Internet, and it properly distinguishes between the actions that law enforcement and private citizens can bring.</p><p>One of the more interesting aspects of the bill is that before authors or other copyright owners can seek court orders it requires them to alert payment processors and ad networks about infringing content and requests that they sever financial ties.  This approach is creative and it provides incentives for the parties to cooperate.  It also allows for counter-notification.  However, whether the notification system is ultimately effective will largely depend upon whether it can be implemented in a manner that is clear and fair for all involved.  The intermediaries at issue are running businesses in good faith, and the websites at issue are entitled to due process. The bill does incorporate due process where court orders are involved. The notification system would operate outside the purview of a court and therefore, it may benefit from further due process review.</p><p>Finally, I do not believe it is the intent of the bill to negate the safe harbors of the DMCA, and I do not read it that way.  Nothing subjects ISPs to liability for their acts or their failures to act. No monetary relief can be obtained and the injunctive relief permitted by the bill appears to be consistent with what the DMCA already permits.</p><p>This said, the bill has many moving parts and I note that a number of stakeholders with differing perspectives have offered productive suggestions.  As the committee works to refine the bill I would encourage you to fully consider these suggestions.  However, in closing, I would also like to state that I believe that Congress has a responsibility to protect the exclusive rights of copyright owners, and I hope that you will advance the bill with this in mind.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p>Mr. Clark.</p><p>JOHN CLARK:  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, distinguished members of the committee --</p><p>REP.      :  Can you pull the mike a little bit closer please, or turn it on?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  It's a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the threat that counterfeits medicines pose to the health and safety of patients in the United States and around the world.  It's a global issue.</p><p>As vice president of global security for Pfizer, I worked to mitigate the threat that counterfeit medicines pose to the health and safety of patients who rely on Pfizer medicines to live healthier and longer lives.  I commend the chairman, the ranking member and the committee, for cosponsoring the Stop Online Piracy Act, for their legislative effort.  It's a positive step forward in our fight against counterfeit medicines.</p><p>Counterfeit medicines pose a threat because of the conditions under which they are manufactured, in unlicensed, unregulated sites, frequently under unsanitary conditions.  In many instances they contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in authentic medicine, or in incorrect dosages, depriving patients of the therapeutic benefits of the -- of the medicine prescribed by their physicians.  In others they may contain toxic ingredients such as heavy metals, arsenic, pesticides, rat poison, brick dust, floor wax, leaded highway paints and even sheetrock or wallboard.</p><p>Counterfeit medicines are a global problem.  I'm pleased to share our experience in combating them and how the Stop Online Piracy Act aims to strengthen the U.S. arsenal.  Pfizer has implemented an aggressive anti-counterfeiting campaign that attacks counterfeits at their source.  Since 2004, we've prevented more than 138 million dosages of counterfeit Pfizer medicines alone, more than 68 million finished dosages and enough active pharmaceutical ingredient to manufacture another 70 million from reaching global patients. Additional raids by law enforcement, based on evidence we have provided, have also resulted in seizures of millions of dosages of counterfeits marketed by other major pharmaceutical companies.  In the United States we work closely with ICE, the FBI and FDA on their investigations, and with Customs and Border Protection to improve their ability to prevent counterfeit Pfizer medicines from reaching U.S. patients.  While the true scope of the counterfeit problems is hard to estimate, we have confirmed that counterfeit Pfizer medicines have been found and seized in at least 101 countries, and have breached the supply chains in 53 countries.</p><p>Technology has created a new front in this battle.</p><p>Today, the major threat to patients in the  U.S. are the many professional looking websites that promise safe, FDA-approved branded medicines from Canada or the U.K.  And for that reason we appreciate the chairman and ranking member's focus on the threat in Title I of the bill.  Giving the attorney general new tools and incentivizing private stakeholders to act against rogue websites, with immunity in place for every stakeholder's action, would be an important step forward.</p><p>Patients don't realize that many of the websites don't disclose the true source of the products they dispense, or even where their -- the alleged dispensing online pharmacy is located.  In such instances the World Health Organization has estimated that patients have more than a 50 percent change of receiving a counterfeit medicine.  I happen to believe that's a very low estimate.</p><p>I'd like to share two short case studies.  The first is RxNorth. Patients who visited RxNorth's website say -- thought they were ordering from a Canadian pharmacy and would receive authentic FDA- approved medicines.  In reality the medicines dispensed from RxNorth were traced from China, where they were manufactured, through Hong Kong, on to Dubai and to the UK where they were intercepted.  Among the medicines seized by UK customs were Lipitor, found to contain only 82 to 86 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, which is an incredibly high number for most counterfeits, as well as counterfeit versions of medicines from four other companies, including one to -- found to contain traces of metal.</p><p>Second is the case of Kevin Xu, convicted of misbranding drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods.  It demonstrates how attractive a target the U.S. supply chain is for those who counterfeit our medicines and how weak our current penalties for counterfeiting medicine are.  During meetings with our undercover consultant Xu boasted of the global scope of his criminal enterprise.  He offered a list of branded counterfeit medicines that he could provide, including five Pfizer medicines.  The evidence we gathered was shared with an ongoing ICE investigation of Xu.  An order placed by an ICE undercover agent was filled with only -- with a counterfeit.  When the tablets were tested, they were found to contain only an insignificant level of the active pharmaceutical ingredient found in the authentic medicine. Xu was sentenced to just 78 months in federal prison without parole, the maximum sentence under the applicable U.S. Sentencing Commission guideline range.  This punishment does not reflect the seriousness of the crime.  The Stop Online Piracy Act takes a positive toward making these penalties even tougher.</p><p>Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low-risk, high-profit criminal activity that has attracted drug traffickers, firearms smugglers and terrorists.  One of the principle players in the 2003 Lipitor breach here in the U.S. was a convicted cocaine trafficker.  In 2006, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan announced the indictment of 19 people who gave a portion of their profits from the sale of counterfeit Viagra to Hezbollah.</p><p>Those who counterfeit medicines are confident that even if caught, they'll get just a slap on the wrist.  Even here in the U.S. the maximum sentence imposed under the Food and Drug Cosmetics Act is just three years.  Recognizing the inherent risk that any counterfeit medicine poses to patients, we must enhance the penalties for pharmaceutical counterfeiting to provide a greater deterrent. Expedited procedures must be in place to shut down rogue websites dispensing counterfeit medicines to the U.S.</p><p>The Stop Online Piracy Act is a significant step forward in those efforts, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for introducing this important piece of legislation.  I'd like to work with you so that our laws recognize the grave health and safety risks posed by counterfeit medicines and serve as a deterrent.</p><p>I work with foreign government representatives in the global fight against counterfeiting.  It's hypocritical for us to speak with foreign government representatives, as I often do, about their lack of effective legislation when U.S. law is still lacking.  This bill, if enacted with strong penalties and mechanisms to shut down rogue websites, will be highly effective in our global argument for all governments to fully appreciate the serious health and safety aspects of this problem and encourage similar efforts around the world.</p><p>Thank you again for this opportunity to express my views.  For Pfizer pharmaceutical counterfeiting is first and foremost an issue of patient health and safety.  We look forward to working with you on the global fight against counterfeit medicine.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Clark.</p><p>Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>MICHAEL O'Leary:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Watt, distinguished members of the committee.  I'm honored to be here, and thank you for holding this important hearing.  Also want to thank you for introducing this legislation which will help protect American creativity and American jobs from thieves who hide overseas and seek to profit off the hard work of people in this country.</p><p>I also want to acknowledge my fellow panelists.  I'm pleased to be here with all of them today and look forward to working with them throughout this process.  I want to particularly acknowledge the contributions of Ms. Kirkpatrick and MasterCard.  As the chairman alluded to earlier, they are truly a fine example of a corporation trying to make the Internet a safe marketplace for people all over the world, and frankly their example is one to be followed.</p><p>Critics would have you, as Mr. Watt alluded to, believe that this is a battle between two giant corporations, and there's certainly a lot of truth to that.  But I'm also very proud to be part of a wide- ranging coalition that includes the AFL-CIO, who we'll hear from shortly, members of the Chamber of Commerce, big business, small business, individual creators and entrepreneurs.  So I think critics would have you believe that this bill is really about supporting Hollywood and things like that.  But the truth of the matter, when you look behind the rhetoric and the hyperbole, is that it goes -- intellectual property is something which affects every facet of the American economy, and it affects people all over the country.</p><p>In the case of the industry that I represent, the American Motion Picture and Television Industry, we believe that these jobs are worth protecting.  They're more fully detailed in my written testimony, but I would just mention a few.  They're people like Dan Lemieux, who's a stunt coordinator from Michigan.  He's worked on numerous films, television shows like Nip/Tuck, The Shield.  The industry includes over 95,000 small businesses.  They employ ten people or less. Businesses like Fletcher Camera, which is in Chicago -- they have 25 employees in that small business, and they provide movie equipment for productions that occur all over the -- all over the Midwest.  There are hundreds of thousands of businesses that provide services to productions.  There's a small paint and decorating firm in Baltimore, Maryland.  It's a fifth-generation family-run operation, and it has supplied paint for virtually every major production which has occurred in the Mid-Atlantic region over the past few years.</p><p>I want to be very clear with this committee that hard work, innovation and creativity are not solely the province of people who live in Northern California.  There are people all over this country who contribute to the economy every day, who contribute to our culture, who contribute to what we make creatively, and their jobs are just as important and just as worth protecting as anyone else's.  And that's why we think this bill is so important, because it's a positive step in that direction.</p><p>In this economic climate we simply cannot afford to turn our back on any industry which is coming forward and producing things that are -- that we can take all over the world and be successful with.  Our industry competes.  When we are given an opportunity to compete globally, we succeed.  Where we have trouble, frankly, Mr. Chairman, is where we don't have an opportunity to compete fairly.  And one of the problems we have is competing with people who are trying to steal our stuff.  We're not before the Congress looking for a handout or a bailout.  We're simply asking for an opportunity to stop people from stealing the products that we make.</p><p>In recent weeks you've heard a lot of spurious arguments about this legislation -- they've been chronicled in a number of the opening remarks -- that it violates the First Amendment, that it undermines existing content protection law, that it somehow stifles innovation, and that it will, yes, break the Internet.</p><p>The irony, of course, of that argument is that I believe it was first heard -- it was first raised by those opposing the DMCA many years ago, as the chairman will recall, and I believe some of those same people are here today opposing this bill because they think it will undermine the DMCA.  So there's a bit of irony there which seems to be lost inside the Beltway, but I suspect that outside the Beltway people see it for what it is.  These allegations that you're hearing are simply taken from the playbook of those people who have consistently opposed every effort that the Congress has come forward with in the last few years to protect intellectual property.</p><p>The good news is that every time Congress protects intellectual property the Internet flourishes.  Every time the United States stands up for legitimacy over illegitimacy the Internet gets bigger and stronger.  More things are available to consumers.  More products are available to consumers.  We make more movies.  They see more television.  Protecting legitimacy is a positive thing for the economy and for innovation.  And people that tell you otherwise are wrong. They've been when they've been raising these arguments for the past two decades, and they're wrong in the context of this bill.</p><p>What you understand so clearly, Mr. Chairman, is that the Stop Online Piracy -- and the Stop Online Piracy Act reflects this -- is that there is a very great difference between the legitimate marketplace and the illicit sites and services that we are talking about.  The legitimate market is protected against the threat -- when the legitimate market is protected against the threat of online theft, the only people who lose are those that do not work, take no risk, make no investment.  Instead, those are the people that simply try to profit off the hard work of others.</p><p>We've also heard arguments that Congress should limit its approach to the threat of rogue sites to, quote, \"following the money.\"  It's worth noting that whoever usually makes that argument is really saying you should follow someone else's money.  If we are in fact going to follow the money, which is something we should do, we should follow all of the money, not just some of it.</p><p>Piracy is a complex problem that can't be fixed with piecemeal solutions.  But this bill is an important first step in trying to deal with what is a very real and growing threat.  This is fundamentally about jobs and about protecting the jobs that Americans have creating products that are enjoyed all over the world.</p><p>Ultimately, someone once said that to lead is to choose.  And the bill, Mr. Chairman, that you put before the Congress in this debate is one which provides a number of choices.  It's a choice between illegal and legitimate.  It's a choice between a safe, vibrant Internet for everyone and a black-market Internet.  It's a -- it's a choice between protecting American creativity and jobs or protecting thieves.  These are simple choices from our perspective.  And with the leadership that's been provided by this committee we look forward to this process in debating this bill, putting something on the president's desk that both Republicans and Democrats can support, and at the end of the day will allow these hardworking Americans to keep their job and keep creating the products that the world enjoys.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>Ms. Kirkpatrick.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK:  Thank you.  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers and members of the committee.  My name is Linda Kirkpatrick and I am group head, Franchise Development/Customer Performance Integrity at MasterCard wide -- Worldwide in Purchase, New York.  MasterCard commends the committee on its attention to the issue of Internet-based infringement, including the work that went into H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act.  We greatly appreciate the opportunity to be here today and look forward to working with you to combat this critical issue.</p><p>MasterCard's rules and requirements prohibit the use of its system for any illegal purposes, including for the sale of products or services that infringe on intellectual property rights.  MasterCard recognizes the important role it plays in combating this issue and has taken a number of steps that demonstrate its commitment to this important cause.  These efforts, which are discussed in my written testimony, include publishing the MasterCard Anti-Piracy Policy, which sets out the specific process by which MasterCard and rights holders can work together to identify and prevent the sale of infringing products or services; working with the White House's Office of U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the development of industry best practices to address online infringement; and the implementation and maintenance of MasterCard's Business Risk Assessment and Mitigation program, otherwise known as our BRAM program.</p><p>By way of background, MasterCard operates a global payment system that connects over one billion cardholders and millions of merchants worldwide to complete MasterCard-branded payment transactions. MasterCard neither issues payment cards to cardholders, nor does it contract with merchants to accept payment cards.  Rather, MasterCard's financial institution customers issue payment cards to cardholders and/or contract with merchants to accept the cards.  The card-issuing customers are known as issuers.  Those customers that contract with merchants for card acceptance are commonly called acquirers.  Each cardholder's account relationship is with the issuer that issued the card to the cardholder, and each merchant's acceptance relationship is with its acquirer.</p><p>MasterCard has a long history of working with law enforcement, private stakeholders, its customers and others to address illegal or otherwise brand-damaging activities that may involve the MasterCard payment system or the unauthorized use of our widely recognized family of payment brands.  Our commitment to working with rights holders to prevent the MasterCard system from being used to facilitate online infringement is evidenced by our industry-leading anti-piracy policy, which is publicly available on our Internet site.</p><p>In accordance with that policy, MasterCard has established procedures that apply when a law enforcement entity or rights holder brings to MasterCard's attention evidence of alleged infringement.  We have established an email address for the submission of such requests and a set of information requirements for such requests, which are largely similar to the information required of rights holders in H.R. 3261.  The process we have implemented was developed collaboratively through strong working relationships with rights holders and their trade associations, and has led to the investigation of thousands of Internet sites and the termination of hundreds of rogue merchants.</p><p>MasterCard has also worked closely with the White House's Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the development of the best practices document to address online infringement.  Development of the best practices document involved input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including numerous representatives from the rights holder community, payment networks and other parties involved in online commerce.  The best practices are designed to assist rights holders in protecting their intellectual property through a voluntary system, and in no way diminish the ability of rights holders to take independent action to enforce their intellectual property rights.</p><p>Our Business Risk Assessment and Mitigation program, or BRAM program, is another key component of MasterCard's corporate efforts to preserve the integrity of the MasterCard payment system and protect against illegal and brand-damaging transactions.  More specifically, the BRAM program serves to restrict access to the MasterCard system by merchants whose products and services may pose significant fraud, regulatory or legal risks.  The BRAM program was created to enforce MasterCard rules prohibiting acquirers from engaging in or supporting any merchant activity that is illegal or that may damage the goodwill of MasterCard or reflect negatively on the MasterCard brand.  Merchant activities that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of another are expressly covered under the protocols of the BRAM program.</p><p>MasterCard is fully committed to continuing to address this important issue.  As the committee moves forward with legislation, MasterCard believes it is essential to ensure that any obligations imposed on payment systems are capable of being readily implemented through reasonable policies and procedures, and that payment systems be shielded from litigation and liability when acting in accordance with the bill's requirements.  In my written testimony we have offered a few general comments on the bill along those lines that we believe are consistent with the committee's objectives.</p><p>I look forward to answering any questions that you may have. Thank you.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  And thank you, Ms. Kirkpatrick.</p><p>And Ms. Oyama.</p><p>KATHERINE OYAMA:  Thank you.  Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Conyers, members of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today, not just on behalf of Google, but also on behalf of the Consumer Electronics Association, CCIA, NetCoalition, TechNet, TechAmerica, which together represent thousands of companies.</p><p>Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously.  We devote our best engineering talent and tens of millions of dollars every year to fight it.  In the last year alone we have spent more than $60 million to weed out bad actors from our ad services.  We have shut down nearly 150,000 AdWords accounts mostly based on our own detection efforts, and so far this year we've processed five million DMCA takedown requests, targeting nearly five million items.</p><p>We are as motivated as anyone to get this right, but the Stop Online Piracy Act is not the right approach.  SOPA would undermine the legal, commercial and cultural architecture that has propelled the extraordinary growth of Internet commerce over the past decade, a sector that has grown to $2 trillion in annual USGDP, including 300 billion (dollars) from online advertising.  Virtually every major Internet company from Twitter to Facebook, Yahoo and eBay, as well as diverse array of other groups from venture capitalists to librarians to musicians, have expressed serious concerns about this bill.</p><p>Unfortunately, this legislation is over broad.  It undermines the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has for more than a decade struck a balance.  The DMCA provides copyright owners with immediate recourse when they discover infringement online while also giving service providers the certainty that they need to invest in the products on which millions of Americans rely.  The bill sweeps in innocent websites that have violated no law.  It imposes harsh and arbitrary sanctions without due process.</p><p>The following example shows how the bill as currently written would work.  Imagine a website.  Let's call it Dave's Online Emporium, which enables small businesses to sell clothing and accessories.  More than 99 percent of the sellers on Dave's Emporium are entirely legitimate, but unbeknownst to Dave one seller has started selling counterfeit bags and T-shirts that parody a copyrighted design. Dave's Emporium takes great care to comply with copyright laws, including take-down procedures, including repeat infringement provisions of the DMCA.  But under the Stop Online Piracy Act the entire site could be deemed, quote, \"dedicated to theft based on the violations of this single seller,\" and the whole business effectively shut down.</p><p>Just about any private party, a corporation, a copyright troll, someone with an ax to grind, could send a notice to payment and advertising companies to terminate services to the site without first involving law enforcement or triggering any judicial process.  The complaining party has no duty to contact Dave's Emporium directly to resolve the issue before going straight to ads and payment services to terminate his service.  If the Emporium fails to respond with a counter notice within five days, Dave's site could effectively be put out of business.</p><p>Facing these potential risks, Dave might think twice about establishing his online emporium in the first place.  Countless websites of all kinds, commercial, social, personal, could be shuttered or put out of business based on allegations that may or may not be valid, and the resulting cloud of legal uncertainty would threaten new investment, entrepreneurship and innovation.  In a new study of venture capitalists released today, more than 80 percent said that the safe harbor provisions of digital copyright laws are essential.  Weakening those safe harbor provisions would have a recession-like impact on new investment.</p><p>And at the same time this proposed law imposes new and unclear obligations on Internet service providers to take, quote, \"technically feasible and reasonable measures to block access to sites, to remove them from search results, turning these providers into de facto web sensors.  This won't work.  As long as there's money to be made pushing pirated and counterfeit products, tech savvy criminals around the world will find ways to sell these products online, and ordering ISPs and search engines to disappear websites from the Internet will not change this fundamental reality.</p><p>We urge you instead to target the problem at the source.  Shut down illegal foreign sites by cutting off their revenue.  We support legislation that builds on the DMCA.  Our proposal would empower the Justice Department to target foreign sites that violate current law, and a court could then order advertisers and payment services in which our services would be included to cut off ads and payments to those sites.  Google has been working with the committee on such a solution for over six months, and we will continue to do so.  When all is said and done, we must address online piracy effectively in ways that continue to allow the Internet to drive this economy and this country forward.  Thank you.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Oyama.</p><p>Mr. Almeida.</p><p>PAUL ALMEIDA:  Good morning, Chairman Smith, Ranking Members Conyers and distinguished members of the committee.  My name is Paul Almeida.  I'm the president of the Department for Professional Employees, a coalition of 22 national unions affiliated with the AFL- CIO.  I am honored to speak today on behalf of the four million professional and technical people whom our affiliated unions represent.  Those people include creators, performers and craftspeople in arts, entertainment and media, professional and technical people in education, health care and public administration in aerospace and other manufacturing, in pharmaceuticals, science, engineering, information technology and in professional sports.</p><p>The people I represent work in a wide range of occupations and industries.  They share a wide range of interests as workers and consumers as well as ardent defenders of the First Amendment.  On their behalf, permit me to commend you and thank you.  Their unions unanimously support the Stop Online Piracy Act, as does the entire AFL-CIO.  My message is simple.  It has three parts.  First, strengthening protections for U.S. intellectual property helps American workers, jobs, incomes and benefits.  Second, counterfeit goods endanger workers, both as workers and consumers.</p><p>Third, there is no inconsistency between protecting free speech and an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property.  If the United States allows a tax on intellectual property to go unanswered, it puts good livelihoods at risk.  Online access continues to accelerate and expand.  It increasingly displaces traditional models for distributing content and thus heightens the potential for digital theft.  Estimates of the number of jobs lost to digital theft in arts, entertainment and media sector alone run in the hundreds of thousands. Losses of income arise because entertainment professionals depend on compensation at two points.  First, when the professionals do the work, and later when -- the reuse of the intellectual property. Royalties and residuals from downstream revenues enable entertainment professionals to survive between projects.   In manufacturing, the estimates of losses from counterfeits also run in the billions. Again, the victims include workers who face lost jobs and income.  We should not allow rogue websites to facilitate the distribution of counterfeit goods.</p><p>My second point -- counterfeits endanger workers as workers and as consumers.  Only last week, the Senate Committee on Armed Services heard about an astonishing extent of counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain.  Counterfeits kill.  When protective vests are fake, soldiers and police officers can die.  When prescription drugs are fake, patients can due.  And when smoke detectors are fake, homeowners and firefighters can die.  In May, the Atlanta, Georgia Fire and Rescue Department recalled roughly 18,500 smoke detectors that it distributed for a free Atlanta smoke alarm program.  The smoke detectors were counterfeit and so were the underwriter laboratory seals.  An alert from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission noted, \"The unreliable counterfeit alarms pose a life safety hazard to the occupants in the event of a fire.\"</p><p>Counterfeit smoke detectors pose a life safety hazard not just to homeowners, but to fire fighters.</p><p>Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Firefighters, another union affiliated with DPE, wrote to Chairman Smith and Ranking Members Conyers to support the Stop Online Piracy Act.  President Schaitberger noted that \"the preparedness and safety of our members depends on reliable equipment.\" A blog called techdirt.com posted a defamatory response.  \"Who does the MPAA actually think it's fooling?  Is Congress so stupid that it can't figure out for itself that firefighters have no clue what the debate is about?\"  The blog accused firefighters of supporting censorship.  It implied the only reason the firefighters spoke up was because the MPAA was paying off the union.  Firefighters know the consequences of counterfeit equipment.</p><p>My third point -- freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet.  Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship.  The First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.  I mentioned earlier that the people whom I represent today include ardent defenders of the First Amendment, newspaper and broadcast journalists, radio broadcasters, news writers, script writers and many others in the arts and entertainment and media.  When they oppose wage theft, there is no inconsistency with the First Amendment.  Digital theft and rogue websites diminishes incentives to invest and leads to a downward spiral for U.S. workers in our economy.  That's the bad news.</p><p>The good news is that you are taking action.  The professional and technical workers and their unions whom I represent look forward to your passing the Stop Online Piracy Act.  Thank you.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Almeida.</p><p>I'll recognize myself for questions, and Ms. Pallante, let me direct a couple questions to you.  In your prepared written statement you said, quote, \"If Congress does nothing to provide serious responses to online piracy, the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail,\" end quote.  Now, what did you mean by that?</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I don't think that's an overstatement.  The system that we have for copyright and have had since 1790 is based on a system of exclusive rights, which authors can license and which publishers and producers can invest in and then distribute and otherwise bring to life for consumers, not only here, but through reciprocal agreements with foreign countries. If those exclusive rights cannot be meaningfully enforced and be usurped in a lawless environment, they will become meaningless.  And if Congress does not update the piracy laws, as it has done for -- consistently for many, many years, many decades, hundreds of years --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  I think you just anticipated my next question, which was going to be do you think the legal system has all the tools it needs now to combat the infringing websites.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  I don't.  I think that this is a timely hearing. I think Congress has done an excellent job of intervening when technology outpaces the law.  It did that in the NET Act.  It did that in the ART Act.  And I think that this is similar legislation.  We're looking at a situation where very sophisticated and very smart and very blatant infringers will leap to offshore locations so that they can direct infringing goods, which often belong to our companies, back to American consumers.  They're outside the jurisdiction of our courts.  We're not suggesting that we would intervene in domestic courts in foreign countries.  What we are saying is that we should have some response to allowing them to do that with impunity.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK, thank you, Ms. Pallante.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, let me direct a couple questions to you, and first, let me say that you spoke a lot of the right words today.  We've heard those words before.  And only hope that your company and other simpler -- other similar companies will practice what you preached, and that we will wait to see.  Let me ask you a couple questions.  You do acknowledge that there is a severe problem, I gather, with the theft of intellectual property by foreign criminals.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  That's a problem that we take extremely seriously. We have hundreds of employees that work on it.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  And I believe you agree that if we cut off access to American consumers and U.S. dollars that that will decrease the amount of intellectual property theft as well.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We've been cutting off the money as a very effective solution --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- (to cite ?) their own business because they profit.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK.  Now, in -- particularly regard to Google, do you think Google should stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a rights holder could come directly to Google, would not need to go to court, and they could alert us of the foreign infringement --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Well, I --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- and we would remove that -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  -- a lot of people don't think the DMCA is sufficient, including the Registrar of Copyrights.  Do you think we should go beyond that to try to stop returning the search results for foreign sites?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Thank you for the question.  I think there's a lot of misperception about what is and what's -- (inaudible 14:08).</p><p>REP. SMITH:  No, no, I was asking you a specific question here. Should Google stop returning search results for foreign sites that are breaking U.S. law?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We do when notified by rights holders.  We've done that more than five million times -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. SMITH:  So the answer is yes then.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK.  Thank you.  Another question is this.  Should Google stop placing ads on illegal sites that are stealing American intellectual property?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Our policies prohibit that.  We've proactively ejected more than 12,000 sites this year.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK, and so you would agree not to either facilitate nor place ads on illegal sites that are stealing U.S. property.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  If a site is violating the law, we would eject them from our system, and we do that.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK, again, I hope you can practice what you preach today.  That would be a major -- a major breakthrough.  It seems to me -- and let me just conclude in this way -- that Google and other companies really have a decision to make, and I hope they will make the right decision.  I hope they will decide to help other American companies.  It's not necessarily going to benefit Google or some of your allies.  But I hope you will decide to help American companies protect their intellectual property from being infringed by foreign criminals.  And that is, I know, a decision that you all are having to make and weigh.</p><p>I acknowledge and regret to a large extent that if you make the right decision that is going to mean you're going to have to give up some of the revenue you might get from some of those ads that are actually on the infringing websites themselves.  That's a decision for you all to make, but I think you can make the right one there.  I simply hope that you and others will decide to do what's good for American -- for other American companies, do what's good for American jobs and do what's good for the American economy as well.  But thank you for your testimony.</p><p>The gentleman from --</p><p>REP.      :  (Off mic.)</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, is recognized for -- (inaudible).</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HOWARD BERMAN (D-CA):  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Conyers.  And I'd like to thank the chairman for responding to my letter and inviting Google to testify. I think it's extremely important to understand what legitimate issues the opposition may have so they can be addressed.  I haven't heard concrete changes they would recommend.  I haven't received a Google proposal or suggested proposal on -- focusing on foreign rogue websites and would love to see it since it's apparently been discussed with the committee.</p><p>Opponents of legislation say we support the bill's stated goals and ask that sponsors consider more targeted ways to combat foreign rogue websites.  That's the response to every idea put forward to stop theft.  Why isn't this the time for the tech community to put forward concrete and specific proposals that will effectively combat the theft to take place on the Internet?  The rhetoric around this bill is over the top.  None of the sponsors of this bill are against the First Amendment.  None of the sponsors of this bill want to shut down the Internet, and none of the sponsors want to stymie technology.</p><p>Perhaps the first example that I'll focus on is opponents claiming that the legislation will undermine U.S. foreign policy and encourage repression by foreign governments.  I wrote Secretary Clinton and asked her opinion.  She clearly, forcefully -- she clearly and forcefully said, \"There is no contradiction between intellectual property rights protection and enforcement ensuring freedom of expression on the Internet.\"  In other words, we can adopt legislation like H.R. 3261 to better protect U.S. intellectual property online, at the same time demand that foreign governments respect Internet freedom.  And I'd like to submit those records -- those letters for the record.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Without objection.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  I'm going to -- based on your answers to Mr. Smith's question, I'd like to follow up.  I thought I heard you say in response to the chairman's question that Google does not link to pirate websites.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Under the DMCA procedures that Congress set out, a rights holder can notify Google about foreign infringement and we would remove -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  All right, well, explain to me this one.  The Pirate Bay is a notorious pirate site, a fact that its founders proudly proclaim in the name of the site itself.  In fact, the site's operators have been criminally convicted in Europe.  One has apparently fled to Cambodia.  It is being blocked by court order in at least Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Finland.  And yet Google continues to send U.S. customers, or at least -- I don't know what you're doing this morning, but before this morning -- because maybe you can read my mind -- U.S.Google continues to send U.S. consumers to the site by linking to the site in your search results.  Why do you do this, requiring copyright owners to send thousands upon thousands of notices for individual torrent links to the Pirate Bay only to have those same files reappear on the system when Google crawls the Pirate Bay again?</p><p>We all know that this is a notoriously egregious pirate site. Why does Google refuse to de-index the site in your search results?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Copyright infringement, counterfeiting -- these are issues that we take incredibly seriously.  We invest tens of millions of dollars into the problem.  We have hundreds of people around the world that work on it.  When it comes to copyright --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Why does Google refuse to de-index the site in your search results?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We will immediately, if we're notified by a rights holder -- we would remove the link from our search results to the Pirate Bay.  We've done that over five million times this year.  When it -- the copyright --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  So you remove the link to a particular item.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Exactly.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Why don't you refuse to de-index the site in your search results?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  The procedures that Congress set out under the DMCA ensure that today with websites --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Would it make sense to have a law that allowed you -- if that's -- if the DMCA doesn't go far enough -- a law that essentially told you that's what you should do in response to dealing with a clearly established rogue website that flaunts it in every possible way.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So we have no idea of knowing if a given search result is infringing or is authorized.  We do need the cooperation of the rights holder to let us know, and today we are removing links.  We think in terms of a legislative approach something that goes after the real incentive for those sites to be in business makes it so enhancing the DMCA and going after advertising, which is our services and payment providers, we think makes sense, because we think that the DMCA --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Well, could you -- could you draft some proposals that reflect that position --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Oh.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  -- so we could look at them?  I mean, I would love it if you and the Consumer Electronics Association and Public Knowledge and these groups would give us something specific.  You think this is -- it goes too far.  It's too (excessive ?).  Give us something specific.  Infuse yourself with the notion of you want to stop digital theft.  What works?  And use your brilliant minds that you have in your organizations to give us some specifics because the DMCA is not doing the job.  That's so obvious.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We are -- we are very interested in working with your staff, with the chairman and other members of the committee.  I do believe through Net Coalition we have provided that language and we'd be happy to follow up.  We do think, in terms of search results, that Congress got it right under the DMCA.  It leaves up legitimate content.  It takes down infringing content.  We want to make sure that when we're dealing with speech that we use a scalpel.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Well, my time is expired, but you cannot look at what is going on since the passage of the DMCA and say Congress got it just right.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We agree -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Maintain the status quo.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We certainly -- (inaudibl) --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  And the gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- would be useful.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Berman.</p><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Coble, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HOWARD COBLE (R-NC):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to have you all with us.  I've had to miss some of the hearing, Mr. Chairman, because of other meetings, but it's good to be here. I was going to examine Ms. Pallante, but the chairman beat me to it.  I was going to examine Ms. Oyama, but Mr. Berman beat me to it.  But I'll still try to recover.</p><p>Ms. Obama (sic), let me ask you this -- Ms. Oyama.  What relief does the DMCA offer to a trademark owner who is trying to prevent counterfeiters from selling fakes?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So for counterfeit, it's dealt with a little bit differently.  For counterfeit at Google we will act through our -- for our advertising.  We've ejected -- so, for example, for AdWords, we've ejected over 100,000 accounts in the last year.  There is a very kind of stark difference between copyright and trademark.  Congress so far has not enacted a DMCA for a trademark.  Copyright laws are exclusive rights.</p><p>Trademarks -- it depends on what geography you're in, right, what product you can use.  A given name, Pacific, can be used on lots of different products, and so I know there's been kind of a longstanding conversation about that issue.  Certainly, if we ever were to receive a court order about counterfeit and related to search, well, of course, we would comply with that court order.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I thank you.</p><p>Mr. Clark -- Mr. Clark, how involved are organized criminal networks in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit medicines?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  From my estimation and experience, it's a problem that's growing.  I don't think we've reached the level yet where we are seeing global cartels per se as we do in narcotics.  But as the notoriety of the crime gets around, the profit margins are so phenomenal and the penalties on a global scale are so low that it's a no-brainer for organized crime to look at this as a way to go.  So it is growing.  We've seen instances of it, not systemic instances, but we have seen -- as I decided (sic), the Detroit instance where money was going to Hezbollah.  We have seen drug traffickers.  But I think it's growing in that capacity.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  Mr. Clark, what aspects of SOPA do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  I apologize, Congressman.  I missed the first part of that.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  What aspects of SOPA, the bill before us that -- do you believe are particularly important to combating the problem of counterfeiting medicines?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  I think all aspects.  My biggest worry, Congressman, is that counterfeit medicines are still not perceived by the public, by law enforcement, by judiciary, our judges and prosecutors as a serious crime yet.  When you see somebody lie Kevin Xu who has a global reputation for supplying counterfeits -- it was my understanding during his undercover discussions he offered a list of counterfeit medicines, and yet he said if anything is on that list -- anything else off that list that you want, I can have it for you. Give me two weeks.  We're talking cancer medicines.  We're talking blood pressure medicines.  We're talking Alzheimer's medicines.</p><p>And I think when we see a few tablets here or there, we have a tendency not to think of the consequences those tablets bring.  A lot of people in the United States, I think, look at it and say there's no bodies in the street.  Nobody seems to be dying from counterfeit, so it can't be that serious of a crime.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I got you.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  But when you look at people -- if -- at best if they're getting 20 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicines that they're taking, such as -- this Alzheimer medicine that was manufactured in Turkey, manufactured in facilities such as this where there are no conditions that -- in terms of licensing, regulatory, environmental are applied.  Even with just 20 percent of the active ingredient, what's the other 80 percent?  And if there's nothing but benign chemicals in that 80 percent, they're still not going to get relieved of their disease and they eventually die.</p><p>So my biggest worry, Congressman, is that people are dying from these counterfeits.  We just haven't figured out a way to correlate --</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I got you.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  -- the deaths from counterfeits with the problem yet.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I thank you.  I want to beat the -- I want to beat that red light that will illuminate imminently and say to Ms. Kirkpatrick I am advised that MasterCard has been instrumental in combating piracy.  And Mr. Chairman, I think it should be noted for those who have combated -- particularly flagrant piracy that should be noted.  And I thank you all for being with us, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Coble.</p><p>The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watts, is recognized.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me start by thanking all of the witnesses for being here today.  This is a difficult issue. This legislation raises some interesting new challenges, but the circumstances are raising difficult new challenges.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, let me start with you because I want to be sure I understood your testimony.  I got the impression that you do not object strenuously to the provisions of Section 102 because they require a court order, that your primary objections are with respect to the provisions in 103 where private market-based system to protect customers are involved because they don't get -- it doesn't require giving notice to the site owner or whoever's put up the site.  Am I misstating where you are on that?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We'd certainly agree that concerns about 103 are the greatest, one, because of the scope of what -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. WATT:  Well, let me -- let me -- let me separate the question.  Do you have concerns with Section 102?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We would be -- the legislation we support --</p><p>REP. WATT:  Question is do you have concerns with Section --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  With some of the remedies, yes, the -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. WATT:  Some of the remedies, OK.  And you'll give us that in writing so that we can evaluate those concerns.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah.  The ads -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. WATT:  But your primary concerns are with Section 103.  Is that -- am I misstating that?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think if we got -- if we got the remedies right in 102 focused on ads and payments the way that these sites are making money --</p><p>REP. WATT:  I didn't -- I'm not trying to get you to resolve that issue about 102 today.  I'd rather have that in writing.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  It's much more workable, yes.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Yeah, right.  But your concerns about 103 have to do with the lack of notice to the site owner, right?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah, in part.  I think the --</p><p>REP. WATT:  OK, so do -- is there some effective way that we could give notice to the site owner that you are aware of, and if you could give me those suggestions in writing, because I  have those concerns too.  The problem is we don't -- we don't currently have an effective way, access to those -- to that information to give them notice.  And you do, I think, in your system because you put up the -- you put up the site.  OK.  Now, if you can help me with those two things, we'll be far down the road.  I'm not adverse to addressing your concerns.  I've indicated to that -- you -- to you both in private, and I'm saying it publicly today.</p><p>Let me talk about this constitutional standard that -- and make sure that I understand where you are on that, because you appear to be advocating a constitutional standard that would prohibit the enforcement of any laws online.  In your written testimony you disagree with Professor Abrams' conclusion that it is constitutional to block access to a website that is primarily infringing even though such blocking may incidentally impact protected speech.  Your written testimony won't concede that -- blocking a website that is almost entirely infringing would be -- would be constitutional.  And you've confirmed that in what you've just said verbally here.  Does that mean that you consider it unconstitutional for law enforcement to seize a child pornography site if the site also contains one copy of the King James Bible?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So the speech concerns that have been raised --</p><p>REP. WATT:  Just answer that question for me and then I'll go forward from there.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  There are certainly legitimate --</p><p>REP. WATT:  What about if it contains 20 copies of the King James Bible but it's still 90 percent child pornography?  Are you saying First Amendment rights won't allow us to do that?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think we agree with Floyd Abrams that you need to look at the whole site.  You need to make sure that it's really dedicated to infringement, and when you're (running ?) legitimate speech, it does -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. WATT:  OK, well -- and probably cause would require the Attorney General's Office to do that.  I mean, he's not going to go and cite you unless -- or start this process unless he's gone through that analysis.  The question is do you think that there's something unconstitutional about taking down a site that is overwhelmingly primarily devoted to stolen products?  And I -- you know, if that's -- if that's your position, I think we're going to have a real problem with that.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  No, I think if there was a site out there that was 100 percent terrible, that's a separate issue.  The definition of --</p><p>REP. WATT:  No, I'm saying 90 percent terrible.  I'm saying 98 percent terrible.  Is it -- is 2 percent going to save this site from being taken down?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I don't think there's an exact number.  I think when you are sweeping in vast majorities of legitimate speech without notice, that raises significant (questions ? 3:49) --</p><p>REP. WATT:  Is that 51 percent, or is it 60 percent, or -- I mean, how are we going to do this?  You're telling me I can't violate somebody's constitutional right if it incidentally adversely impacts their protected rights.  That's what you're saying.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  No, I think if a site was primarily dedicated to infringement there's a lot of tools that -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. WATT:  OK, well, that's what the bill says, isn't it?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Well, we would not agree that the scope of the definition captures totally infringing sites.  We have a lot of concerns that it -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. WATT:  No, I didn't say totally infringing.  That's not what you said either.  That's not what you said.  You said primarily infringing.  And then all of a sudden you shifted over to totally infringing.  Is this a question about whether something is totally infringing or primarily infringing, or do you think that both of them are -- that one should be protected and one should not be protected?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think a definition that was, you know, narrowly drawn that had something like primarily would be helpful.</p><p>REP. WATT:  OK, so you're going to give us some language on that.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  (Inaudible.)</p><p>REP. WATT:  My time is up.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We have a definitional --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Chairman's time has expired.  Thank you, Mr. Watt.</p><p>The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte, is recognized.</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, I want to pursue that line of questioning.  Years ago former Chairman Henry Hyde put me in a room with about 30 government representatives from the content industry, from the online industry Internet service providers and a few that had a foot in both camps, and we worked for months in a -- in a hot room and came to agreement on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and in particular, the notice and take-down provisions, which you have spoken highly of.  And I agree with you that those provisions still have a role in protecting online copyright, but the Internet has changed dramatically since then.  The speeds have accelerated.  The technology is more sophisticated.  Search engines are more sophisticated.  And the criminals who use all of that to rip off legitimate businesses of all kinds are more sophisticated.</p><p>So as you know and as I've said, I'm interested in making sure that this legislation gives effective tools to combat lawbreakers but to also ensure it does not entangle legitimate online businesses or the ability of entrepreneurs to continue to bring exciting new products and services to the Internet.  Can you tell the committee the top concerns the tech community has about the bill and your specific recommendations on how to fix those concerns within the bill?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure, thank you.  I think when the conversations started the idea was to target foreign rogue sites, sites that were clearly breaking the law and to introduce -- build on the DMCA, introduce new, harsh remedies.  That is definitely approach that we would get behind, that we would support.  I think when the tech community now is looking at this language, there are serious concerns that the definition of a site that's dedicated to the theft of U.S. property, you know, probably purely unintentionally -- it sweeps in a great amount of lawful websites.  So, for example, the unit of analysis for what the site is -- there's some language in there that says an Internet site or a portion thereof.  So there's some concern about whether we're looking at the whole site, or are we just looking at one blog, one tweet, one comment, one page on a site?</p><p>So getting the definition right would be really important. There's other words within the definition that seem to introduce notions like facilitate.  That's one of the reasons why the Consumer Electronics Association who I mentioned -- they have serious concerns because they manufacture so many different devices.  Somebody could say that the Internet itself facilitates infringement.  So we need to make sure that we're really -- we're really staying within the existing confines of copyright law.  I would also mention in the definition there's some language -- you can be dedicated to theft if you have -- no one understands, sir, what this means if you have taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of your site for infringement.</p><p>Right now small-business owners -- when they're starting a website, they know if they comply with the DMCA.  They are lawful companies.  They can seek investment.  They can go forward.  If they have to somehow subscribe to that kind of definition, the folks that we're hearing from -- they just have no idea how they would even possibly build their site to set that definition.  So I think getting the scope of what is a site dedicated to infringement would be critical.  And from there we're certainly more than happy to work on remedies.  The two that we think are really smart -- if you look at WikiLeaks, think this is a good example of the fact that this is a strong remedy -- is choking these sites off at their revenue source. They are in business because they can either sell advertising or because they can profit from subscribers.  If you could get the entire industry together and you could choke off advertising and you could choke off payments to those sites, you would be incredibly effective without introducing the collateral damage that we had discussed to free speech or to Internet architecture, things like that.</p><p>So ensuring that we had the right remedies and the right scope -- I think there's plenty of opportunity for all players, for a cross- section of industry to come together.</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  Let me -- let me just follow up on that.  The more detailed information you give us, the better our ability to address legitimate concerns.  So will you commit to working with me to identify the specific problems that the tech community has with the bill and working to address those specific problems to improve the bill as we move forward?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Absolutely.</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  And some have argued that this legislation would break the Internet.</p><p>As the co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, that's the last thing I want to do.  Can you explain exactly how this legislation would impact the functioning of the Internet?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So I think -- I think the major concerns that have been raised -- really kind of in the cyber security field.  So there's a white paper by a group of engineers who designed DNS-SEC.  There are some other leading cyber security folks who have spoken out about it. I think -- I think Stewart Baker has been on record.  he's a former senior official at DHS and the former general council of the NSA.  One of the provisions in the bill would require ISPs to perform DNS blocking.  There's kind of a twofold concern there.  One is that the methods proposed here are not compatible with a more than ten-year long effort in the cyber security field to implement DNS-SEC in a way that would prevent cyber security attacks.</p><p>So I am not the cyber security expert -- the -- but the folks that wrote that code are saying that this will really harm the U.S. and the global effort to make DNS more secure.  I think the second piece is we know that users, unfortunately, are seeking this material. We can predict that there are going to be circumvention efforts.  And so there's a big concern that if we place certain obligations on U.S. DNS providers that users are going to reroute their traffic to offshore rogue providers, and the vulnerabilities that an offshore rogue provider could introduce into the network, not just for the kid that's looking for the movie or for some bad actor, but for anyone whose network that their on, is really significant.  It could introduce spyware, malware, privacy concerns.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman's --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I know this is, you know, something that really the folks who are the experts in this field have raised, but, you know, that's been kind of a critical concern about --</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  Ms. Oyama, I hate to interrupt, but I do believe that Mr. Clark -- if the chairman will permit -- Mr. Clark from his past experience with the Department of Justice might also be able to comment on this issue, if the chairman would allow.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Mr. Clark, could you give a very brief response?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Very briefly, I -- unfortunately, I don't have the cyber experience.  It wasn't one of the areas I actually worked myself.  I've managed it.  I don't know the intricacies about it, though, in all honestly, so I apologize for not having an answer for that.</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  Well, I apologize, Mr. Chairman.  I thought --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  (Thank you ? 12:14)</p><p>REP. GOODLATTE:  -- there was an opportunity there, but perhaps not.  Ms. Oyama, thank you.  We look forward to working with you.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Goodlatte.</p><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Before my questions, I would like to ask unanimous consent to introduce a number of items into the record, opposition to the provisions of the bill.  The letters are from the Consumer Union and other consumer groups, Tech Net, Tech America, the American Library Association, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Human Rights Watch, other public interest groups, dozens of human rights groups around the world, a written statement from the ACLU, a paper from the Brooking Institute explaining how the bill would undermine security and stability of the Internet, a white paper by five leading DNS engineers and Internet security experts, a letter from the Anti-fishing Working Group, an article from Stewart Baker, the former general counsel of the NSA and policy chief for DHS under the Bush administration entitled, \"Copyright Bills Could Kill Hopes for Secure Net,\" a letter signed by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Google, Mozilla and Zinga, and a Harvard Business Review article entitled, \"Great Firewall of America.\"</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Without objection.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  You know, I think some today have sort of written off, I think, serious criticisms of this bill as hyperbole and that the only objection is about money and hyperbole.  And I just don't think that's the case.  The big tech companies weren't the ones who said this bill would cause the U.S. to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet.  That's from dozens of human rights groups around the world.  The big tech companies weren't the ones who wrote the -- that the bill has the potential to do consumers more harm than good.  That's from the Consumer's Union and other nonprofit consumer groups.  The big tech companies didn't write that the bill is in conflict with the First Amendment.  That's from the ACLU and over 100 law professors.</p><p>It wasn't the big tech companies who said the bill -- kill our best hope of securing the Internet.  No, that's from Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary for DHS and the former general council of the National Security Agency.  Dozens of venture capitalists, not big tech companies, wrote that the bill will stifle investment in Internet services, throttle innovation and hurt American competitiveness.  And it hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those in industries that we're going to regulate.  And these are just a few of the examples.</p><p>Now, I understand why cosponsors of the legislation are not happy about widespread criticism of the bill.  But I think impugning the motives of the critics rather than engaging in the substance is a mistake.  I have a number of questions, and I note that, you know, we've got six witnesses here.  Five are in favor and only one is against -- and that troubles me.  I'll just say that.  You know, I don't think it's a balanced effort, and I'm sorry that we don't have any technical expertise on this panel in terms of engineering talent, because I think that is an important issue as to the DNS blocking portions of the bill.</p><p>So let me ask a question of Mr. O'Leary.  Do you believe that software programs should be illegal if they allow a user to circumvent Internet filtering ordered by the government?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  I don't believe that software programs should be per se illegal.  I think if people misuse them, then they should be -- if they misuse any product in violation of the law, they should -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  So the ability to just simply circumvent the take- down order as a software add-on to a browser should continue to be a legal -- a legal thing.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, no, if you're saying you're building something in specifically to avoid an order of the court, not to do something, I do have a problem with that.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  So you think that software ought to be illegal.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, that's not what I said, no.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, it's one or the other.  Either you should be able to do that or you shouldn't be able to do it.  Which is it?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Does the software have a legitimate purpose or is it simply to circumvent a court order?</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, circumventing software can be a multiplicity of these.  For example --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Right, but in your question you said the software would be created to allow circumvention.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  There is a -- there's an add-on to Firefox that will allow --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  I think that most legitimate companies in the United States, including Firefox, should abide by court orders and follow the law.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, you're not really answering the question.  I will take from you -- you think that that ought to be regulated at least.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Regulated in much the same way that we regulate people driving drunk and stealing things.</p><p>Yeah, I think that -- I know that the word regulation has --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Let me -- let me ask you this, because I don't have a long time and I assume that you were directing your comments -- that people didn't -- that northern California people didn't care about jobs in the rest of America, either to myself or Mr. Lungren, since we're the only members of the committee from northern California.  I will say I do care about jobs all over America, and, in fact, eBay, which is headquartered in San Jose, has enabled thousands of Americans all over the country to form small businesses and to use the Internet to sell products.</p><p>I'd like to know your concept of -- you think that this is a big problem and I think it's a problem.  I think it's that Internet piracy is something that is troubling, it's illegal, and I think we need to do something about it.  So let me just put that out there.  How many sites do you think need to be shut down in order to say we've succeeded in the fight against Internet privacy?  Is it a dozen?  Is it hundreds?  Is it thousands?  Do you have any idea the scope or the number of sites that need to be (removed ? 18:32).</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, I think, first of all, you mischaracterized my comment about northern California and I'd like to correct the record on that.  I was simply (making the point -- ? 18:38)</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, do it later because I don't have that much time.  (Laughs.)  Answer my question, if you would.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Actually, the gentlewoman's time has expired, but you're free to answer the question.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Thank you.  The comment about northern California was in the context of this debate.  The perception has been created by opponents of this bill that all of the innovation and all of the creative thinking comes out of -- out of Silicon Valley.  I was not taking umbrage with anyone in Silicon Valley.  We have great relationships with a lot of people in Silicon Valley.  Pixar, which makes wonderful movies, is in Silicon Valley.  Apple, which is a legitimate online retailer, is in Silicon Valley.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  But --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  But I was also making the simple point, Congresswoman, that there are people all over this country in places like Detroit, Baltimore, Texas, North Carolina --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Mr. Chairman, I wonder, since --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Gentlewoman's --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  But I'm happy to answer your question -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  May I have an additional 30 seconds?</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Will the gentleman answer the question very briefly?</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  How many sites?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, I know for a fact that we can start with Pirate Bay, which was mentioned earlier.  I do not know how many -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  So is it just Pirate Bay, do you think, or is it a dozen?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  No.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Is it a thousand?  What do you think?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  It would be easier to answer the question if I was allowed to.  There are multiple sites out there.  This is a legitimate problem.  We have been very clear, and we will continue to be clear, that there is no silver bullet.  The problem is involving and changing.  I cannot sit here right now and tell you in good faith that I know what that number is.  But what I do know is that there are literally hundreds of sights out there that are engaging in this activity, and all you need to do that --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Do you think it's in the -- (inaudible)?</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Gentlewoman's time --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  -- (inaudible) -- know that is to go to Google and type in J. Edgar, and you will get a list of page after page after page --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Or if I do -- or Bing or any of them.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  -- of sites that are engaging in this illegal activity.  (Inaudible) --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  So it's hundreds of thousands.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentlewoman's time has expired, but let me remind members that they're welcome to submit written questions to any of the panelists, and we'll try to get those answers to the members quickly as we can.</p><p>The gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DARRELL ISSA (R-CA):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the gentlelady from the north -- while I am deep in the confederacy of California -- went through quite a litany of good opponents to the bill.  I'd like to add to that by unanimous consent the following: a joint letter by 160 entrepreneurs, founders and CEOs and executives, a letter expressing concern about SOPA from the Digital Media Association, a statement by the Consumer Electronics Association -- Electronics Association which was denied an opportunity to be here as a witness, a letter signed by 53 venture capitalists expressing concern regarding the PROTECT Act, and a transcript of recent remarks made by Vice President Joe Biden that he gave in -- at the London Cyber Security Conference germane to his concerns about this bill.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Without objection.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I've been the victim of piracy, so you're not going to have a problem with me agreeing with the problem.  Hardware, software -- you've got it all.  But Mr. Clark, I'm going to hope that you can stretch for this part of it even though it's not in your title.  You're familiar with the ITC, aren't you?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Yes, I am.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Pfizer regularly -- for patent infringement on imported products would go the ITC and get relatively quick justice using administrative law judges available to them and injunctive relief against a patent violator, correct?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Outside of my field, but I would believe that'd be the case.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  So when we deal with rogue elements outside the jurisdiction of the United States that are importing in the United States, we have a history of an organization that is quick, administrative and can have continued jurisdiction against non-U.S. entities who are, in fact, trying to take what they have stolen and sell it into America.  Is that -- you -- correct to your understanding?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Generally speaking, yes.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  OK, have any of the other -- of you -- just raise your hands -- worked with the ITC in your background or are familiar with them?  One other.  Well, let me just run through quickly because time will be very limited and questions seem to be -- the answers seem to be long.  We have a court of jurisdiction.  Now, they do not specifically have the mandate to follow the money and to provide injunctive relief against Google, eBay, or anybody else after they find an offshore infringer and seek remedies, but they have their own councils.  They have administrative law judges.  They have a procedure.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I object to this bill in its current form mostly because I believe it fails to use tools that are generally better than the tools that we have at our disposal in this bill, and I believe that if the real remedy sought is, in fact, a court of continued jurisdiction specializing in intellectual property and designed to, in fact, reach a quick solution to a question of whether there is wrongdoing, and then follow the money through injunction, not through fines, and, obviously, a criminal referral, my intention is to offer legislation on a bipartisan basis that will, in fact, look at the legitimate concerns, take a great deal of these 80 pages -- however -- and this is where it's tough, Mr. Chairman and ranking member -- suggest that a jurisdiction not within this committee get a substantial portion of this bill, because I believe that that is as appropriate as it is for the federal courts to consider domestic entities who are violating it.</p><p>And so with that, Ms. Oyama, if I'm pronouncing it right --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  -- has -- in your experience, has Google worked with the ITC or any other administrative law judges in executing on other people's judgments?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I would imagine in the patent context yes.  It's not my field, so I can't speak to it -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. ISSA:  OK.  But do you agree that having a court of continued jurisdiction -- that, in fact, can work for injunctive relief as technology is available is generally something that Google and the other search engines would see as reasonable once there is a judgment entered against an offender somewhere?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah, I think we'd be happy to work on that type of solution.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  And I'm going to get to the others, but Mr. Clark, if you had that and you had a judgment against party A who had an Internet site and then 25 other similar parties show up from the same country and have all the identities that tell you it's basically the same group you already have a judgment against, wouldn't you benefit from having a court that we specifically gave jurisdiction to to determine quickly that those are alter egos and execute upon them so that you wouldn't go through this whack-a-(mole ?) again and again trying to prove to somebody that it's basically the same people doing it again?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  My working relationship with the ITC has been very, very limited.  I'm not quite certain what their capabilities are.  If you're saying you're going to empower them to do certain work like that, it would make some sense.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Currently, they are the -- and the others would probably know this -- this -- that's a place that plaintiffs go to if there's any importation and they have a patent, because they can administer a decision faster than the fastest rocket docket, and unlike the eBay decision, they have injunctive relief not only as a tool, but as their one and only tool, and they use it without discretion because, in fact, that is the mandate of Congress.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  But you were still talking of a referral process.  I think the DOJ, then, for a criminal follow-up and for asset recovery --</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Right, and I recognize at some point the administrative law judges look and say we have a domestic entity that is not complying with our injunctions or a site that is just as rogue in the U.S.  So I'm very aware that there are elements here -- that if you are cooperating or facilitating with a foreign entity that there would have to be a referral.  That's not going to be Yahoo or Google or eBay.  It's going to be, as you know, the rogue sites you fight every day.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Right, and I would just be worried about the bifurcation of activity in the referral process and the elongation of the end result if something like that were arranged.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  So I look forward to showing both our witnesses and the committee that, in fact, the ITC's time to judgment and their execution is actually much shorter than our federal courts and less discretionary than the Justice Department generally.  And I thank the gentleman, the chairman, for his indulgence and yield back.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Issa.  The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX):  Let me thank the gentleman, chairman, very much and the ranking member, and let me call the roll and -- for the record and say that I want the U.S. Library of Congress, I want Pfizer, the Motion Picture Association of America, MasterCard, Google and our good friends in the technical aspect of our movie-making business and all supporters to be made whole.  I think we have a consensus that online piracy is a both devastating and destructive element of the nation's economy.  In fact, I have said, I think, I believe often that it steals the genius of this country.  We are very proud of the motion picture industry, and I am, if you will -- cup runneth over.  I may be your physical armor when I see the massive thievery that goes on and certainly in some of our international friends.</p><p>So I start off with that, and I want to find a common ground. And as I have looked at the legislation, I hope the chairman and ranking member will give us the time to really study the legislation. Several things come to mind.  One, this legislation has no referral. I'm a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and our committee spent years helping to build the switch to the DNS-SEC, and if this bill would pass we would have a challenge with that format.  And the question is would everyone who needs to make the changes to the DNS-EC would instead be on the phone to their lawyers asking whether they would be sued for adopting security technologies that will make the mandated block and redirect system even more difficult.</p><p>We have to look at all of these issues.  So I want to ask the Library of Congress first if she has any comments regarding that conflict.  We are supposed to be collaborative.  You're the only government witness.  I'm not sure if you've thought of that, but let me give you a second question quickly since our time is going quickly. I am concerned about how this bill will -- what effect it will have on small businesses, particularly those that couldn't afford to go to court should a rights holder come forward and demand that their access to revenue be shut off.  If a rights holder accuses a small business website of being -- facilitating -- of -- excuse me -- of facilitating infringement and a payment processor shuts off payments to that business, is the payment processor immune from suit under Section 104, and what rights do they have?</p><p>So first, is there any collaboration or recognition about the system that the DHS has formulated?</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't know the --</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Don't have that question?  Mr. Chairman, I think we have to have that answer from whatever resources we can get. Next, if you can have any insight on how it impacts small businesses --</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Yes.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  -- this particular legislation.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  So, that section of the bill I believe was actually invented to make it easier and quicker to avoid the court process and the cost.  That's the goal.  There is no liability for the intermediaries under that section.  There's an obligation if it goes to the next stage and there's a court order.  There's an obligation -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Right, so there's still a process that a small business might have to be engaged in.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  But --</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  There's still a process.  It makes it easier.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  There is, and they are good faith intermediaries and they have not themselves broken the law, and the bill tries to take that into account.  If we can refine that, we should.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Yes, because they still have an obstacle to climb, if you might.</p><p>Let me go to Ms. Oyamo (ph).  Excuse me.  Forgive us for all not reading the name correctly.  I don't have it in front of me.  But let me quickly give you a series of questions.  Ms. Oyama?  Is that correct?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  All right, thank you.  One of the -- one of the kind of groups that I've been engaged in over the last couple of months is the generation of youth that are excited about start-ups. They're everywhere.  They are job creators.  And I see them as the next nucleus of job creation in America.  They are -- they are obviously functioning now.  They're all trying to emulate all of the stars of Social Network.  We know that won't be the case, but they are trying to create jobs.</p><p>So let me raise these concerns with you.  I think immediately what comes to mind is that this legislation may be overly broad, that it too easily circumvents Internet users, and it is inherently incompatible with the way Internet actually works.  Would you comment on the overbroad -- the circumventing Internet users and incompatible with the way the Internet works?  Can you do that quickly for me?  And then I'd like to go back to Ms. -- if you can be listening to this question about the -- Ms. Pallante, if you have any idea about the problematic aspect of this for small -- again, small and minority businesses.</p><p>But Ms. Oyama --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure.  On the over breadth concern --</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Over broad.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- over broad -- a huge concern is the scope of the definition of what's a site dedicated to theft.  So that's a concern that's been raised among small businesses, larger tech companies.  If we're going to go after rogue sites, we have to make sure that they're rogue sites and they're breaking the law.  There's a lot of concern that right now the definition would cover new ground.  It would cover sites that today are complying with the DMCA, so they're taking down infringement when they're notified by rights holders.  It would be sites that today under existing law -- if they were hauled into court, they would be found not guilty under existing copyright law.  So I think there's scope concerns there.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Circumvented by Internet users, can be too easily circumvented by Internet users?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah.  So one of the concerns is that on the notice and terminate provision that piece does not go through a court, and so somebody could just notify a service provider.  You could go away for Thanksgiving if you're a website owner.  Your ads and payment providing services under the bill could be shut off in five days.  So there's a lot of concern that, you know, that doesn't really provide adequate due process in terms of the way current businesses work.</p><p>I would say in terms of the incompatibility with the Internet, in the Internet sphere Internet traffic is going to route around blockages, and so kind of working with the grain of the Internet we think is really smart, is really effective.  It's why we support the legislation we discussed before about cutting off the funding sources. It's worse in going after sites like WikiLeaks, which is incredibly sophisticated site.  Much of international law enforcement was going after WikiLeaks, and if you go to WikiLeaks' homepage, it says that they are going down because payment providers shut them off.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  (Inaudible.)</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentlewoman's time has expired.</p><p>The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS ROSS (R-FL):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman</p><p>Ms. Oyama, do you feel that this bill is an infringement of the First Amendment right of free speech?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  You know, I think short of the constitutionality, it certainly raises free speech concerns.</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Is it -- is it censorship that you're concerned about?  Is that --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah, so the U.S. has had a good platform globally to speak out for free expression, and I think a law like this which would for the first time empower the government --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  And now, it would empower the government to require you to do something that you don't want to do, which would be to shut down a site.  Is that correct?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We're happy to disable links when we're notified by rights holders.  We think that going --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  And as long as you do without a third party, such as the government, it's not an infringement of First Amendment rights, of free speech, nor is it censorship, is it?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  We don't do full site blockages.  We do page-by-page for copyright --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Would you do take-downs?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Under DMCA, yes.</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Yes, which is the same thing.  I mean, I'm just having a hard time distinguishing -- when you do it, it's OK, but when you have a third party, such as the federal government requiring you to do it, then it becomes censorship and an infringement of First Amendment rights.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  (I see ? 5:17).  I know the government --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  But let me go further.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- approach is much broader in this bill than -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Let me go a little bit further here because I want to go to your example of Dave's Emporium, which I think is a great example for people such as me to think simply -- to understand a small business.  But I want to look at it from a consumer rights perspective.  Let's say that Dave's Emporium, because of that 1 percent vendor that he uses on the Internet that's found through your Google search, results in the purchase of a product that causes death or personal injury.  Now, in that chain of commerce Google would be brought into action, especially where there's joint -- (inaudible) -- liability as a deep pocket, to defend that suit and probably pay damages.  All of that could have been prevented had there been an investigation, had there been the appropriate execution under this act.  In fact, not only would it have been prevented, but also under this bill is there not an affirmative defense that Dave's Emporium could've asserted in the sense that I don't have the resources to hire a lawyer that would mitigate my responsibility to now have to defend the order to take down.</p><p>So what I'm getting at is that even further you have immunities under this act that would prevent a third-party suit against you if you shut it down, but you don't have immunities if, in fact, you allow for the sale and purchase of products that are not only counterfeit but they also result in death or personal injury.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So on counterfeit, it's definitely something that we agree with you.  Counterfeit is a big problem.  It's something that we invest tons of engineering hours, millions of dollars into going after.  For example, for AdWords, we ejected 95 percent --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  But it would seem to me that you would -- you would want to have the immunities, you would want to have some protections, some safe harbors to prevent lawsuits against you in the execution of your -- of your -- of your business.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think if a court is instructing intermediaries to take action, there's probably some place for immunities, but the concern here is that Dave could be shut off for five days, not pursuant to his terms of service.</p><p>Certainly, no one -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  But he could be put out of business being sued because of a harmful product.  It could've been prevented had Google investigated the site.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So certainly, no one has an absolute right to ads or payment services.  We think that there -- (inaudible) --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Well, Dave's in a bad situation either way, and I think that he needs to have some protections, and I think that this bill offers him that.  But let me -- let me shift to another thing, and let me tell you, I appreciate what Google's done with regard to child pornography.  I mean, you guys have stepped up to the plate tremendously, and I think that's a wonderful example.  You need to be congratulated for that.  You do it because it's the right thing to do. And it would seem to me that following the letter of the law you could do the same thing in this regard in an effort to hold down or at least eliminate the use of pirated sites by way of the search engine in Google.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So child pornography's certainly a huge, you know, problem.  It's something we take very seriously.  Technically, going after child pornography on a search engine is completely different from copyright because a machine can detect child pornography.  A machine can look for flesh tones.  A human, if you look at it, would know what it is and could eject it, and with copyright --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  But it's still the right thing to do.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- you can't just look at a video and know whether it's infringing or licensed, right?  It needs to be a collaboration with the rights owner.</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Real quickly, Mr. Kirkpatrick, not a question, just a thank you on behalf of MasterCard for what you're doing because you're cutting off the source of the problem, and that's very important.</p><p>Mr. Almeida, I had a chance to meet a couple of days ago with one of your members.  A gentleman who -- a lifelong songwriter.  He's in this room.  And he met with me and he said you know, the problem ISA that it's a fight over -- between the movie houses and the producers. It's the small people, the people who have followed their passion, the people who have the artistic ability to do something they've always wanted to do that now after 30 years of being a songwriter has to look at whether he can keep his house, what his future's going to hold. And I wish you would do for me and explain to the members up here -- is how this adversely impacts not the giants in Hollywood and not the giants in Nashville, but those that participate, those whose creativity and innovation will be stifled unless there's some protections.</p><p>MR. ALMEIDA:  Well, I think there does need to be protections, and I think that's what this bill hopes to do.  And this isn't to protect the big dogs in Hollywood.</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Right.</p><p>MR. ALMEIDA:  Our members who are behind the scenes, who are stagehands --</p><p>REP. ROSS:  The foundation.</p><p>MR. ALMEIDA:  -- who -- the people who build the sets -- the backend payments for those workers support their health and pension fund.  And that's being cut up.  They're adversely being impacted by these rogue sites and by the piracy of their videos.  A video being released today will be available by the weekend on the web.  And so we -- we're hoping that this legislation will help to take a step forward in that area.</p><p>REP. ROSS:  Thank you, and I see my time's expired.  I yield back.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. Ross.</p><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MAXINE WATERS (D-CA):  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just say that I find the discussion on H.R. 3261 extremely interesting and engaging, and I think Mr. Watt framed this issue somewhat in his opening statement when he talked about the giants in competition and the profits and the money that's involved being at the basis of all of it.  And let me just say that I view any proposed changes in IP and copyright law as an opportunity to examine whether changes will expand opportunities for women and minority entrepreneurs, both in Hollywood and Silicon Valley.  And I come to this discussion just having witnessed a CNN presentation called Black in America by Soledan (sic) O'Brien this past weekend, which I found very, very interesting.</p><p>Having said that, I'd like to direct my first question to Maria Pallante, U.S. Copyright Registrar.  User-generated content, websites like Facebook and YouTube, are enormously popular.  Individuals and groups use these platforms to share videos that range from fraternity and sorority step shows and high school talent shows to videos of kids performing a new dance or imitating a new music video.  Many up-and- coming artists who don't have record deals also use UGC sites to showcase their talents covering popular songs.</p><p>Now, to the extent many uploaded video clips feature the use of copyrighted music and other types of content that is not for profit or commercial gain, do you think that this bill would include a safe harbor fair use exception or other explicit provision that would ensure we aren't trying to subject parity and leisurely activities to felony penalties?  Are you at all concerned that some of this section's broader language could have unintended consequences that may chill the use of UGC sites and digital platforms that has served an important social utility?</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Thank you for the question.  I'm not concerned as it's written.  We're talking about two different levels of activity. This bill would go after sites dedicated to infringement.  I think what is on the table in this room is a position that one can be compliant with the DMCA through notice and take-down of very specific sites when notified, and therefore, not have an obligation to participate in a solution that is about broad, willful, criminal, egregious, dedicated activity, two different -- they -- these two things will operate at the same time, and the notice and take-down system will remain intact.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Also, I would like to ask about another issue that I'm very concerned with, and I would like to direct this to Ms. Katherine Oyama, to Google.  I'm very concerned about the voluntary authority and legal immunity the bill gives Internet service providers to block access to sites they reasonably believe are infringing sites. This provision would seem to run counter to the FCC's recently issued open Internet net neutrality rules.  I can foresee cases in which an Internet service provider that owns online content may use the section as pretext to unfairly block access to a competing website that is not really dedicated to infringement.  This section does not require credible claims, merely a reasonable belief that doesn't exclude commercial disputes or anti-competitive conduct.  It is my understanding that the Senate doesn't have ISPs volunteering blocking authority in its bill.</p><p>Can you foresee any unintended consequences with the voluntary blocking provisions?  Is there a way that this bill could be refined to ensure that voluntary actions are based on credible evidence and certain thresholds?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure, thank you.  So we do see today the Internet use by countless small businesses to facilitate communication to facilitate e-commerce.  It is truly people's daily livelihood.  And so we do think that there should be due process built in.  It's something essential to your site, like your service is going to be taken away. I think the provision you were mentioning is Section 104 in the bill. I think the broader technology community shares those concerns.  You know, one, if you look at the scope of sites that could be captured by a service provider's reasonable belief that they were dedicated to theft within the bill, that's a very broad group, and then two, the number of service providers that receive complete immunity for terminating service without going through a court, without going through due process.  It's not just the providers that are required to take action under this bill.  It's much broader.  So it would include -- it would include advertisers, search engines, payment providers, but also domain name registers, ISPs, much broader -- you know, a much broader group of folks.</p><p>If you were to lose your domain name and you are a small and independent business, that is everything.  And so making sure that you are at least protected by the terms of service when you sign up for a contract would, you know, probably make sense (to us ? 16:02).</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back the balance of my --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Ms. Waters.</p><p>The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. King, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE STEVE KING (R-IA):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate being recognized, and I appreciate the testimony of the witnesses.  I want to just take a bit of a different tack here if I could, and looking at the fraudulent Internet sites and the piece of this that's a direct focus of this hearing.  And I'm just looking through some of the -- some of the background material, the problem of illegal pirating of copyrighted intellectual property.  And I would think that it is all trademarks and copyrights and patents all together that I think about, not just websites and things that we can look at.</p><p>And so the -- there's a pattern across this country or across the world of certain countries that are pretty effective with this.  And I just ask if there's anybody on the panel -- just raise your hand or answer.  Do you have a list of countries that are the most egregious violators of intellectual property rights from an American perspective?  Yes, sir.  I can't read your names.  I'm sorry.  So --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Thank you, Congressman.  It's Michael O'Leary. Sorry, the content industries contribute each year to something -- with -- through the State Department.  There's a number of different ways -- there's the notorious markets filing, which chronicles the areas of the world where this is the most problematic, and then there's the special 301 process whereby the United States puts forward a list and kind of categorizes where countries fall in terms of their protection and intellectual property.  And the reason for that, frankly, very simply, is that intellectual property is not just an American problem.  It's a global problem.</p><p>And what you're seeing around the world is that other countries are starting to recognize the benefit of not just protecting American intellectual property but protecting their own.  I would note, for example, that there are at least 16 countries in the world that engage in site blocking now, which has been the focus of some of the debate here.  The Internet seems to be working fine in those countries.  It seems to be having an impact in terms of taking sites like the Pirate Bay, which is blocked in many other countries but not in the United States, offline.  So in many ways the United States has historically been a world leader, but the truth of the matter, Congressman, from our perspective is if we don't step up and deal with the problems we have today, we're going to seed that ground, and we're not going to be the world leader.  And that's unfortunate or our country because we do lead the world in the production of intellectual property, and we ought to be leading the world in protecting it.</p><p>REP. KING:  Mr. O'Leary, do you have an opinion then?  You've given me a couple of sources I might look at.  Do you have -- can -- do you have a recollection on - from which countries originate the greatest theft of intellectual property?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Off the top of my head I would hesitate to list them in any type of specific order.  I mean, they're different problems in different parts of the world.  There are hard goods problems, which is kind of the more traditional disk type piracy that occurs in places like Russia.  There are problems with online -- a country like Spain has a significant online piracy problem.  There are other places in Europe.  We would be happy to provide you and the committee with a complete list.  I'm hesitant to speculate because I don't trust my memory well enough to get them in the right order.</p><p>REP. KING:  Is China on your list?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  China's on the list, yes.</p><p>REP. KING:  And --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  There's definitely a piracy problems in China, yes.</p><p>REP. KING:  And do you have any recollection of what the loss might be to American property rights holders to China?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  I don't off the top of my head.  It would be -- I'm not sure, frankly, that there's a way to measure it given the realities of China.</p><p>REP. KING:  Would anyone on the panel be aware of any studies that have U.S. trade representative -- it seems to me that three or four years ago at least the U.S. trade representative has a -- has a study done that calculates that loss of U.N. (sic) -- loss to U.S. intellectual property rights holders to different nations.  China, Russia comes to mind.  Anyone care to answer that?  I saw a nod on the end of the line to --</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Well -- Maria Pallante from the Copyright Office. I don't -- I don't have the dollar amount for you, but I would just echo what Michael said, which is that special 301 process in a -- identifies problematic standards in our trading partners when it comes to IP, as well as notorious markets and websites.</p><p>REP. KING:  Does anyone have a -- more of a comprehensive solution?  And we're talking about shutting down some websites.  But it's billions in theft of intellectual property rights globally.  And here we are, the United States of America, with the strongest -- some of the strongest laws and the strongest traditions of respect for intellectual property, and I don't see a broader comprehensive solution to this.  It seems to me that they can move faster than we can -- we can adjust to them and that we're dealing with a component rather than the big picture.  Yes, sir, Mr. O'Leary, and then --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Congressman, I would argue that you're correct in the sense that this is a global problem.  It's multifaceted.  There is not a single approach that fits.  But it's critical important that the United States maintain the high ground and the leadership in this, because if we do not do it, other countries will not.  I would also note that the problem you're highlighting about the criminals moving faster -- that's true regardless of what the crime is.  You ask anyone in law enforcement -- that they'll tell you you catch the ones who keep doing the same thing, and the people who would adapt and a change -- you have to keep changing them.</p><p>REP. KING:  Are you aware of any state-sponsored intellectual property right theft?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Are we worried about it?</p><p>REP. KING:  Are you aware of state-sponsored intellectual --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  We believe that that occurs, yes.</p><p>REP. KING:  And I want to say I believe that happens from China as probably the lead globally to do that.  Does anyone disagree with that in the panel?  I didn't hear any disagreement.  I think I've gone far enough with this since my red light came on, but I do appreciate your -- all your testimony and I hope we can bring some piece of solution to this, and I hope at some point we can bring a whole solution to it.  Thank you very much, and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Thank you, Mr. King.</p><p>The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE STEVE COHEN (D-TN):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is indeed an important issue for us to work out, and the theft of intellectual property is of great concern, but it -- nevertheless, First Amendment issues are important too.  And my first thought is that it doesn't seem like you need -- that there should be that much difference from what the Google folks and the techy folks are wanting and what the MPAA and the RIA and the other AAs want.  Let me ask maybe the gentleman from Motion Pictures, who's apparently got a Rick Perry problem with not being able to count to something, Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>Have you all not gotten together and tried to work this out in some way and fine tune this to where there aren't these issues of people being penalized that are not guilty and sites being, you know, shut down where there's just a small infringement but not a total infringement?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, we don't believe that this legislation would result in either of those things happening, but we work with -- our studios work with Google on a regular basis in terms of trying to get stuff taken down off the Internet.  There are ongoing relationships on this piece of legislation.  There have not, to my knowledge, been specific discussions about this.  But I want to be very clear.  We have said from the beginning that if people are willing to come forward with constructive suggestions on how to do things that are not a pretext for maintaining the status quo that we would listen to those things.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Wonderful.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, do you have some positive, you know, not under a pretense type -- pretext type of discussions that you'd like to come forth with?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.  So I think just in the broader context of figuring out how to go after piracy, it's really important to keep in mind the number one most effective tool for going after piracy would be to increase the amount of legitimate lawful services that are available on the Internet, right?  So if we can cut off the funding, we would decrease the supply of these pirate sites.  If we could have more legitimate services for music and movies and everything else, which I know the studios are working very hard to do, that would also decrease the consumer demand for this type of -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Without necessarily itemizing each of them now --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  -- have you had the opportunity to pose these --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  -- to the other team?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah, so although we're here in D.C. today, I would assure you that all of our business partners, you know, on the West Coast are working very collaboratively, very, you know, much together to get to those solutions.  And we're always more than happy to continue to work with Mr. O'Leary and others -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. COHEN:  So -- (inaudible) -- are you all working now trying to come up with some language that would maybe -- that the chairman might put in the manager's amendment that would make all people happy?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  You know, there's been some conversations that I think there would be a lot more.  (Inaudible) --</p><p>REP. COHEN:  I would hope there would be a lot more, and I think that's something that should take place.  Let me ask you a question, since I've got -- since you're at the microphone.  There are a couple of search engines in China and Russia, and Yandex I think is one of them and Baidu.  And some consider these rogue sites, and that -- whether they are or not, I don't know.  They could be.  If they were considered such and they were blocked because they had some pirate type folks among their constituency, how do you think the Chinese and Russians would respond toward your company and toward the United States companies?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  That's an excellent question.  So I think we should realize that even though we would do something for a really good reason here, it could potentially have international ramifications. If the U.S. government is ordering U.S. companies to disappear foreign search engines from our results, it's -- it should be expected that there's going to be some form of retaliation internationally.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  And those sites are the leading Chinese and Russian search engines.  Is that correct?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  The sites that you mentioned are, yes.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Yeah.  So if they -- if we -- is it possible under this legislation they'd be totally cut off entirely, they'd be --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  If they were deemed rogue sites --</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Right.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  -- under Section 102, they could -- search engines could receive an order to disappear the whole site.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Right.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  It's really tough in a search engine because although you can remove the direct link from a search, you know, as long as a rogue site exists, people are still going to talk about it.  They're still going to blog about it.  They're still going to post about it. And so it's really not possible to remove all worldwide discussion of a link.  And that's why we support the follow-the-money type legislation because that's really going after the source of the problem by choking off their financial reason to -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. COHEN:  Let me ask you another question, or maybe to the panel.  I have a -- (inaudible) -- by constituent services.  We do great constituent services in Tennessee 9.  And this week on 11-14 Ryan Turner wrote me an email, and he says I'm writing as your constituent.  As a constituent, I oppose this Stop Online Piracy.  I'm a student studying management of information systems.  Should this pass, I believe my future IT would be crippled. Having a government- handed DNS server scares me, especially with the government suing website owners with one -- (inaudible) -- with -- I think this is a misprint, but links -- as a content -- as a college student who owns over 30 domain names, most of these places for third parties to post text responses.  Should one of those include a link to material that infringe copyrights, now I would be held responsible.  I have no funding available to handle these claims, and I'm lucky enough to be trained on how to handle lawsuits, but many -- I -- many other entrepreneurs without formal training have no idea how to handle it.</p><p>If he had this and there was one text that came back that was maybe the link to an illegal site, would he be cut off and would he have to then go to -- higher a lawyer and possibly go to court?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think so.  I think there's two ways that could happen.  So one of the concerns, you know, that -- not just Google, but the other technology companies who endorse the testimony, the other trade associations, are concerned about is that the definition in 103 of what is a site dedicated to theft is very broad.  There's some language in there that also refers to a site or a portion of a site.  So people have a lot of serious questions about what does that mean?  Are we looking at a full site, or are we looking at -- you know, in today's Internet the way most websites work -- there's real- time communication, and so you have lots of real-time comments.  You have lots of real-time posts.  If one comment or post is infringing, does that, you know, impugn the entire site, or are we looking at it holistically?</p><p>There are some other words in the definition that give people concern that it's over broad.  So either being swept in in that way or under the very broad immunities that are being given to service providers.  Pretty much anyone who qualifies under the definition of a qualifying plaintiff, which is very broad -- they could go to a payment or advertising service provider.  They could allege that the person that you mentioned is dedicated to theft, and then those providers have complete immunity to shut him off.  So there's kind of -- there's a concern that there's a strong incentive in the bill that if you wanted to immunize yourself the easy thing to do would be to comply with that notice and shut them off, and then --</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman's time has expired.  And I don't mean to cut you off, but you could bring your answer to a quick conclusion.</p><p>Have you finished?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think that's good.  (Thank you ?)</p><p>REP. SMITH:  OK.</p><p>REP. COHEN:  I think you could go longer.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Quayle, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BEN QUAYLE (R-AZ):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank all the witnesses for being here.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, I want to go back to what you were just talking about earlier about how long term we can address the pirate -- piracy issues via more legitimate websites that provide legitimate content on the Internet.  And I want to go to your testimony -- that you indicated that the only long-term way to beat piracy online is to offer consumers more compelling, legitimate alternatives, and you sited YouTube's free ad-based model for monetizing content.  I mean, there could be some disagreement.  I don't know what's the best way to monetize content, whether it's fee-based or free ad-based.  And if you look over the course of history, except for broadcast, it seems like most quality content has not been given away for free.</p><p>So one thing that I want to ask you is would you agree that the piracy issues that we're dealing with and the pirate websites that we're dealing with actually makes it more difficult for a company to start a fee-based site that offers legitimate content, and thus, it forces content providers to look for ways that are going towards web and ad-based -- I mean, ad-based content to give it away for free?</p><p>KATHERINE OYAMA:  I think there are so many different models in the ecosystem right now.  Certainly the problem of piracy is of tremendous importance and great concern to any content provider, right?  You want to have control over the distribution of your content.  Some people chose to release it for free because they want to participate with their fans in that way.  Others want to license it and others want to have an advertising model.</p><p>I think the, kind of, beauty of all the new services that we're seeing is that there's no one size fits all.  I do think we would approach YouTube as a really great example of how, kind of, technology and copyright can work together.  There's a tool on YouTube called content ID.  Because YouTube is the hosted platform we host all the content, so it's on our servers.</p><p>So, through content ID we are able, immediately, a rights holder would give us their file.  If a user uploads a piece of content we would immediately scan 6 million reference files.  And we could capture, if their song or their movies are being uploaded and then the rights holder would have control what it can monetize with.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  I think my more direct question is that if we don't, aren't able to crack down and have the tools and ability to crack down on the pirate websites then you are actually forcing content providers into a narrow avenue of ad-based, providing only content via ad based in free markets, and that's not, not free markets, free content.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  For both, both would be tremendously important, right?  Increasing --</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Exactly, but I mean it kind of goes, when you're looking at that and how we need to crack down on the piracy, ad based, which is the model that Google uses, and that seems to be why, one of the reasons you would be pushing for that because that is the way that Google makes their money, right?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  There's different ways, but that's the primary way, for sure, yeah.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  And I then I think the, that that's just, my biggest concern is that if you're looking at just ad based you're cutting down one significant avenue for people to provide content. And if we don't shut down these pirate websites then we're going to actually lose out on different types of business models, different types of content providing, that was the point I wanted to make.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Right.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Ms. Pallante, I want to go to you.</p><p>Earlier you stated in your opening testimony that you do not believe that the safe harbors under the DMCA are actually weakened by SOPA.  Could you expand on that a little bit?</p><p>MARIA PALLANTE:  Yes.</p><p>First of all, the bill says that.  And secondly, as a savings clause, and secondly there's not monetary relief.  The injunctions that are allowed are already permitted under the DMCA.  There are, contrary to popular belief, ways to to get an, enjoin certain actions for search engines and ISPs.</p><p>And there really, this bill is really designed to sit next to the DMCA.  The DMCA is related to particular files on a website and does not require the participation of those who are really in a good position to help stem the tide of piracy.</p><p>So, I would object to, I mean I object to a couple of things I just heard from my witness, my fellow witness.  One is that, I'm pretty sure, that Google just said that it's the fault of content owners that we have rogue websites; that just can't be the truth.</p><p>Secondly, although follow the money could be effective it does not bring in everybody in the ecosystem; it doesn't bring in ISPs, it doesn't bring in search engines, it doesn't account for the vast number of website that offer content purposely for free, and it doesn't really address the broader rule-of-law issue that we have on the Internet right now.</p><p>REP.     :  And in the DMCA there are actually instances where a service provider can take down all content on the webpage or a website if there is infringing content on that website.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  The only way I see that happening is if every single rights holder comes together at the same time and approaches the website and every file is actually infringing.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  So it could be possible under the DMCA?</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Highly unlikely.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Ok.</p><p>But one thing I wanted to just get your final thoughts on because opponents of the bill actually say that it's going to endanger the security and the integrity of the Internet.  One of the things that the Internet has been very good at is in commerce.  And wouldn't it also be fair to say that without shutting down these pirate websites then we are also endangering the security and the integrity of the Internet because they are putting out, often, counterfeit goods and also infringed copyright material.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Right.</p><p>So, there are three underlying purposes.  One is to protect the content owners about their own property.  The second is to allow those who want to invest a place where there's sunshine and Oxygen and a good environment for that.  And the third is to protect consumers, absolutely.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Thank you.</p><p>I yield back.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Can I just clarify one point?  I just wanted to make sure that nothing was mischaracterized because I do not think that it's the fault of the rights holders.  Certainly rights holders have the right to protect their content however they want and we are completely committed to going after piracy.</p><p>My only point was that the success and the consumer appetites for services like Netflix and iTunes shows that there's a lot of different licensing models out there.</p><p>MR.     :  Can I follow up on that?  On one point, which I think is a practical point, which is being missed to Mr. Quayle's question?</p><p>There are legitimate services out there now.  There are more of them then there have been before, there will be more of them tomorrow. The problem is is that when you go to Google and you punch in the name of the movie, those legitimate sites are buried on page eight of the search results.  There is a better than average chance that Pirate Bay is going to end up ahead of Netflix.</p><p>That's a fundamental problem, no matter how many legitimate sites are out there, that we can't overcome and we can't do anything about. If we could get Google to reindex those sites in a way that favored legitimacy, to answer your question, Congressman Quayle, the consumers would be getting to those first.  But when Netflix is buried way down in the search results it doesn't matter how good Netflix is, is going to be.  And that's just a practical problem that could be addressed today.</p><p>REPRESENTATIE LAMAR SMITH (R-TX):  Ok.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Quayle.</p><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-CA):  Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p><p>I would like to ask about the savings clause and I'd like to ask both Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary about your opinion on this.</p><p>I'm aware that concerns have been raised by Internet companies and many others said language of the bill may have unintended consequences.  And even though everybody agrees that the problem with foreign rogue sites is critical and that we need to cut revenue to these sites, there may be disagreement on the language as drafted. And I think it's really important that we try to reach some common ground, that we work through language that is balanced and effective and make sure that we don't have unintended consequences.</p><p>One of the areas of disagreement on the Stop Online Piracy Act is on this question of the savings clause and whether there is the immunity that is provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for search engines and Internet service providers.  And so, I would like to have your different opinions because there, some have represented to me that the Senate bill has a savings clause that seems to address this but SOPA does not.  And is that true?  I'd like to have your different opinions on this, Ms. Oyama and Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure.</p><p>So, this is actually, it sounds technical, the savings clause, but it is of critical importance to the technology industry. Businesses today really build their business models under the safe harbors that they know they have under the DMCA.  So, if a technology company receives notice of infringement they are required to expeditiously remove that infringement.  But they don't have, kind of, a general monitoring obligations.</p><p>So, the balance that we're trying to strike in any legislation would be, if there are intermediaries who are required to do new things under this bill, that the bill would be really clear, advertisers, shut off your services, payments, shut off your services, and that would be clear and we would take those obligations.</p><p>We want to make sure that this bill that's going after rogue sites doesn't strip us of those important safe harbors in, kind of, unrelated litigation or, you know, open the possibility that those types of orders could be used to establish red-flag knowledge.</p><p>And so there's some language that we proposed that would, kind of, alleviate that concern.  And keep this bill as effective as it needs to be to go after rogue sites.  But a savings clause to make sure that we're not opening ourselves up to liability in a way that we would somehow need to proactively monitor all user-generated content in real time is really important to us.</p><p>REP. CHU:  Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>MICHAEL O'LEARY:  Congresswoman I would just associate myself with the comments and the testimony provided by the register of copyrights.</p><p>This legislation is a compliment to the DMCA, it doesn't impugn those rights or the safe harbor in any way shape of form.  The DMCA deals with good actors, legitimate services that are trying to take steps to get infringing stuff off of their sites.  Rogue sites deal with a group of people that under no definition would fit underneath the DMCA; they are bad actors, they are dedicated to infringement. These actually fit together, they compliment each other.  In no sense does this undermine the DMCA.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think if that's the case a one sentence clause line in any legislation would be tremendously helpful.</p><p>REP. CHU:  Ms. Pallante, what is your opinion on this?</p><p>On the savings clause and whether there are enough protections and the DMCA is not --</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  So, again, thank you for the question.  The question, again, is just, the problem is just because somebody made the complaint under the DMCA does not mean that they shouldn't take action if the attorney general finds that there's a foreign infringing site, one by criminals who are engaged in piracy.  That is a, just an unfair comparison and this bill, if that is the argument this bill does allow for that that it's my view that it should.</p><p>REP. CHU:  Well, I'd like to ask a different question, and that is about job creation.  There are some that are saying that SOPA would stifle innovation and job growth and that was a roaster (ph. 10.47.23) opinion that, which was a finding by the U.S. Supreme Court that it contributed to infringement, that venture capital would dry up.</p><p>But, Mr. Almeida, in your testimony you noted that you represent over 4 million U.S. workers and on their behalf support, that you actually support the Stop Online Piracy Act as an important jobs bill.</p><p>How do you respond to these claims that this legislation would stifle innovation and job growth?</p><p>PAUL ALMEIDA:  I think innovation is alive and well in the U.S. and I don't see this as stifling it in the least.</p><p>Our members work in the United States, they're taxpayers.  They go to work.  They make products that we view as entertainment.  That is what we see this online piracy infringing on.  And you can't hit a price point when someone's giving it away for free, to make a business model to compete with free.</p><p>It also has to do with constructive innovation, and we believe in constructive innovation, like Netflix, as opposed to tvshack.bz, which is an infringing site that should be taken down.</p><p>REP. CHU:  Thank you.</p><p>I yield back.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  Did she yield back?</p><p>Did you yield back?</p><p>Thank you, Ms. Chu.</p><p>The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Poe, is recognized.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TED POE (R-TX):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Thank all ya'll for being here.  This panel, or this committee is made up of former prosecutors, defense lawyers, and there are even to former judges here.  And back in my experience on the bench down at the courthouse or the palace of perjury, as I referred to it in those days, I saw a lot of thieves.  And it's, you know, stealing is stealing, and thieves are people we ought to deal with.  I disagree with you, Mr. O'Leary, they're not bad actors, they're thieves.</p><p>And this legislation is trying to get a grip on this.</p><p>We've got three groups that are here.  We have the credit card companies, we have the search engine folks, and we have the content providers.  If I had it my way I would lock all three of you in a room and say, don't come out until you all agree, and then we could solve it; I would think.</p><p>If you pull up, as I did, if you pull up on Google search engine, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or Harry Potter, Free Harry Potter movies or free The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, you get a lot of free sites on there.  And as a consumer, I can't tell who's a thief and who's not a thief.  And I know Google is doing a lot, millions of sites and all that, I've heard the testimony, but at the point we are now, what can Google offer to this bill that Google would sign on to the bill?  Specifically.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure.</p><p>So, to your point about the search results, one of our major commitments we made this year was to improve the tools to make sure that when rights holder notify us their search with us will be disabled in the search.  And so the commitment that we had made at the beginning of the year was to reduce turnaround times to under 24 hours.  And so we're happy to say, right now it's six hours or less is the average turnaround.</p><p>In terms of what we could do affirmatively</p><p>REP. POE:  Yes.  But this day forward, you pull up \"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas\" and you keep going page after page for free grinches.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So long as those sites are there, they are going to show up on the Internet.  And so we think that legislation that would target the source of those sites is necessary.</p><p>What we would do is we would support legislation that would go through the Department of Justice.  So you would have a law enforcement aspect, you would have a court determine that a site is dedicated to infringement.  You could serve those orders on U.S.-based payment providers and advertising.  We have Google check-out for payment.  We have AdSense adware, a lot of advertising products that would directly regulate and impact our business, but we think that if we can break the financial ties for those sites then that is really smart, targeted and effective and would avoid some of the collateral damage that we have discussed earlier this morning.</p><p>REP. POE:  So your answer is, just go after the finances.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Cut off the money.</p><p>REP. POE:  Yes, cut off the money.  So if that were something that we added to the bill that cut off the money then Google may support it.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes, so there's certainly concepts in the bill that reflect that.  We think if you look at WikiLeaks, that is how they've been taken out, is by cutting off the money.  It's an approach that U.S. law enforcement uses for many different international problems, you know, narcotics, terrorism.  I mean, it's been a proven way.  If you cut off someone's financial incentive, they're not going to want to pay for the servers and the bandwidth and the infrastructure to run these Web sites.</p><p>REP. POE:  Let me be a little more specific.  What can Google do? Not what the financial providers can do.  What can Google do to move this legislation forward?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sir, there's a lot we're doing in the private sector but in terms of the legislation we would publicly support legislation like what I described, follow the money approach.  We would be happy to do that.  We'd be happy to work with your staff on legislation in that way.  If it can avoid the collateral damage that we've discussed and if we got a good definition of what's a rogue site that didn't limit legitimate U.S. businesses.</p><p>REP. POE:  But you can't tell when you pull it up, the \"Grinch Who Stole Christmas,\" who's the real Grinch and who's not.  You get all these -- page after page of free Grinches.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  That's why court adjudication or cooperation with rights holders is really important.  There's lots of legitimate free movies.  There's lots of, you know, content that just the middleman wouldn't really know if that was licensed or infringing.</p><p>REP. POE:  You want to weigh in on that, Mr. O'Leary?  And then Ms. Pallante.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  You know, I think to use the example of the Grinch, there's a movie right now, as I mentioned earlier, called \"J. Edgar.\" The only lawful place you can see that movie is in a theater.  If you go back to your office and put J. Edgar into Google you're going to get the same list of eight pages of sites where it's free.  That movie is not available for free anywhere.  If you want to see it, you have to go to a theater right now.</p><p>So I understand the complexity when you're talking about something that is perhaps not in the theater, but this is actually in the theater right now and there's no reason for it to be online in any fashion, frankly.  I also think that what is being proposed, what was being suggested is, as I said earlier, we should follow everybody's money, and isolating one or two things, that doesn't solve the search engine problem that we've been talking about, and we think that should be a part of the discussion too.</p><p>We think it requires all of the people that are involved in this to work together to get it done.  Kind of to your theory of throw everybody in a room and sort it out.  If everybody doesn't go in the room at the beginning, you're not going to sort it out.</p><p>REP. POE:  Maybe we need a court order to get you all three in a room.  (Laughter.)</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll yield back.</p><p>REP. SMITH (?):  Thank you.  Maybe get the FBI to help you on that J. Edgar Hoover stuff.  Mr. Deutch, you're recognized for the next five minutes.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, it's not just \"J. Edgar.\"  I have teenage daughters who are awfully excited about the new \"Breaking Dawn\" movie which is coming out.  You can watch that right now online for free.  What troubles me about this whole exchange, quite frankly, is on the one hand there's this great technology, Ms. Oyama, that you're so proud to trumpet, understandably, from YouTube, and what YouTube does in order to prevent illegal content from being posted.</p><p>Yet when you enter -- watch \"Breaking Dawn\" for free and you can do it online now, there you throw your arms up in the air -- well, there's nothing we can do.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I can understand how that would feel frustrating. Technologically there's a distinction, so on YouTube, the content that's posted on YouTube is hosted on our servers so we're able to match files.  If someone tries to upload something on YouTube we have a reference file we can match against.  We don't control the worldwide web.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  I understand that's a technology issue.  We could talk more about that.  I have another question for you.  There is -- this has been a fruitful exchange, different than I might have expected from the way, as a number of us have referenced already, the way this debate is played out in the local press in particular.  I don't know whether Google shares the position publicly that this bill will kill the Internet and all the advertisements that have resulted in all the phone calls that we received in our office.  But I do wonder whether there is any base level here that you would agree needs to be tackled.</p><p>And so if the issue is the language that says \"a portion thereof.\"  Let's assume that the bill didn't have that language in there.</p><p>So you can't argue that Twitter would have to be taken down.  Which, by the way, is an argument that is -- there's no basis for that argument under this bill.  You can't argue under this bill that Facebook would have to be taken down.  There's no basis for that under this proposed bill, and I think that you understand that, notwithstanding the reference to individual tweets that might lead a whole site to be taken down.</p><p>My question is, if that language weren't in there, are there any of these Web sites that you believe should be taken down, and that Google ought to play a role in helping us accomplish that?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yes.  We would be happy to work with the chairman, with your office on a follow-the-money legislation.</p><p>MR. DEUTCH:  OK.  Well, let me -- I understand if you don't like the way that the bill is written.  Let me ask you about that because you've referred, you made many references today to following the money.  Yesterday your chairman recommended regulations based on tracing payments -- (inaudible) -- Web sites offering illegal materials as a replacement for this bill, consistent with what you've said today.</p><p>Many of the offshore sites clearly engaging in theft are driven by, as you point out, are driven by ad revenue, not just credit card transactions.  And if we want to follow the money, we can't just focus on the credit cards obviously.  We have to focus on the ads.  Google, at least from the statistics I've been told, retains over 75 percent of all search advertising revenue in the U.S.  Therefore, following the money leads us to you.</p><p>So tell me what \u2013 tell me the steps that Google has taken already, understanding that you're concerned about this intellectual property theft, understanding the impact that it's going to have, that it has every day on our economy.  Tell me the steps that Google has taken to combat it, using the follow-the-money approach that you favor.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  OK.    So just to confirm, and legislation that would go after ads is a big part of our business \u2013</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  I understand.  I understand, but given --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  And we're happy to support that.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  I understand that, but tell me what you've done now in the absence  -- because we all acknowledge this is an important issue.  And if it's 75 percent of the --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  And one shouldn't prevent the other, right.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  Right.  You can play a significant role today.  So if you could just speak to what you've done.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  OK.  So there were some major commitments that our general counsel, Kent Walker, made at the beginning of the year.  I'll just try to tick off the major ones, but we should probably follow up with your office on more specifics.  For the MCA we've removed more than 5 million infringing files this year, as one rights holder has notified us.  One of the concerns we had heard is that there was some grit in the system and that there was frustration that it was taking too long.</p><p>So we invested significant engineering hours and money to improve this tool \u2013</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  Ms. Oyama, I hate to tell you but I don't have a lot of time here.  But I would \u2013 I'd ask that you'd follow up.  I remember Mr. Walker's testimony.  I followed up with a letter after that hearing requesting all sorts of information that that letter is still not \u2013 I've not received a response.  So I hope that -- I hope that a response will be forthcoming to that letter and to the requests that I've made here today.</p><p>I just -- I'd like to finish with this.  This notion that we're going to break the Internet, that somehow we're going to stifle innovation, the fact that the kid serving me coffee at Starbucks told me, hey, I hear you're taking up legislation that's going to make it impossible for me to download music -- the fact is what we're worried about, and the reason this legislation, the reason we're having this discussion, what we're worried about is not stifling that innovation in the future.  That's a concern that we all have.  I don't believe that the legislation does that.</p><p>But we know right now if we do nothing that the film industry and those young directors who are starting out aren't going to be able to do their craft and we're not going to have the next Adele or we're not going to have the next Drake because they're not going to be compensated for their work.  And I hope that as we go forward and as you provide those answers that we can have an honest discussion about what's really at stake here and let's move past these attacks on those of us who believe this and suggest that somehow we're going to mean an end to the Internet.  It's not accurate.</p><p>I think you understand that it's not accurate, and it doesn't do the American economy any great service at all.  And with that I yield back.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman yields back, and the gentleman from Texas \u2013 the other gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Mr. Chairman.  Again I also appreciate your being here.  It is a tough subject.  And we're dealing with intellectual property here and I, like my friend Judge Poe, was a district judge and also a chief justice and we dealt with -- it wasn't called bad actors.  You know, you dealt with theft, and that's really what we're talking about here.  It's a crime, it's a theft.</p><p>We don't want thieves working their way through an honest, legitimate, wonderful means of, in this case the Internet.  In the past some have used the analogy of the pawn shop, that, you know, the pawn shop can't intentionally and knowingly assist in theft, and so there were laws made.  Most states have them where law enforcement can go in and get information.</p><p>Now I know, and I've been resistant to some of the pushes to force Internet providers, search engines into doing things that we don't even require pawn shops to, and I thought some were going overboard in trying to make demands on search engines that we don't even demand of pawn shops.  But on the other hand there is this aspect of our criminal law, and every state has it, the federal government has it.  Anyone who aids, abets, encourages, in any way assists someone in committing a crime, the law is very clear in every state, in the federal code, you're just as guilty as if you committed the crime yourself.</p><p>The question is, do you intentionally or knowingly aid.  Well, it's been brought up often enough, there are thieves using the Internet and I keep hearing from people who say, look, if it were illegal for me to use that free Web site, then how come I get access so easily?  They're expecting us to do something.</p><p>And I think most of us were hoping that there would be something worked out between the interests here, but I can give you an example. I know what the law is, and I was -- I had an eight-track, \"Warm Shade of Ivory,\" Henry Mancini, back in college, and it got me through some all-nighters, that and Jonathan Livingston Seagull soundtrack.  So anyway, \"Sleepless in Seattle\" has the song, \"In the Wee, Small Hours of the Morning,\" and I wanted to get that.  I wanted to download it. I paid two bucks for it, not just 99 cents.  Nobody has it except some free Web sites.  I knew not to go use those and download it free because it's illegal.  Most people don't.</p><p>So when we talk about follow the money, we're talking about something terribly difficult in going to China, going to Russia and trying to follow the money over there.  We're not getting help from those folks.  Marsha Blackburn and I met with their folks in China that handle this stuff and it seemed pretty clear to me we weren't going to get a whole lot of help out of them.</p><p>So what should we do to keep from hurting the innovation of the Internet and Google and Bing and these folks that come up with great ideas, but at the same time balance the interests in this being a law- abiding society?  And I'm gratified to hear people on both sides of the aisle have similar concerns.</p><p>So it just doesn't seem to me to be that onerous to say if someone goes to court, for heaven's sakes, and proves with probable cause standard that somebody's committing a crime of theft, and then that is presented to an Internet provider, a search engine, these people are committing a crime, there's probable cause to believe that's justification for a warrant, why that's too onerous to say, don't make them accessible?</p><p>And I'm still having trouble understanding that and I would welcome comments in that regard from whoever wishes to.  Thank you.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Thanks.  I think we completely agree about the importance of having a federal judge play the role of an arbiter so that focuses -- services aren't being terminated just by a five-day notice to their provider without the ability to appear to defend themselves.</p><p>I think to your point about what we can do, it's probably three things.  So one would be building on the DMCA.  Under the DMCA today search results can be line edited out.  If a rights holder tells a search engine to remove a piece of content, we have worked incredibly hard over the last year to improve our tools.  The average turn-around time today is six hours if we receive notice.  So we're working really hard on improving that.  It's not perfect.  It's not done.  It's something we'll continue to work on.</p><p>The second piece, though, would be to build on that and to come together and support legislation that would impose new obligations on other providers.  So we are also an advertising provider, largely an advertising provider, a payment provider.   A judicial process where a court determined that a site was dedicated to infringement and then instructed U.S.-based intermediaries to shut off financial ties to that Web site, that's the most important and effective thing we could do.</p><p>If we can knock them off at their knees and we can cut off their financial ties, they won't have a reason to be in business any more. They won't be making money.  That's the effective way to go.</p><p>And then the third piece would be to get rid of the ineffective and harmful pieces.  So I realize reasonable people can disagree about this, but there is a tremendous concern in the technology industry about some of the remedies that are being proposed and some of the unintended consequences that would have, you know, potentially very severe repercussions for the Internet network, for people's security and for free speech concerns.  So getting the balance right is something we think is important.  We certainly think that there is a way forward and a way that we could all agree on going after these sites.</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Can --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Would the gentleman yield?</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Well, I'd ask unanimous consent to allow others to finish answering, because there's a couple of hands.  And I certainly --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Gentleman is extended another minute.</p><p>REP.     :  (Inaudible.)</p><p>MR. CLARK:  I'd just add that in regard to your comments about thievery and Congressman Poe's, from our industry's perspective, it's more than thievery:  It's murder.  We do feel -- I particularly feel -- and I have 28 years of federal law enforcement; I know crime when I see it.  And I see counterfeit medicines as actually attempted murder. I mean, it's not quick, it's not immediate, but when you're only giving a patient 20 percent of the medicine they need to cure their cancer or their heart problems or their high blood pressure, you're in fact killing them slowly.  But that's the issue here and --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  But as a prosecutor, you know that may not be murder.  It may be negligent homicide or other -- some other type of homicide.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  Along those lines.  And it's frustrating if we are not immediately making progress in cutting that down.  I've worked with CVPs (ph) in pilot programs, and I'm seeing those counterfeits flooding in because of the purchases over the Internet from the rogue websites that are selling counterfeit medicines.  And it's incredulous to me how much is coming into the United States.  So I would say, you know, this bill is -- going forward was demonstrating that we need to change the status quo.  We can't accept what's, you know, existing right now.</p><p>And I agree very much that we have to demonstrate to people that there are consequences.  And this is a serious crime.  When you look at six months, four months, three years (as ?) your cost of doing business, it can't be that bad if that's all they're going to give. So I also see the Title II in this as very, very significant as well.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Was there anybody else that wanted to comment? Thank --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Would the gentleman yield?</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Yeah, sure.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  I just wanted to briefly -- one of the -- I think it was Mr. O'Leary suggested that if you type in J. Edgar -- \"J. Edgar movie,\" you get all these infringing sites, and I just did that.  And what you get is the showtimes in Washington, a review, the Wikipedia article, the trailer from Warner Bros., several reviews of the movie, the iTunes trailer.  There's not a single infringing site that comes up.  So I just --</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  (Inaudible) -- reclaim my time -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP.     :  (Will the gentleman yield ?)?</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  If you used the word \"free\" in there, that's where those things come -- yes, I'll yield.</p><p>REP.     :  Would you yield?  Well, I just did the same thing. And on --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Did you use yougle (ph) -- Google or Bing?</p><p>REP.     :  I just used -- Googled it, \"watch J. Edgar free online\" on YouTube, full version; shows you how to download it, no cost, right here.  Three's a link --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, I did a different search engine.  But the point I'm trying to make --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Will the gentleman -- the gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Reclaiming my time -- OK.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  I would ask that the gentleman be granted 15 seconds and -- so I might say just in answer to --</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Thank you.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  The point is, the search engines are not capable of actually censoring the entire world wide web.  That's the problem. You can't do that.  And so we need to go after the people are committing crimes in a way that's going to work.  I think that we can do that, but this still is not it.  And I thank the gentleman.</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  Well, with respect --</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  The gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>REP. GOHMERT:  I agree, but we also need to cut off the get-away car.  And with that -- and I'm not sure what the gentlelady has against Google, but I respect her using Bing and yield back my time.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  The gentleman yields back time he does not have. (Laughter.)  I'm going to accuse you of being a liberal here in a minute.  (Laughter.)</p><p>Mr. Johnson is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HANK JOHNSON (D-GA):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. O'Leary, SOPA requires payment networks like MasterCard to suspend payment transactions between a U.S. customer and an online merchant within five days.  According to Ms. Kirkpatrick's testimony, there are very legitimate challenges that payment networks have in meeting such a short deadline, especially considering the multiple players involved in an online transaction.  The Senate version requires payment networks to take action as expeditiously as reasonable.  Earlier this year, the White House negotiated a best practices document with the payment industry that has a reasonable period of time standard.  Which of these standards is acceptable to you:  the within fives days under SOPA; the expeditiously as reasonable under the Senate version; and a reasonable period of time as negotiated between the White House and the payment industry?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Yes, sir, I think it's a legitimate question and one that we believe can be resolved favorably to everyone.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  Which one do you think is most acceptable to --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  As I sit here right now, I'm not prepared to pick between the three, quite honestly.  I certainly understand the point that was made by our colleagues at MasterCard.  If it's not possible -- (inaudible) -- in five days.  We certainly don't want to create a time limit which forces them into an impossible situation.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  All right.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  At the same time, we would like the legislation to recognize that if someone's trying to run the clock out, they don't -- they don't -- they don't do that.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  If I give you -- if I open up the tent for you to stick your nose in, boy, you're going to get all the way up in there. I'm just appreciating your gift of gab.</p><p>If I might ask Mr. Clark the same question.</p><p>MR. CLARK:  I feel the same way.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  OK, all right.</p><p>MR.     :  Sorry, I feel the same way.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  All right.</p><p>Ms. Pallante, Section 506 of the Copyright Act establishes criminal liability for the willful infringement of a copyright. Recently there has been confusion as to the definition of that term \"willful.\"  Do you think that willfulness is the same as intentional, or does the act -- tell me about the difference between those two standards.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Right, so that's a great question.  And the point of SOFA is to capture those that knowingly engage in a -- in a known legal duty, and that is the standard that most courts have accepted. There are some exceptions to that.  I think that's something that could be clarified in the bill, in legislative history perhaps.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  All right.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, the DMCA in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act represents the legal underpinnings of the view that intermediaries need not monitor or supervise the communications of users.  It is a view that we have long touted and pushed across the world through various diplomatic channels.  We have harshly criticized governments who use such virtual walls to prevent citizen access to the Internet -- China is a great example.</p><p>With that in mind, would this legislation allow companies to demand that search engines located inside the U.S. censor where American consumers are able to go on the Internet?  And how would this legislation likely be viewed by China and other -- and Iran and other countries that put these roadblocks up in terms of content to their citizens on the Internet?  And how would that affect our diplomacy?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Thanks.  So, for the DMCA piece that you mentioned, I think we would certainly agree the DMCA has proved to be a foundation for American innovation and has struck a balance.  So if you're a new company or starting up, you know what the laws are, you have certainty, and it also helps rights holders.  If a right holder is aware that there's infringing content on the service provider, they just need to let us know -- web posting companies, search engines -- we will remove access to that content.  It strikes the right balance. It does -- it takes care of infringing speech.  It leaves up legitimate speech.  And it reflects a careful balance.</p><p>It also -- because of the way web services are used today, we see all over the place -- when there's real-time events, it's important that a web platform enables that type of real-time communication or real-time e-commerce.  If you didn't have the DMCA and an intermediary platform was required or potentially liable for what its users were posting in real time, you would have to implement some type of proactive monitoring system.  It could really change the dynamics of the web today.  I think the second --</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  That would stifle the small entrepreneur that's just getting started more than it would hamper the larger providers of content --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think it's both.  But certainly --</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  It would be a burden on both.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah.  If you're a new company, starting off, you'll have less money to invest in that type of monitoring.  So it -- certainly it would have an impact on small businesses.</p><p>To your question about, you know, kind of the speech aspect, you know, if we impose a law here which would have court orders requiring of domestic search engines to make entire full websites disappear -- and especially if there's some type of overbroad definition which would, you know -- (inaudible) -- (illegitimate/legitimate ?) speech -- you know, unfortunately what we do here would have other ramifications.</p><p>And we may think that this is a good reason -- we do think it's a good reason here.  But we feel the time for Google of DMCA requests, competitors try to take each other down, pro-democracy speech tries to be quelled.  We've seen in Libya, in the recent activities there, different politicians trying to take each other's YouTube channels out because they disagree with their views.  We see copyright use all the time as an excuse to quell speech.  If we mandate this type of approach here, we really need to think carefully about what types of international ramifications that will have on free expression globally.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  The gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  If I might get just one more question.</p><p>REP. SMITH:  All right, the gentleman's already had extra time, but so has everybody else, so go ahead.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>The Justice Department has responsibilities under the -- under the SOPA Act, while at the same time we've been talking about downsizing government.  And in fact, the Justice Department has lost about 30 percent of their attorneys.  How does this affect the effort to criminally go after these pirates, and also from a civil standpoint?</p><p>I'll ask that to Mr. O'Leary.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, I think that, you know, this bill actually speaks directly to that point.  That's part of the reason there's the ability for individual plaintives to move so that the burden does not fall solely on the Justice Department.</p><p>The content industry, Pfizer --</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  What about the criminal part, though?  Because we get people getting prosecuted for shoplifting and stealing little small, petty items.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, these are -- sure.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  But this is multi-billion dollar white-collar fraud, which only the Justice Department has or should have the -- really has the resources and the breadth of law enforcement ability to address how does the downsizing of the Justice Department impact criminal prosecution.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, I think as a general premise, when you downsize the Justice Department, obviously it has an impact.  But let's be very clear.  The Justice Department does pursue criminal cases internationally.</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p>REP.     :  The gentleman's time has expired --</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  Thank you, Mr. --</p><p>REP.     :  -- sometime ago.</p><p>Recognize myself for five minutes.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  Well, I am a liberal.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Oh, I would not accuse you of being anything else -- (laughter) -- my friend, my friend.</p><p>REP. JOHNSON:  Well, I -- (inaudible) -- with great honor.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  (Laughs.)</p><p>This is sort of reverse of the old story that I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.  (Laughter.)  I came here and -- as one who has not made up his mind on this bill hoping to receive information on this.  And I think everybody on this panel is committed to fighting piracy.  I mean, maybe I'm the only member of this committee who's got a gold record.  I got it from the recording industry for my work on anti-counterfeiting when I was attorney general of California.  So I very much believe there's an important role for us to play, law enforcement and civil law, in this regard.</p><p>But my concern is something that was brought to my attention as the chairman of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and that is the existence of a system that has been ongoing for some years called DNS security, or DNSSEC.  And I have heard from those -- some of the engineers that have been working on this in the Internet area -- that if we applied this law in this way, it would undo what we've been doing to try and secure the Internet by way of DNSSEC or DNS security.</p><p>So I'd like to ask the panelists if any of you feel you can speak to this point, because it's one that was raised with me.  I'm not a technical expert on this -- but with some real alarm by Internet engineers, I would call them -- who really don't have a dog in this fight, but are concerned -- in terms of the disputes between the various special interests here -- and I mean that in a proper way, special interests -- and so what I ask Mr. Clark, for instance, are you aware of this criticism, and does this legislation -- would it disincentize Internet service providers from using the DNS security extensions because it mandates the redirection of customers to another website?</p><p>MR. CLARK:  No, I'm afraid I don't -- I'm not familiar with that and not --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  OK.</p><p>Mr. O'Leary?</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Well, I'm certainly aware of the argument.  And the people that we've talked to, it's a concern which is frankly overstated.  As I mentioned earlier in response to another question, there are numerous countries around the world that engage in this type of activity.  The Internet has worked without a problem in regard to that.</p><p>And I think also, you know, they're overlooking and looking at this debate, there is an existing security problem with the current state of play, and that is these rogue sites taking private information from consumers and spreading malware and spyware and things like that.</p><p>The final thing I would say is that, in regard to other things, like dealing with malware, dealing with spyware, dealing with child pornography, this type of activity occurs all the time, and the Internet seems to function just fine.  I tend to agree with the comments of Mr. Deutch, that is the Internet is going to be all things to all people, it should also be in terms of trying to help us stop people from stealing our stuff.  The problem frankly is, is that the Internet seems to portray it as --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Well, that's not my point.  My point is whether or not you can respond to the specific question raised by Stewart Baker, former DHS assistant secretary of policy and former NSA general counsel, to the effect that if this approach to respond to a legitimate problem were put into effect, it would undercut an effort that's been going on for nearly a decade to secure the Internet by way of this program that I referred to.</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  We disagree with that position.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  OK.  Can you submit in writing for us specifically how you disagree with that --</p><p>MR. O'LEARY:  Certainly, happy to.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Ms. Kirkpatrick?</p><p>MS. KIRKPATRICK:  I'm unfamiliar with that element.  I'm unaware of it.  I don't have the technical expertise to comment on it.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Does anybody with your organization has the expertise to comment on it?</p><p>MS. KIRKPATRICK:  I certainly can follow up and get back to you .</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Would you please respond to that specific question?  Because to me, it's an underlying question that's extremely important.  Having worked on the problem of cybersecurity, if what we're doing here has the unintended consequence of upsetting what is, at least in the opinion of a number of experts -- and they may be wrong -- I'm trying to figure this out -- undercut a real effort that would practically help us secure the Internet, that is bothersome to me.</p><p>Ms. Oyama.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure.  So I think the concerns that you mentioned are the ones that we've heard from as well from many cybersecurity experts.  I know Stewart Baker has written about this.  The designers of DNSSEC themselves have published a white paper.  I have not -- I have not --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Have your -- have your people --</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Yeah --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Do you have anybody that has expertise with your association that could respond to that specifically?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  I think there's --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Because this is -- this is not part of this hearing, and I'm very concerned that evidently this bill is not being referred to my subcommittee.  And we have -- and I'm not parochial about this, but if we're going to do it, we ought to at least talk about it and have people come here and say, well, our organization, either we don't take a position or we're not experts on this, is upsetting.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So I think that there is great concern within our company --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Well, could you please respond in writing on that?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Sure, happy to.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Could you please?</p><p>And Mr. Almeida?</p><p>MR. ALMEIDA:  No, no expertise.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  OK.</p><p>Ms. Pallante, you have any?</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  I think that Congress should absolutely consult objective technical experts.  But what I'll add is that ICE, through operation in our site, has been using the existing seizure and civil forfeiture laws to essentially disappear websites in the United States.  So this bill would take that criminal standard and apply it to foreign sites.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  OK.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Let's see, who's next?</p><p>Mr. Marino is next.  (Inaudible.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TOM MARINO (R-PA):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.  And I want to -- I think my colleague and friend, Ms. Lofgren, and I pointed out a very good example of how easy this is on some sites and not others.  I think -- I think Zoe went to Bing and got the trailers, and I went to Google, typing in free, who sent me to YouTube for the free movie. So, you know, it's -- there's a lot of work to be done here.</p><p>Ms. Oyama, I want to compliment you on your decorum and your professionalism and your loyalty to your company for being here and answering the tough questions that you have been answered -- you have been answering.  You're certainly an asset to your corporation.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Thank you.</p><p>REP. MARINO:  Nevertheless, I think it's reprehensible that the chairman, that the CEO, that the president, that the council, none of them thought it was responsible enough for them to be here, and they sent you into the lion's den.  And you certainly deserve a large portion of their bonus at the end of the year.  (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  Can I just add one thing?  Our general counsel, he was here in the spring.  He cares very much about this problem and doing it the right way.</p><p>REP. MARINO:  Good.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  He I think sent a letter saying any other day -- he had a longstanding personal commitment for today, any other day he would be here, and he looks forward to -- (inaudible).</p><p>REP. MARINO:  All right.  I give that to him, and I remove him name from that list and he can keep his bonus.</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  (Laughs.)</p><p>REP. MARINO:  All right?</p><p>Let me ask you a question here.  I want to thank Google for what it did for child pornography, getting it off the website.  I was a prosecutor for 18 years and I find it commendable, and I put those people away.  So if you can do that with child pornography, why can you not do it on those rogue websites?</p><p>And let me follow that up with why not hire some whiz kids out of college to come in and monitor this and get -- you know, and work for the companies to take these off?  My daughter who is 16 and my son is 12, we love to get on the Internet and we download music and we pay for it.  And I get to a site and I say this is a new one, this is good, we can get some music here.  And my daughter says, Dad, don't go near that one.  That's illegal; it's free.  And given the fact that you're on Judiciary, I don't think you should be doing that. (Laughter.)  So it's pretty -- maybe we need to hire her.  But why not?</p><p>MS. OYAMA:  So the two problems are similar in that they're both very serious problems.  They're both things that we all should be working to fight against.</p><p>But they're very different in how you go about combating it.  So for child porn, we are able to design a machine that can detect child porn.  You can detect certain colors that would show up in pornography; you can detect flesh tones.  You can have a manual reviewer where someone would look at the content and they would say, this is child porn and it shouldn't appear.</p><p>We can't do that for copyright just on our own, because any video, any clip of content, it's going to appear to the user to be the same thing.  And so you need to know from the rights holder, the owner of the rights, have you licensed it, have you authorized it, or is this infringement?</p><p>REP. MARINO:  I only have a limited amount of time and I appreciate your answer, but we have the technology; Google has the technology.  We have the brainpower in this country.  We certainly can figure it out.</p><p>Let me move on here.  First of all, Mr. Clark and Mr. O'Leary, I want to thank you for your dedication to law enforcement.  I've been down there for 18 years and thank you so much.</p><p>And Mr. Almeida, my father was a fireman for 30 years, so I know exactly what you're talking about.</p><p>So I want to pose this question to anyone.  It's my understanding that taking down a portion of a site is much more difficult than taking down the entire site.  That's what I'm hearing from the testimony here.  So is there a more balanced approach that we can assist you in taking, let you take the lead on it in diffusing this problem, and stopping this infringing on this material, this illegal stealing of our materials that is costing us jobs and costing this country a lot of money?  You understand my question?  Please jump in, anyone.  (No response.)  I don't think anyone understands my question. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ms. Pallante.</p><p>MS. PALLANTE:  Well, I -- no, I appreciate the question.  I don't know the answer.  It certainly is -- when law enforcement goes before a judge and tries to get a court order that would allow it to seek relief from the website and then engage the search engine, the ISPs, the payment processors, et cetera to help, they would like to stop the infringing material and not the noninfringing material.  I don't know if it's a technical solution or if it's just a question of each website having different pages where they can easily find the infringing content.</p><p>REP. MARINO:  Do any of you agree with me that we do have the brainpower and the technology available to figure this out, if we want to spend the money?  (No audible response.)</p><p>All right.  Thank you, and I yield back my time.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Great, gentleman's time's up.</p><p>Mr. Amodei, you're recognized for the last five minutes of this hearing.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MARK AMODEI (R-NV):  Thank you for that strategic timing of my recognition, Mr. Chairman; I appreciate that.  And so in honor of your discretion, I will not use the whole time.</p><p>I would like to first of all associate myself with the comments of my colleague from California at the end of the dais, Mr. Deutch.  I think he's hit the nail on the head.  When you're the last guy, you don't want to try to see if you can prolong things anymore than usual.</p><p>I would like to ask the chair, however, if since there's written responses to this security thing -- and I tried to write the guy's name down; I'm new -- I don't know, maybe it was Stewart Baker -- maybe we could have Stewart Baker's concerns (in written ?) so we could have something to compare those with.  And if that's out of order, then I'll shut up on that and move right along --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Mr. Baker's article was -- (inaudible) -- be part of the record.</p><p>And the gentlelady -- the gentlelady from California is giving it to you right now.</p><p>REP. AMODEI:  OK, thank you.  Thank you --</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  And if I were chair I would have him here, but I'm only temporary chair.</p><p>REP. AMODEI:  Thank you for your compassion for someone who's been here for 61 days.</p><p>Finally, so that I have something to yield back, I appreciate the concerns and all.  This strikes me as one of those deals where the pursuit of the perfect is going to get in the way of the good.  One thing -- and I apologize for missing the part that I missed, but there was an opportunity to talk with some folks in another committee that was kind of important -- but I didn't hear anything that said, no, this is not an issue; no, this is not taking place; no, those jobs of this gentleman on the end are not being threatened; no, it's not real- time impacts when Mr. Marino can dial it in and be watching it right now.</p><p>Quite frankly, I think there's an issue -- I don't know how you address it, because nobody should leave the room thinking I'm technically savvy -- but I don't have anything to type on, as a matter of fact.  They even took my iPhone away today, so -- but I'll tell you this.  The impacts are instantaneous  Once it's downloaded, it's gone; that horse is out of the barn and it's never coming back.  And when you have a broken leg, you need to go to the hospital.  And like it or not -- and I -- and I agree with Mr. Marino's comments:  Way to go. Whatever they're paying you, it's not enough.  And so if those pansies want to come by someday and say hi, tell them they're welcome. (Laughter.)</p><p>So anyhow, when your leg's broken, you've got to go the hospital. And unfortunately, you're in the medical business on this stuff.  And so I can just tell you that my concern is this.  You are a major operational piece of this.  The criminal activities are uncontroverted that are happening, and to do nothing is wrong.  Nothing happens quick in this -- in this process,  I believe, from my vast amount of experience, and so it's time to try something.  And so while I appreciate the concerns, when I hear a reoccurring thing of \"follow the money,\" there's plenty of money around to follow.  And that's a good thing.  I'm a Republican.  It's a good thing to make money.</p><p>So I will just tell you, from my perspective, it's time to move. And while there are other concerns -- and we want -- if there was a perfect bill that ever came out of here, it will sure be neat for me to be here while it happens.  But I'm guessing it's not going to happen when I do, so I would appreciate best recommendations so that we can get moving on in terms of stopping something that's taken several years just to get to this point.  I am not picking on you.</p><p>And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I see the light is where it is. I yield back the most time that anybody's yielded back today.</p><p>REP. LUNGREN:  Very good.  The gentleman will be commended.</p><p>I'd like to thank our witnesses for their testimonies today. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record.  We thank you all.  We appreciate your testimony on a very difficult subject.  This hearing is adjourned.

EDT DATE: WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 2011</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  (Sounds gavel.)  Good morning.  The Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet will come to order, and I'll recognize myself for an opening statement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today's hearing is the second of two oversight hearings the subcommittee will conduct to examine issues that surround digital theft and online counterfeiting.  At our first hearing on March 14th we received testimony from the acting register of copyrights, a representative from the Center for Democracy and Technology, a representative from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, and the chief operating officer of Paramount Pictures.</p><p>While there was disagreement as to solutions, each witness affirmed the importance of protecting intellectual property online. They also acknowledged the need to ensure that whatever legislation Congress considers is appropriately balanced and takes into account the views of a variety of stakeholders.</p><p>In discussing the first hearing, I want to take a moment to clarify a point that arose and that we may revisit today.  The seizure process for IP crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the United States is current law.  It was enacted as part of the Pro-IP Act that is -- was -- that this committee originated and passed on a bipartisan basis several years ago.  That process, utilized by the government, is the remedy for infringing sites over which the U.S. can bring a seizure action.  This includes, for instance, the domestic and foreign sites that are registered on the dot-com and dot-net top-level domains.</p><p>The purpose of these hearings is, in a broad sense, to examine current and anticipated threats to IP online.  As part of that inquiry, we are looking into the adequacy of existing laws that were enacted to protect investments and promote creativity online. Foreign-based and foreign-registered infringing sites are not reachable by U.S. authorities, yet the Internet enables criminals anywhere in the world to defraud and jeopardize U.S. consumers while generating revenue from U.S.-based businesses.</p><p>Any legislation that grants new authority to protect Americans and deny access to our markets to wholly foreign parasites will not be based on our seizure laws and process.  That's because there is no property, such as a server or a domain name, in the U.S. to be seized. However, it has become increasingly clear that new tools are indeed necessary to meet the growing levels of theft online.</p><p>Online theft significantly impacts the music, movies, software, digital book and other industries that are increasingly moving to digital delivery of goods and services.  However, it is not limited to these industries; indeed, it also impacts traditional manufacturers.</p><p>I hold in my hand a real and a knockoff Vibram shoe.  I challenge anyone to tell me which one is real.  They both have the toes that you all are familiar with.  And these fake goods, along with even more dangerous goods, like fake medicines, car parts and others, are being sold illegally online and shipped directly to consumers in the U.S.</p><p>These foreign sites go to great lengths to make their illegitimate goods appear legitimate, including promoting the logos of financial services companies, hosting advertising on their sites from legitimate companies, and even charging close to the same prices for fake goods that the lawful owner charges.  We must aggressively combat this theft.</p><p>Today we will receive testimony from an outstanding panel of witnesses.  First, ICE Director John Morton is here to describe the critical role his agency plays in combatting IP theft in the physical world and on the Internet.</p><p>Director Morton will discuss the important role of the IPR center, which brings together 17 key domestic and foreign investigative agencies to leverage resources, skills and authorities in order to provide a comprehensive response to IP theft.  He will also describe the Operation In Our Sites initiative, a law enforcement operation that fuses the authority contained in Pro-IP to target websites used to sell counterfeit goods or distributed -- distribute pirated merchandise and copyrighted digital materials.</p><p>Since June 2010 this high-visibility and labor-intensive operation has executed judicially authorized search warrants and resulted in the seizure of 119 domain names as part of ongoing criminal investigations.  According to the Motion Picture Association of America, the seizure of nine sites that traffic in infringing movies and TV programs in the first operation had a huge deterrent effect and resulted in the voluntary suspension of 81 of the 300 most active pirate websites.</p><p>Our second witness, Floyd Abrams, is one of our nation's leading authorities on the First Amendment.  Appearing on his behalf, Mr. Abrams refutes the suggestion that the Internet, while free, should also be lawless.</p><p>Our third witness is Kent Walker, the senior vice president and general counsel of Google.  Best known for its interactive search function, Google is the dominant player in web-based advertising and applications and is increasing its market share in Internet-enabled mobile devices.  Mr. Walker states, \"Google leads the industry in helping to combat copyright infringement and the sale of counterfeit goods online.\"  To their credit, Google has taken positive steps, such as developing the content ID technology it uses on its YouTube platform.</p><p>Google has also announced the intention of taking additional steps to improve copyright enforcement online.  That said, the question isn't so much what Google has done as much as it is what Google ought to do.  Many rights holders have serious questions about Google's willingness to cooperate in a meaningful way.</p><p>Among their concerns, they note the revenue that flows from Google's ad networks to unlicensed sites that are clearly infringing, the prominent posting of infringing files on Google's Blogspot, which is hosted on Google-owned servers, and the time it takes for Google to comply or even respond to DMCA notice and takedown requests.</p><p>Time will not permit a complete discussion of all of these concerns with Mr. Walker today, but I will appreciate his public and personal commitment to myself and the other members of this subcommittee to work closely with us to respond fully and promptly to any further questions we have that we might forward after today's hearing.</p><p>Our final witness is Christine Jones, who serves as the executive vice president and general counsel of the Go Daddy Group.  As the world's largest registrar of domain names and a hosting provider, Go Daddy maintains a large, 24/7 abuse department whose mission it is to preserve the integrity and safety of Go Daddy's network by investigating and shutting down websites and domain names engaged in illegal activities.</p><p>Go Daddy's policy is to immediately investigate complaints that a customer is engaged in unlawful online activity and to permanently suspend services to any domain name, website or registrant they conclude is engaged in illegal activity.  Go Daddy voluntarily and permanently suspends support of -- for all the parasites associated with such a customer's account.</p><p>Ms. Jones has several specific recommendations on steps we can take to make the Internet a safer and more trustworthy place for consumers and owners of valuable IP.</p><p>In my own estimation, the need to fashion new tools to more effectively and meaningfully combat digital theft and online counterfeiting is beyond reasoned discussion.  The most serious questions relate to the scope of appropriate relief and the balance of interests among stakeholders and the public.</p><p>In addition, I want to note that this is the furthest thing from censorship.  A civilized society respects property and promotes lawful individual expression, whether it occurs online or in the public square.  This hearing is another important step in advancing the public debate and enhancing the ability of our members to assess the true character and impact of criminal infringement on the Internet and to design new tools that will be adapted to current and emerging technologies.</p><p>I look forward to working with members on both sides of the aisle and with our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol as we advance this effort.</p><p>It's now my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MEL WATT (D-NC):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And let me thank Chairman Goodlatte for providing the subcommittee with two hearings on this important issue.  I think it is critical that we look more broadly at how we promote investment and protect legitimate commerce online.  And a primary means of doing that is deterring the electronic theft then of legitimate commerce and products just as aggressively as we try to deter theft of products on the ground.</p><p>These hearings are affording us the opportunity to do that and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, to fashion an appropriate remedy for what might romantically be called piracy, but what we still refer to in my neighborhood as theft, or simple stealing.</p><p>As I noted in my first hearing -- in our first hearing, online theft of intellectual property is increasing and negatively affecting both the rights holders and the nation's economy.  Theft of digital work such as music and movies carries with it substantial downstream damage, hitting the pockets and livelihoods of businesses large and small and their workers and artists.  Who wants to make something or use their intellectual innovation or creative talents if the fruit of their labor is just going to be stolen?</p><p>Businesses are hemorrhaging profits, shrinking staff and, in some instances, facing extinction.  Counterfeit products of all kinds sold online not only create a drain on the economy, but they can also pose serious health and safety risks for an unknowing public and jeopardize the financial security of individuals.</p><p>Luxury goods, automobile parts, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals have all been hijacked by criminals with the tacit assistance of credible payment processors and, yes, reputable players in the Internet ecosystem, and spurred by the demand of consumers.  The criminals would rather use their ingenuity to deceive and exploit than to conduct legitimate business.</p><p>The magnitude of digital theft and online counterfeiting together is simply staggering, and they have to be stopped.  While the anti- circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA, have provided rightsholders with some protections against theft, the scope of these protections is narrow and their reach provides no protection against threats from foreign websites.</p><p>Similarly, the notice and takedown provisions of the DMCA established an enforcement model that while engaging many actors in the Internet ecosystem relies in the final analysis upon ISPs and other online service providers to implement enforcement.  The gaps in the DMCA suggest that the time to supplement its provisions to address the broader range of theft is upon us.</p><p>The scope of the problem has become so immense that every participant within the Internet ecosystem must assume some responsibility for taking the profit out of piracy.  As a member also of the Financial Services Committee, I'm familiar with the laws and regulations imposing obligations on banks to curb the tide of money laundering.  While we require banks, not because they are bad actors, to report deposits in excess of $10,000, we do so because we want to deter criminals from using reputable financial institutions to further their criminal enterprises.</p><p>Similarly, I believe it is incumbent on us to ensure that legitimate Internet intermediaries are protected from criminal elements which the evidence overwhelmingly suggests are exploiting U.S.-based businesses to infiltrate the U.S. market, reaping profits while undermining our economy.</p><p>This applies also to criminals who operate beyond our borders and register domain names with foreign registrars.  Despite current efforts of IP rightsholders and law enforcement officials, it seems clear that new authorities and enforcement strategies and enhanced cooperative partnerships are critically needed to combat the use of foreign websites by criminals to reach American consumers.</p><p>Additionally, any law we craft must to the greatest extent possible account for new technologies and anticipate the creativity of criminals to circumvent the law.  This is even more important in a global economy.</p><p>I look forward to the recommendations of our witnesses and thank them for being here.  And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentleman for his very cogent remarks.  And I am now pleased to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a leading advocate for efforts in this area, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Smith.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LAMAR SMITH (R-TX):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>This important hearing is the second of two of the IP subcommittee devoted to the destructive effects of online parasites -- web-based entities that steal intellectual property.  Practically anything capable of being reproduced digitally or available for sale in stores is only a click or two away today.</p><p>That's a good thing when consumers purchase from legitimate businesses.  But increasingly, consumers are being steered to web stores that traffic in counterfeit products.  According to the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmaceuticals, 95 percent of online pharmacies are unlicensed or traffic in counterfeit drugs.  When patients go online and end up buying fake medicines, more than trademark is in jeopardy.  The lives of those or their loved ones are placed at risk.</p><p>So this is about both protecting lives and intellectual property. It is also about jobs -- jobs lost as a result of digital theft and online counterfeiting.  The jobs lost in legitimate industries tend to be high-paying jobs that provide income and security to tens of thousands of Americans.  For instance, jobs in the U.S. entertainment industry have an average salary of $76,000.  This is 72 percent higher than the national average.  When jobs like these are lost, entire families become victims.</p><p>With digital theft, what is distributed was created by those who've had their property stolen.  Perfect reproductions of movies, sound recordings, books, software, musical compositions, compete directly with licensed goods.</p><p>The Constitution provides for the progress of science and useful arts by giving Congress the specific responsibility and duty to spur creativity and innovation by securing those IP rights.  Our job on the House Judiciary Committee is to protect the right of free expression and to provide due process of law.</p><p>A recent study of online activity revealed that nearly one- quarter of global Internet traffic involves stolen IP.  This digital theft is now so pervasive, profitable and pernicious that it discourages creative companies from investing in the production of new licensed content.</p><p>IP theft not only adversely affects creators, but also undermines investments in new technology by innovative companies such as Netflix. Securing property rights and protecting IP is a matter that unites members on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Hill. While we'll never achieve unanimity, there is a great deal of consensus that new legislation is needed to deal with threats that have emerged as technology has progressed.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the chairman.  And it's now my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE JOHN CONYERS (D-MI):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>We were yesterday over on the other side meeting with the chairman of the Senate judiciary, the chairman of this committee, the subcommittee chairman of this committee, the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, and myself, pledging publicly to be as cooperatively as we can in the ongoing examination of how to get a bill out of here that will satisfy at least a few, maybe even most of you that are present in the room today.</p><p>Now, there are a number of companies -- and Google isn't the only one -- and other search engines that act as intermediaries that facilitate what all this lecturing is about of privacy and stealing and so forth, arguing that we should -- and there -- we're beginning to examine what responsibility do they have.</p><p>Are we all the innocents, and all the bad guys are overseas doing all this?  Or under Title -- Title XVII, in Sections 501 and 506, this government and copyright holders cannot adequately stop so far online infringement at the speed that's necessary to stop the crimes.</p><p>On the Internet, once a file of an illegal move has been uploaded, for example, days and even minutes can result in copies of the file traveling to every corner of the web.  The Department of Justice and our civil suit system move at a very slow pace.  The DMCA has been insufficient to stop what's going on, of the proliferating on sites -- operate off our shores.  As fast as we close a few down, others spring up.</p><p>And so I'm glad that Lloyd Abrams is here, the number-one man in First Amendment concerns, because we've got a big challenge in front of us.  Now, we're going to move toward closing down some of this international illegal activity.  And the challenge is how to do it without violating due process and First Amendment.  And so I join everybody here in all the rhetoric.</p><p>But why don't we just cut off some of the money?  These streams of pirate sites, instead of cutting off each one every time it pops up, to pop up somewhere else, why don't we eliminate some of the financial incentives by cutting off funding from the customer through the payment processing system, or cut off the funding from the advertising networks?</p><p>What about the Department of Justice, with the authority to go after the worst to permit them to order court-supervised takedowns and access blockage of rogue sites from within the United States?  And maybe that we need to talk to the attorney general again on this subject.</p><p>Finally, and this is almost unthinkable, we could -- we could begin to grant a right of private action to allow people to challenge some of these providers and engines and payment processors.  And I know -- and I will be the first to  be critical if we -- if we step over the line, but I think that there is more that can be done and I think that we -- we need to use this hearing  as another opportunity to come up with some legislation that we will all be proud of.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentleman.  And without objection, other members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.</p><p>We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses today.  Their written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety, and I ask the witnesses to summarize their testimony in five minutes or less.  To help you stay within that time, there's a timing light on your table.  When the light switches from green to yellow, you'll have one minute to conclude your testimony.  When the light turns to red, it signals your five minutes have expired.</p><p>Before I introduce our witnesses, I would ask them to stand and be sworn.  (Witnesses rise.)  Do you and each of you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?  (Responses not audible.)</p><p>Thank you, and please be seated.</p><p>Our first witness is John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  ICE is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the second-largest investigative agency in the federal government.</p><p>The primary mission of ICE is to promote homeland security and public safety through the criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws that govern border security, customs, trade and immigration.</p><p>Before his confirmation in 2009, Mr. Morton spent 15 years at the Department of Justice.  While there, he served as an assistant United States attorney, counsel to the deputy attorney general, and acting deputy assistant attorney general of the Criminal Division.</p><p>During his tenure, Mr. Morton has sought to strengthen ICE's investigative and enforcement efforts, with a particular emphasis on border crimes, export controls, intellectual property, and child protection.</p><p>Our second witness is Floyd Abrams.  Mr. Abrams is a partner at the New Yorklaw firm of Cahill Gordon and Reindel.  He has -- his practice is diverse and includes intellectual property, media and communications law.  An internationally noted trial and appellate attorney, Mr. Abrams is best known for his experience and expertise in First Amendment issues.</p><p>He is the recipient of countless awards and honors which I will not attempt to enumerate, but perhaps none is more noteworthy than the description of Mr. Abrams by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan as, quote, \"the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age,\" end quote.  Mr. Abrams earned his bachelor's from Cornell University and his J.D. from Yale Law School.  I understand he is testifying in his personal capacity today.</p><p>Our third witness is Kent Walker.  Mr. Walker is a senior vice president and general counsel of Google.  In the latter role, he is responsible for managing Google's global legal team and advising the company's board and management on legal issues and corporate governance matters.</p><p>Before joining Google, Mr. Walker served in a variety of senior legal positions at other technology companies.  These include eBay, Liberate Technologies, Netscape, America Online and AirTouch Communications.  Prior to serving in these positions, he served as an assistant United States attorney, where he focused on the prosecution of technology crime.  Mr. Walker graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and earned his J.D. with distinction from Stanford Law School.</p><p>Our final witness is Christine Jones.  Ms. Jones is the executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary to the Go Daddy Group, Incorporated.  With more than 47 million domains under management, GoDaddy.com is the world's largest domain name registrar.</p><p>In addition to being responsible for all legal affairs, Ms. Jones oversees the domain services, network abuse, government relations, compliance and legal departments of the corporation.  She has been active in her support of Internet-related legislation to, among other things, protect children from predators, protect patients from counterfeit and unlicensed drugs and enhanced transparency and accountability among those who operate online.</p><p>Before affiliating with Go Daddy, Ms. Jones practiced privately and worked for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.  She earned her bachelor's from Auburn University and her J.D. from Whittier Law School.  In addition to being an attorney, she is also a certified public accountant.</p><p>We welcome all of our witnesses to the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet today, and we will begin with Mr. Morton's opening statement.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Watt, members of the subcommittee.  Good morning as well to Chairman Smith and to Ranking Member Conyers from the full committee.</p><p>As you know, ICE is an aggressive investigator of intellectual property offenses and we run the National Enforcement Center for IP Crime just across the river in Northern Virginia.</p><p>Now, why is ICE so heavily engaged in intellectual property enforcement?  The answer is simple:  American businesses and consumers are under assault from organized counterfeiters and copyright thieves. American jobs, American innovations, the safety of our people are all at risk -- not minor risk; serious risk, risk calculated in the billions, risk that threatens the foundation of certain U.S. industries, risks that put people in hospitals.</p><p>Remember, counterfeiters and copyright thieves aren't trying to make America great.  They don't pay taxes, they don't create jobs, they don't provide health care or pensions.  They don't invest in the next Oscar-winning movie, the next life-saving drug or the next technological advance.  They don't care about safety or health standards.  Instead, they wait for others to do the research, for others to work hard, for others to play by the rules, and then they take what they can't make on their own and profit at our country's expense.</p><p>In short, we have a significant problem on our hands and resolute action by government, by industry and the consumer is necessary to turn the tide.</p><p>Why are we pursuing enforcement online?  Again, the answer is simple.  That's where crime is taking us.  The days of counterfeiting and copyright theft occurring solely through the mails, on the streets, or through our ports are over.  Today these crimes are just as likely to occur on the corner of 4th and -- over the Internet as they are on the corner of 4th and Main.</p><p>Let me be clear here.  We are investigating crimes online because copyright thieves and counterfeiters have led us there.  We are not seeking to regulate the Internet.  We are not out to stifle free speech.  We are not out to trample anyone's constitutional rights. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false, full stop.</p><p>We're a law enforcement agency out to deter and prevent crime; nothing more, nothing less.  Crime is crime wherever it occurs, and we do not accept the view that the Internet should somehow be off limits to enforcement if it is knowingly being used to commit crimes.</p><p>So what is ICE doing to combat the problem?  Well, we're making IP enforcement a priority for the agency and pursuing a record number of IP cases.  Last fiscal year, for example, we opened over a thousand new IP investigations, the largest number in our agency history.</p><p>Wherever we can, we pursue the traditional investigative model. That is, we investigate the alleged crime, we seize the contraband, we arrest and prosecute the perpetrators.  That approach doesn't always work well, however on online cases, as online crime is frequently centered overseas and outside of our legal jurisdiction.</p><p>Take an online counterfeiting site, for example.  More often than not, the server, the criminals and the counterfeiting operation are all outside of the U.S.  The same is true for infringing sites; nothing need be based in the U.S.</p><p>As a result, we've also seized 119 domain names of sites used to sell counterfeit goods and to illegally distribute copyrighted materials -- 119 sites, mind you, out of well over 200 million on the Internet.  The majority of the sites were linked to counterfeiting of hard goods; the rest were involved in illegal streaming or downloads of entertainment or software.</p><p>Please note that we are not targeting lawful businesses, blogs or discussion boards.  The sites we go after are commercial and have engaged in repeated and significant violation of the law.  They're increasingly sophisticated and often seek to dupe consumers.</p><p>I don't know if we can throw up -- so here's just two quick examples.</p><p>Here's a website purporting to be a Louis -- an authorized Louis Vuitton outlet, and it offers Louis Vuitton products and, I quote, \"100 percent handmade from France.\"  The website has the Louis Vuitton logo, name and design.  What's missing, of course, are any genuine Louis Vuitton products.  Instead, none of the products are handmade in France, but they're all counterfeit in China and shipped to the United States.</p><p>The next slide, if you would.  This is allegedly an authorized retailer of Nike shoes, another site that we seized.  In fact, none of these shoes are authorized or made by Nike; they're all counterfeit. And here you have Nike, one of the major U.S. manufacturers based in Oregon, and it is if not the most targeted, one of the most targeted companies in terms of counterfeiting.</p><p>Let me close very quickly by saying we've spent a lot of time and attention on process.  We can talk about that more in detail.  I also recognize that good people can have different views on how to solve counterfeiting and copyright infringement.  That's OK.  I don't pretend to have all of the answers.  Addressing online crime is not an easy task, and criminal investigation is but one part of the solution.</p><p>I do know this, however, Mr. Chairman:  if we do nothing to keep pace with online criminals or give up this fight, little good will come of it.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you, Mr. Morton.</p><p>Mr. Abrams, welcome.</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and to offer a few First Amendment views on the topic you have.  You've got three competing, sometimes overlapping, themes here today.  We deal with the Internet, which is probably the greatest enabler of free speech, by everyone, in the history of the world.</p><p>We deal with the copyright law, which is a great enabler of free speech by providing a basis for people to engage in it, to create, and to profit from it.  And we deal with the First Amendment, which limits the ability of government in many areas to control free speech.</p><p>That we deal with the Internet does not mean that we are dealing with an entity that is so unique that we must act as if we are in a law-free zone.  The law is the same with respect to libel on the Internet as it is with respect to libel in a newspaper.  The law is the same with respect to invasion of privacy on the Internet as it is with respect to television broadcasts.  And the law is the same with respect to copyright on the Internet and off the Internet.</p><p>It is simply then not so for some people to suggest that the Internet is -- that it's the Wild West and that we should leave it that way.  Even the Wild West had sheriffs, and even those who use the Internet have to abide by our laws.</p><p>Now, how should you address the question which every member of this committee has agreed is a significant one -- and indeed a dangerous one, as it currently exists -- in a way that complies with the First Amendment?  First, any legislation has to be narrowly drafted, really narrowly drafted so it only impacts websites, domains that are all but totally infringing.  We don't want a situation, either as a matter of public policy and certainly not as a matter of the First Amendment, where we're wiping out, in a some sense, or blocking in any sense, protected speech.</p><p>But if an entity, as so many of the ones at issue here are, is nothing but a transmitter of infringing products -- which is to say, acting criminally under our laws -- you are permitted to deal with that, so long as you do so without getting into an overbroad situation.</p><p>I suggest to you that so far as you can, you ought to base any legislation on the -- a law that currently exists.  You don't have to start from scratch, as if there is nothing that can guide you.  We have a copyright law; we have means of enforcement.  Injunctions have been issued by courts since 1790 when the copyright law was first enacted by Congress, before we even had a Bill of Rights.</p><p>I would recommend to you that any legislation should include some reference to, and I would urge inclusion, of Federal Rule 65, which is the rule of civil procedure which deals with the modalities of assuring that people have notice to appear, that judges don't have to issue injunctions but that they may do so, and which provides great procedural protections for all that may be affected by legislation.</p><p>And I would simply sum up what I have to say in greater length in my prepared statement by saying that by enacting legislation in this area, we are not abdicating America's leadership of the world with respect to freedom on the Internet.  We are simply enforcing well established, deeply rooted, frequently abided by -- until rather recently -- copyright law which exists for the purpose of furthering free expression in the first place.</p><p>There's no constitutional right to steal someone else's intellectual property, and I urge the committee to act with that in mind.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you, Mr. Abrams.</p><p>Mr. Walker, welcome.</p><p>You want to hit the button there and turn your mic on.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  (Chuckles.)  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Watt, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, members of the committee.</p><p>As you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, before I joined Google I was a federal prosecutor.  As an assistant United States attorney, I prosecuted cyber crime; I brought some of the first cases against criminal copyright enforcement in the country.  I recognize the challenges and the difficulties of protecting intellectual property online.</p><p>The legal issues that we'll discuss today are complex and challenging.  They require thoughtful approaches to preserve and enhance the benefits of the Internet for consumers and businesses in America and the world.  And Google is dedicated to addressing issues of online copyright infringement and counterfeiting.</p><p>We know that the future growth and the success of our industry relies on fighting the bad guys who break the law.  And we stand ready to support further enforcement measures against rogue foreign websites, focusing on financial transactions and advertising where those measures are appropriate and narrowly targeted against the worst of the worst foreign websites, in line with Mr. Abrams' comments this morning.</p><p>We do have concerns, however, about extending new law to dictate natural search results.  We'd like to work together to ensure that these efforts are effective, while not harming legitimate services and technologies that drive U.S. economic growth and our country's leadership in the global information economy.</p><p>Let me share several ways that Google combats copyright infringement and counterfeiting, and then discuss principles for how to address rogue foreign websites.</p><p>At YouTube, as Mr. Chairman, you recognized, we designed a powerful tool that rightsholders use to block or monetize infringing content.  Our content I.D. system, developed using 50,000 engineering hours at a cost of over $30 million, scans every video uploaded to YouTube and typically within seconds compares it against more than 4 million reference files provided by rightsholders.</p><p>Today over a thousand media companies, including every major U.S. studio and record label, use content I.D., and most of them choose to monetize, rather than to block the content.  This shows the win-win possibilities that Internet technologies can bring, getting money to rightsholders and innovative services to users.</p><p>When it comes to online services like our search engine, a major part of the explosive growth of the Internet in the United States and around the world is due to the strong legal foundation created by Congress in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p><p>Last year Google processed over 3 million DMCA takedowns across our products, including search.  These came from copyright owners of all sorts -- big movie studios to small publishers of needlepoint patterns.</p><p>And currently Google engineers are building new tools so we can act in reliable copyright takedown requests on our search engine within 24 hours.  We're already testing the new tool with a content industry partner and we hope to invite other partners into that test in the weeks ahead.</p><p>When copyright owners tell us about infringements, we disable access to the infringing content, whether that content comes from foreign or domestic sources.  The shared responsibility of the DMCA works.  It assures that online platforms like Google or Facebook or Twitter will not face crippling liability when users post comments or files to online sites.</p><p>And as we committed last year, we're already excluding several piracy-related terms from appearing in autocomplete, a feature on Google that predicts queries as users type, and we've asked content industry representatives to provide other terms for consideration.</p><p>Turning to our advertising programs, in AdSense we prohibit ads on infringing web pages and we use automated and manual review to weed out abuse.  Last year alone we took action on our own initiative against over 12,000 sites for violating that policy.</p><p>To address counterfeiting, our policies ban selling ads to advertisers who market counterfeit goods, and they always have.  We use automated tools to prevent violations of our policies and last year alone we invested over $60 million in these efforts.  After all, a Google user who's duped by a fake good is less likely to click on another Google ad.  For the integrity of the sponsored links on our site is of paramount importance to us.</p><p>In the last six months of 2010 alone we shut down 50,000 accounts for attempting to advertise counterfeit goods.  And 95 percent of those shutdowns came not as a result of a complaint, but as a result of our own efforts.  And while it sounds like a lot, and it is, the legitimate -- complaints we received concern less than one-quarter of 1 percent of advertisers.</p><p>We've also committed to an average response time of 24 hours to handle counterfeit complaints involving sponsored links, and that too is in process and should be rolling out fairly soon.</p><p>So finally, as you address the challenge of rogue foreign sites, I would ask that you keep in mind the following three points:  First, aim squarely at the worst of the worst foreign websites without hurting legitimate technologies and businesses.  We agree with the goal of going after websites that are outside the reach of U.S. law and whose main purpose is commercial infringement.</p><p>Procedural safeguards are critical, though, to ensure due process and to avoid mistakes costing legitimate businesses the use of their domain name.</p><p>Second, don't re-write the DMCA, an existing law that works. Businesses benefit from stable and predictable rules with clear standards.  Targeted legislation to address rogue foreign websites must not inadvertently dismantle the legal framework that America's technology companies and innovators rely upon.</p><p>The DMCA strikes the right balance between thwarting infringement and preserving free speech, and we should build upon it, not undermine it.</p><p>Third and last, tailor intermediary obligations appropriately. Let me repeat:  Google is open to working with the subcommittee on additional enforcement tools.  Search engines already remove infringement by domestic and foreign sources, so we think it's right for additional measures to focus on financial transaction providers and advertising services, both of which Google provides.  But any legislation should avoid a private right of action that would invite shakedowns against companies making good-faith efforts to comply with the law.</p><p>To sum up, these are complex issues.  We need to address the enforcement problems while protecting the overwhelmingly positive benefits of the Internet for our country and the world.  And we look forward to working with each of you to do just that.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you, Mr. Walker.</p><p>Ms. Jones, we're pleased to have your testimony.</p><p>MS. JONES:  Good morning, Chairman Goodlatte.  Thanks so much for the opportunity to be heard today.</p><p>You know, we put a of time and energy into getting rid of bad actors from the Internet at Go Daddy, so we sincerely appreciate that you guys have made parasites a priority for the subcommittee this Congress.</p><p>And I also want to extend my personal thanks to Ranking Member Watt and Chairman Smith and Ranking member Conyers of the full committee as well and, frankly, all the members of the subcommittee, because I spend a lot of my personal time on these issues, not because I have to, but because I think it's the right thing to do.  And let me tell you, it's nice to know that I have an ally in this fight, because sometimes we feel like we're out there all by ourselves.</p><p>Having worked closely with law enforcement, the intellectual property community and others on a wide variety of issues related to parasites, it is clear to me that we still have a long way to go.</p><p>I'll be the first to admit that there is no silver bullet.  No silver bullet; it doesn't exist.  Just like in offline crimes, it appears there will always be bad guys on the Internet; that is a stark reality we all must face.  And although some of us have done a lot, there is still a lot more that some can do.  So let's talk about what that looks like.</p><p>We have had great success in the past with a hybrid approach to illegal content.  That means voluntary industry cooperation on the one hand, among all of the industry players, accompanied by targeted, specific federal legislation designed to protect the companies that are doing the right thing, but provide a consequence for those who do not.  We've used this approach in addressing child pornography, for example, to great effect.</p><p>And Go Daddy and Google recently worked together with the White House Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator to gather representatives from all of the major industry players to address rogue online pharmacies.  We feel like we're making progress there as well.</p><p>That effort resulted in the formation of a group known as the Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies.  That group's mission is to share information among all of the players, work together to terminate services for illegal online drug sellers.  Whatever your service is -- if you're a payment card provider, if you're a paid advertising provider, if you're a domain name registrar, whatever it is, turn off your services.  We feel like that hybrid approach there is going to make it possible for us to address a significant number of illegal drug sellers who operate online today.</p><p>So we support that type of hybrid approach to address a variety of types of criminal activity, such as child abuse, rogue pharmacies, spam, phishing, identity theft, intellectual property infringement, terrorism, hate speech, on and on and on.  We think it works in all of those situations.</p><p>Of course, it's always just as important to focus on enforcement as it is to enact new legislation.  To do that, we would suggest a few simple things.  I think Ranking Member Conyers mentioned this in his statement; that is, follow the money.  Shut down all of the choke points in the system, because we have to disincentive the bad actors. So in the IP context, for example, we would take away the ability to search for, pay for, ship and make money from selling stolen or counterfeit goods.</p><p>But we have to do that while encouraging new innovation and research and development.  One thing we know is that the better we get, the better we get.  That means we have to think of things we can hardly even imagine right now.</p><p>So what happens, for instance, in the case of cyber lockers or infringing mobile applications or whatever infringement is going to come up that's invented in the future?  If we establish a set of rules and procedures such as the DMCA which can be applied to a wide array of situations, we can possibly address those things that aren't, as if they were.  None of us can predict the next big thing.  I mean, who knows what's the next eBay or AOL or Netscape or Go Daddy or Google or Twitter?  Who knows?</p><p>Not so long ago there was a monopoly for selling domain names. Nobody had ever heard of an Internet browser or even a search engine. The term \"social media\" didn't exist; it's common understanding now. And not too long from now there's going to be another idea like that that nobody's ever heard of.  We have to think in terms of concepts rather than URLs or domain names or IP addresses or whatever to make legislation that's designed to outlast the current ideas.  And because these issues reach outside our borders, we should all take steps to bind our foreign affiliates to the actions that we take here in the United States.</p><p>A huge number of our customers make a living operating online businesses.  That's how they make their money.  And their ability to continue to do so is very important to us.  We would challenge our counterparts in the Internet ecosystem to do what we do at Go Daddy; that is, to voluntarily take action against the people that we know to be using our system for illicit purposes, and that includes registrars, registries, hosting providers, payment processors, shippers, ISPs, search engines, online advertising providers and oh, by the way, whoever joins the community next, whoever that is, we challenge them all to make the same commitment.</p><p>And I would submit that unless and until we provide a consequence for the businesses that facilitate criminals in their systems, there will always be a safe harbor, a place where crooks can go to engage in crimes online, and we must fix that hole in the fence.</p><p>Thank you very much for the time.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you, Ms. Jones.</p><p>And I'll recognize myself to begin the questioning.  And let me warn my committee members, I may take a little extra time here because I want to go into some detail with this issue, with some specific examples.</p><p>And let me say at the outset that I want to restate my belief that tech and content, two areas in which this committee has great interest, are not enemies and that they both bring innovation to the table to solve various problems and they need each other and we need both of them contributing to solve this problem.</p><p>And Mr. Walker, let me just say I'm a -- I'm an avid user of Google's search engine and I welcome your comments here today that you want to work with the committee on some legislative solutions that might involve your company and other -- other players in the tech community in this.  And we -- and we hear your concerns as well.</p><p>And I want to commend you for a news release which I'll put in the record that says, \"Google Boots Grooveshark from Android Market,\" and noted that this was done yesterday.  Grooveshark is a music app that has been found by many of the top music labels to be violating copyright law, and a Google spokesman said, \"We remove apps from the Android market that violate our terms of service,\" and it was also noted that we were having a hearing on the subject here today.  But we commend you for that.</p><p>I want to go into some details about some of the things we found in recent searches, however.  In preparation for today's hearing we conducted searches in Google for \"free MP3 Taylor Swift,\" quote- unquote.</p><p>Over the past several days, the first page of each search return appeared to show all unlicensed sites.  We checked with the distributor of Taylor Swift's recordings and they provided us three screen shots from yesterday that show only two authorized sites out of nearly 30.  To access the first of those, a consumer would have to scroll past the first 14 suggested by Google.</p><p>You wrote recently that Google was, quote, \"a big fan of making authorized content more accessible,\" end quote, four months ago, and yet this is the result.  I intend to check in a week, in a month, in three months and six months.  When I do that, will I find this same problem in existence?  What is Google doing about this?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me go to the Grooveshark example first.  I want to flag that is not the first time we've removed items from that app store.  We removed almost 2,000 different applications from the app store over time -- (word inaudible) -- 2 (hundred) or 300 in February alone.</p><p>So we continue to look not just for copyright infringement, but now we're in many other things.  There is -- you can recognize, I believe, about 200,000 different applications, so it's a major challenge for us to go through all those, but we are -- (inaudible).</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  And we commend you for that.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  With regard to the additional items in the search results, we do try and remove -- when we get notice of these individual infringing items, obviously we try and take them down.  At the same time, we have said we're eager to work with the content industry on ways of making their sites more accessible.</p><p>In some cases when they offer preview content or other kinds of things where you can listen to 30 seconds or a minute or a trial copy of a song, for example, that's very attractive to users.  And we talk with them about ways of partnering that would actually make that more visible within the snippets, within the search results returned.  And so as you get users clicking on that, that's sort of a natural signal. The cream rises to the top, even as we try and pull the bad guys out.</p><p>Now, that said, the Internet's a big place.  And as I think all the witnesses have said, we're never going to get rid of all the bad guys.  We play the whack-a-mole problem as much as the content industry does, and it frustrates us.  And when you hear me talk about taking down 50,000 sites for this or 12,000 accounts for that, that's cost us a lot of time and effort.  It drives us crazy trying to get rid of these guys because, of course, we take them down in one place, they come back up in another place using a different credit card, using a different IP address.  So it is a constant battle.</p><p>We think the best way to fight that battle is collaboratively. To your point about the content industry and the technology industry working together, we're in the best position to rapidly remove content and build tools and filters to help do that.</p><p>The content industry is in the best position, maybe unique position, to let us know what's authorized and what's not.  Because, of course, there are multiple authorized sites for different kinds of songs.  The music industry is a very complicated place with label rights and publisher rights that expire over times and different geographies and the like.</p><p>They know what's authorized and what's not, and we rely on them to let us know, and then we take action.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Let me -- let me follow up on that.  I have indicated I use Google frequently.  I'm frequently amazed at the sophistication of the algorithms that you use in your -- in your search process.  And I often, when I type in things I like to see, you know, how many letters I  have to type in before Google knows what I'm looking for.  And I'm -- am frequently very impressed.</p><p>Three days ago we conducted a search for \"watch movies online.\" We typed in those words.  Without prompting, the first suggestion that appeared in the drop-down box that comes --which is exactly what I'm talking about, anticipating what I want -- in the drop-down box the first suggestion was \"watch free bootleg movies online.\"  And I'm sure, as a former federal prosecutor, you know the meaning of the term \"bootleg.\"</p><p>If you click, you go to a results page full of infringing links. Clicking on one of the sites at the top of the page takes you to a website that is a notorious infringing site.  It even advertises \"pre- release movies.\"  We have a movie coming out on Friday that they're advertising now will be available online illegally, that's going to appear -- \"Hanna\" is the movie, and it's going to appear in the theaters on Friday and you'll be able to see it online on Friday too, apparently.  It even advertises pre-release movies.</p><p>Why exactly does Google suggest to users that they click on \"watch free bootleg movies online\"?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  So the functionality you're speaking to is referred to as autocomplete.  It's essentially the sum of what other users are doing.  And so it's not really Google knowing what you want; it's you asking for things that other users are interested in.</p><p>And the fact that some of these terms come actually reinforces the importance of education among the American public.  Because it's a reflection of how many users are in fact trying to seek illegal bootlegs, pirated, otherwise infringing content out there.  Now --</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Well, let me ask you this.  Would Google think it appropriate to -- when these things are called to your attention, review your -- the things that you anticipate and put up there and block some of them from occurring?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Absolutely.  In fact, we've committed to do just that.  And the challenge in doing it, obviously, is making sure that the terms we're blocking are uniquely -- or highly correlated with infringing material and not with -- with other sort of material.</p><p>So, for example, if you put in \"cheap\" or \"free,\" many of those are perfectly appropriate and legitimate searches.  You wouldn't want to not suggest that.  Even terms like, you know, \"faux\" or \"replica\" in many cases it's faux leather or faux -- or even, you know, to go farther, terms like, you know, \"knockoff.\"  There are knockoff dresses that are sold by Macy's and Nordstrom.</p><p>We have to figure out what are the list of terms that really are pushing people to something that's almost unambiguously, to Mr. Abrams' point, infringing material.  And we have started that process, and in fact we are in dialogue with the content community to ask them what are your key terms?  What terms would you like us to include in that list, and how can we do that analysis and move forward?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you.  Let me follow up on that.</p><p>As I think you know, many members of the subcommittee are interested in your December 2 policy blog post regarding steps that Google would take to address the growing number of issues involving the use of its services in connection with copyright infringement.</p><p>Interesting among them was a pledge to, quote, \"prevent terms that are closely associated with piracy from appearing in autocomplete.  The Google feature, whereby Google's search engine will suggest search terms to its users as the users type, based on its prediction of what they might be looking for.\"</p><p>As you know, I am the co-chair of the bicameral Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus, along with Congressman Adam Schiff. Last year we released our annual international piracy watch list which included six foreign websites that are notorious for providing access to infringing copies of works by U.S. creators.</p><p>These included sites like The Pirate Bay, whose principals have been criminally convicted for their activities in Europe, and isoHunt, which is a file-sharing site that is the subject of an injunction issued by a U.S. court for copyright inducement and whose owner is described by another federal court as, quote, \"an admitted copyright thief.\"  I am told that a review of the 15 sites identified six weeks ago by the USTR as notorious markets for piracy show nearly identical results.</p><p>In other words, Google continues to suggest each one of those sites as search terms through the autocomplete function.  I'd like to know what you're doing to address this problem, and if you're doing your best to prevent terms that are closely associated with piracy from appearing in autocomplete, again, obviously somebody looking for something, they can type out that whole word and won't get to it.  But I think it would help Google's reputation as not aiding and abetting the infringement by not having these pop up on your autocomplete.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  We understand the optics of it and we are working on it.  I think it's an extension of our prior conversation.</p><p>The challenge is that a lot of those sites are Broadbase sites. The Chinese search engine Baidu, for example, I believe appears on that list.  And Baidu does allow a large amount of pirated and infringing material to be accessible through its search engine, and yet we're in a difficult situation, essentially discriminating against this search competitor and bleeping him out of autocomplete.</p><p>So I think it's -- certainly the answer here would be the same as before, which is we really want to identify things that are unambiguously infringement and we are open to removing those from the autocomplete list.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you, Mr. Walker.  I appreciate your answering those difficult questions.  And to not single you entirely out, I have one for Ms. Jones.</p><p>You mentioned that Go Daddy strongly prefers DNS blocking by registrars, registries, to DNS filtering by ISPs as a strategy to shut down rogue websites because DNS filtering will not provide 100 percent protection.  Is DSN blocking, as you describe it, effective against websites hosted and registered through overseas companies, and doesn't DNS filtering provide a better way to disable access to those types of foreign-based websites?  Should both types of technologies be employed to combat the problem?</p><p>MS. JONES:  To answer your last question first, yes, I think that is absolutely necessary and it's a pretty complicated technical explanation.  I'll try not to get too much into the weeds.</p><p>But if you block DNS as the definitive root level, nobody can access the website from anywhere.  The problem comes where you don't have cooperation from entities who are willing to do the blocking. And then you -- if you want to block at least some access, you may have to engage in some filtering.  And we know that both blocking and filtering take place today in a variety of contexts.</p><p>The Internet community is a little bit remiss to employ these kind of tactics because the more you filter, the more you splinter, the less stable and secure the root becomes.  And you end up with a giant grid of -- a three-dimensional grid, actually -- of things that are blocked by people, from people, in various geographies, and it gets -- it gets very shaky.</p><p>So really, that suggestion is more of a technical -- a technical approach, as opposed to a policy approach or a policy belief.  But, you know, one of the -- (chuckles).  Well, I was going to answer one of Mr. Walker's questions, but I know I'm not allowed to ask questions here, so I'll just leave it at that.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  That's good advice to yourself.  (Laughter.)</p><p>And now -- now I'll recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.</p><p>REP. WATT:  I can't resist.  I've got to let her answer whatever question she wanted to answer.  (Laughter.)  if she's willing to answer it, I'm willing to listen to the answer.</p><p>MS. JONES:  It just occurred to me that once in a while we have foreign websites that we can't block because they're -- (word inaudible) -- and we don't have a good cooperative U.S. company that's willing to do it.  But so the example that the ICE gentleman put up here of the fake Louis Vuitton or the fake Nike, those are almost certainly -- I don't know.  I haven't looked them up, but they're almost certainly at foreign registrars and foreign hosting providers, and they won't take them down.</p><p>But that -- no offense, Mr. Walker, but that doesn't mean that we can't disable the search to those.  Because I can almost guarantee you that Louis Vuitton and Nike have contacted somebody to say, could you please stop sending people to those websites?  It is an approach.  And now he's going to have to --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  And if I can --</p><p>REP. WATT:  Well, what do you say to that, Mr. Walker?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah.  (Chuckles.)  Thank you, sir.  It's exactly right.  I'm sure we are contacted by many of those sites and we remove them, and that's the way the system should work.</p><p>I mean, Louis Vuitton and Nike are in the best position to know what's appropriate and what's not.  In many cases, when you put those search terms in, you may get ads for competitors, for example, and that's a good thing.  Now you've -- competitive advertising, comparative advertising helps consumers.  It helps them find out about more products that are out there, pay less money for them.  If you're looking -- (inaudible).</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p>REP. WATT:  What do you say to that, Ms. Jones?</p><p>MS. JONES:  I happen to hear from the Louis Vuitton and Nike lawyers all day every day, and they're very, very willing to tell you which sites they want you to take down.  So I don't have the data from any of the other providers, except for the ones that I represent, so I don't know if they have the list.  But I would be shocked if they hadn't provided those.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Mr. Morton, would it be more effective to block them or filter them?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Well, the -- as Ms. Jones noted, this gets very complicated, the sort of technical arrangements.  What I'll say is first of all, on those sites, they weren't seized or terminated by industry.  We seized them on both of those sites.  We seized them and we forfeited both of those sites because they were notorious counterfeiting sites and they were referred to us by industry, and those are the instances in which you can have good cooperation between the government.</p><p>I think what you've heard going before suggests, however, that industry can do a lot more and on a much greater scale than government ever can be.  We are part of the solution; we are not the solution, by a long shot.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Mr. Abrams, any free speech implications in any of these -- and of those situations?</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  You know, everything we're talking about today is suffused with a danger of free speech violation.  We don't want Google taking down sites just because people are angry at them or upset.  We don't want the public to have less access unless we're talking about genuinely infringing or otherwise criminally or civilly violative sites.</p><p>It seems to me that the hard issue here is that we're often talking about taking down an infringing movie, say, taking down an infringing design, when the real problem is very often that these sites are only infringing sites.  Everything on them is infringing.</p><p>And there the question is, as a congressional matter, what can you do about that?  That's what the Senate focused on in its attempt to draft legislation.  And I suggest to you that when you focus on drafting anything, that you ought to propose legislation which focuses not just on individual files, not an individual movie or an individual design only, but on the sites themselves which contain them.  And --</p><p>REP. WATT:  But wouldn't -- wouldn't a convenient way, quick way around that be just to put --</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear the --</p><p>REP. WATT:  Wouldn't a quick way around that be just to put up some legitimate -- put some legitimate stuff on the same site?  I mean, seldom are you going to have a criminal that's not -- if you tell him that all you're doing is taking down sites that are exclusively dedicated to criminal activity, he's going to mix in a little -- a little legitimate stuff, don't you think?</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  Well, that's a fair point, and therefore what I'm talking about will never be a complete solution.  But law enforcement authorities deal with that when they deal with, what, stores that sell, what, 90 percent of child pornography?  They can close down the store in that circumstance.</p><p>If you get to a much lower amount, A, you've done something. You've accomplished something, I think, of a serious public policy nature.  And then yes, you have to go after the individual sale of an individual book.</p><p>All I'm saying is that it is a step forward to try to deal with these sites, which is the reality, as I understand it, today where there are many sites which are either nothing but, or almost nothing but, infringing entities.</p><p>REP. WATT:  I'm sure I have many more questions, Mr. Chairman, but out of respect to the other members, I'll come back around the next time, I guess.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentleman.</p><p>The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Quayle, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BEN QUAYLE (R-AZ):  Thank you -- thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing.</p><p>Because annually billions of dollars are being stolen through pirated or counterfeit goods, and the last hearing that we had, a number of us, including myself, had mentioned some of our concern of how illegal streaming was being treated.</p><p>And I'm actually very pleased that the IP enforcement coordinated a victory.  (Word inaudible) -- did a white paper recently which states that illegal streaming should be a felony and not a misdemeanor, as it currently is.  And I know the chairman of this subcommittee and the full committee have been working on this, and I look forward to seeing a piece of legislation soon.</p><p>I'd also like to specifically thank Mr. Morton and ICE for all of their -- all their good work in enforcement against illegitimate sites, and I thank you for being here today.</p><p>But my first question is for you, Mr. Walker.  Now, does Google currently have algorithms in place that allow ads that are paid for to show up during search results, based on the search terms that are placed into the query?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yes.  That's fundamentally how our -- what's called the ad word side of our business works.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  And so those algorithms are basically personalized for each search result, based on the search terms that are utilized, correct?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  They're personalized based on a lot of different factors.  So for example -- in a different part of country, different time of day, different time of season, et cetera.  But there's a correlation that takes a lot of things into account.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  And are these updated regularly?  Daily, weekly, monthly?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Almost instantaneously, because it looks at the quality of different websites, the amounts that different advertisers are paying, user preference.  The more users click on an ad, the more popular it becomes and therefore more relevant.  So a lot of factors that go into that.  But it's almost in real time.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Look, I went to law school.  I didn't -- wasn't an engineer, so that sounds --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah, that makes -- that makes two of us. (Inaudible.)</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  That sounds pretty sophisticated.  So based on that, I mean, Google has very extremely sophisticated algorithms that it uses in its search -- in its search results and queries.  And because of that, Google has really become a noun and not just a verb. But based on that, you know, a recent report stated that domains classified as digital piracy attracted 32 million daily visits.</p><p>Do you think that a company that has sophisticated algorithms like Google could create an algorithm in which search requests using words that are among the most frequently associated with the crime are able to filter out those results?  Have you ever -- have they tried to do this, or have you chosen not to?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah, I -- the challenge is that it's sort of a different kettle of fish.  The different (tasks ?) to solve.  In the context of trying to come up with what's most relevant or related to a key word, taking all those different factors into account, you can use user feedback, as I referred to.</p><p>If lots of users, if you rank something fourth and all your users click on that, well, you probably made a mistake and it  probably should be ranking higher, and vice versa.  In the context of trying to target what's authorized and what's unauthorized on the web, that's a much harder challenge.</p><p>And the feedback loop we use there is essentially DMCA notices. We referred to before our process for when we get a notice of something from the rights holder, then we know it's illegal and we remove the link from our system.  We don't just demote it; we take it out entirely.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Well, I remember an article in The New York Times -- I think it was earlier this year, regarding J.C. Penney and how it had been pushed to the top of the search results for everything from skinny jeans to grommeted-top curtains.  Anything that you put into the search query in Google came up J.C. Penney.</p><p>Now, when you guys were actually notified of this, you changed your algorithm so that that wouldn't happen.  How can you not then use that type of sophistication that you do -- I mean, I know you just explained that portion of it, but I think that it would seem to be feasible that those common search terms that are used to find pirated works on the Internet could be put into the algorithm so that those searches, then, the results are actually filtered out --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  There are two problems there.  I mean, one is that a lot of times searches, queries that are used to find pirated stuff are also used to find all sorts of other things as well.  The word \"cheap\" or \"discount\" that I talked about before.  So you're trying to separate the wheat from the chaff.  That's problem one; you don't want to be over-inclusive and knock out a lot of legitimate sites.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Right.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Problem two is figuring out what the wheat is.  And there we need to partner with the content industry, because there are lots of sites out there that make fair use of items, that have remixes and different sorts of things that are protected under the DMCA, again, that we don't want to knock out.  So we rely on the content industry to say, you know, that's bad.  That site is bad; pull that -- (inaudible).</p><p>You know, we don't want -- and I don't think the members of the committee want us or any company to be the judge, jury and executioner against an entire site.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  No, I agree with that.  But you've got to understand the frustration.  I think Google does understand the frustration of those that have copyrighted work that's being infringed.  Because recently just last week you reached a settlement, Google did, with six companies in which Google was suing because the companies were misusing Google's trademarks and name.  in addition, I've read other pending lawsuits Google's involved in over domain names that are oddly similar to Google's domain name and logo.</p><p>In all of these instances, other companies were profiting off of Google.  So I think I -- you can see where I'm going with this.  I think you can understand the frustration of copyright holders, because they are having their content being illegally sold via the top results from searches on your search engine, and they are actually making a profit from that.</p><p>So can Google play a more proactive role in this, in combatting some of the deliberate, illegal sites and without infringing on any other parts of it?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah, I think -- I think we can.  And look, we not only understand the frustration, we share it.  As you said, we're a big IP owner ourselves.  We went after some bad guys who were misusing our name in scammy sort of ways that were misleading consumers.  You know, \"Buy the Google work-at-home kit,\" which of course had no association with Google, and pay 100 bucks to get a bunch of worthless paper.  And we went after those guys and won that case.</p><p>And we're committed to doing that again for all these bad guys when we can identify them and clearly know who to go after.  It's one thing for us, though, to be able to remove the individual links to stuff that we can look at and say, yeah, that's infringing, and another to try and go after the entire domain.  That's a harder procedural thing for us as a private company to do.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank the gentleman.</p><p>The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the judiciary committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers.  And as I do that, I'll ask the vice chairman of the committee, Mr. Quayle, to take the chair.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  Thank you.</p><p>Attorney Christine Jones, why can't your organization build intellectual property protections into its user agreements and terminate customers that provide or facilitate online piracy?</p><p>MS. JONES:  I'm sorry, I missed that last word.  Online -- privacy?</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  Piracy.</p><p>MS. JONES:  Oh, piracy.  I think we do substantially build those protections into our agreements, and the agreements are written generally very broadly.  Like Google and other providers, we do rely on the content industry to let us know when they find things that are inappropriate.</p><p>But what we do that's somewhat more aggressive than most is if there is some infringing content and the person who runs the website doesn't cure it, we disable the entire website.  Because you either are engaged in unlawful activity or you're not.  There's no such thing as halfway.  So if your domain name contains bad stuff and you don't take it down, we kill the entire domain.  Period.  If you fix it, we'll put it back up.</p><p>But we don't incentivize people to make part of their website good and part of their website bad, because as our First Amendment professor -- I'd call him a professor -- says, some it's good and some of it's bad and you have to be able to make a decision.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  You say you're doing it already?</p><p>MS. JONES:  I think we do it already, yes, to the extent that we can.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  Mr. Kent Walker, when someone types in \"child pornography\" into a Google search, Google doesn't connect the user to images of child abuse.  Now, that means to me that the technology exists to block illegal material from appearing in your searches.</p><p>Why don't you employ the same technology to block searches for illegal content and the illegal goods?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  When it comes to child pornography, we do two things that are unique, compared to the problem of online counterfeiting and infringing material.  Child pornography is recognizable to some degree with filters.</p><p>You can build a filter that'll detect flesh tones, for example. It knows flesh tones.  The -- and that gives you a clue, and then you can use human reviewers to look at the sites one at a time.  And to some degree, as the Supreme Court has put it, you know it when you see it.  And we have people who are working on that.</p><p>In the context of unauthorized goods where it's not clear who's got the legal rights to something, it's much harder.  You may remember the case that Viacom brought against YouTube not long ago.  Viacom itself sued us over thousands of clips from their files that they had actually authorized -- they or their subsidiaries had authorized be uploaded to YouTube.  So they themselves didn't actually know what was legitimate or what wasn't.</p><p>And that -- it's a harder problem.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  So why -- what's the -- why can't you block the searches?  Tell me the answer again.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  We can, in cooperation with the content owner.  If they'd let us know that a given item is unauthorized, we -- we block that through.  So we take that link out of our results, if it's for copyright infringement.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  Can I ask the director of ICE, I'm glad you didn't mention all the lack of due diligence and collateral damage that occurred February in your organization during recent seizures where legitimate sites were taken down in droves.  Do you want to admit that before we get to the question?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Either way.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  What do you mean, either way?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  If you want to continue the question --</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  I mean, do you (admit ?) that that happened?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  What happened in that case, Ranking Member Conyers, was this.  That wasn't an IP investigation; it had to do with child pornography.  We were investigating 10 sites that were offering images of children as young as four and five engaged in --  you know, in sexual --</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  Yeah, but how did you get the good guys involved? Because that -- that's what I'm getting to.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  What happened in that particular case was that in one of -- in one of the 10 sites that we were seizing, the seizure was overbroad and the site we were going after was a subdomain of a secondary domain level.  And we seized for a little less than two days more than that site.</p><p>All the sites we -- two people contacted us.  We noticed our error and we put all the sites back up.</p><p>REP. CONYERS:  OK.  Last question, with your forbearance, Mr. Chairman, to Professor Abrams.</p><p>What did you think of the Senate attempt on the same subject we're working on?</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  I thought the Senate attempt was constitutional.  I think the notion of trying to define a rogue site in a way which requires, you know, a very stiff showing -- and a very difficult, but a possible showing of a site itself or the domain itself being so devoted --dedicated, in the draft statute's language -- to infringement works.</p><p>And I think that it works in a way which goes beyond the simple question of what can happen to that site.  It deals -- it raises issues at least about intermediaries.  I mean, if you have a court and the court says this whole site at this moment, as it is today, this whole site is an infringing site, and you get a court order to that effect and you serve it on ISPs, it seems to me perfectly constitutional to require the ISP not to carry material from the site.</p><p>And that would be true of other intermediaries as well, at least with respect to direct links to the site.  I mean, I don't think you can limit information about the sites; I don't think -- I don't think Google can be limited any more than The Washington Post can be limited in writing about, containing a summary, describing, mentioning the website involved.</p><p>But I think intermediaries might well be able to be limited after being served with a finding by a court from linking to a site that has been held by a court to be an infringing one.</p><p>REP. QUAYLE:  Thank you.  The chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Coble, for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HOWARD COBLE (R-NC):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's good to have you all with us, I'll say to the panel.</p><p>Mr. Abrams, I think you touched on this.  I was going to ask you how precise does the definition of rogue websites need to be in order to be constitutionally sound, but I think -- did you want to add anything to it?  I think you've touched on that.</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  Not really.  I mean, obviously language has to be very carefully drafted, but I think the notion, at least, of the Senate bill which focuses on dedicated-to-infringing with no other commercial purpose than infringing, which as I said, it's a very tough standard to meet.  But if that can be met, I don't think there's a constitutional right of that site anymore to continue as it had been operating previously.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I thank you, sir.</p><p>Mr. Walker, some have alleged that Google benefits from illicit websites through advertising revenue.  What do you say in response to that allegation?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  These sites cost us money, sir.  They cost us money to try and get rid of them; they cost us money when we find them and we refund money to advertisers.  They cost us money when they use fake credit cards or stolen credit cards to pay for what they're doing.  We have no interest in having advertising on these sites.  We have no interest in having advertising leading to these sites.</p><p>There are two separate problems here.  One is a problem of the digital piracy, songs and videos which typically are given away for free on the web.  Those sites have no trouble drawing traffic. Everybody wants something for free.  Those sites have a problem with modernization and so they use ad services to try and raise money, and we want to block that.  And in fact, every time you see a Google ad on one of those sites, if they've gotten through our system, there's a way to click on that ad and report that site for having infringing content on.</p><p>There's a separate problem with regard to people selling counterfeit real goods, analog goods, traditional stuff.  Those sites have no problem making money because they're (probably over there ?) making the good for this much and they're selling it for that good -- much.  Their problem is they're trying to drive traffic.  And so on that side, for our systems, that's an ad words problem.</p><p>And so we go through the ads on the Google sites and try to make sure that we don't have ads going to sites that are infringing, like the Louis Vuitton sites that we talked about before.  And when we find it, when we hear about it, we pull them out.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I thank you, sir.  Let me ask you another question, Mr. Walker.  If Google learns that certain websites are illicit or illegal, can it restrict those websites from its searches?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  So we've been talking this over on the advertising side.  The search is more challenging and again, to Mr. Abrams' point, we -- need to be very focused here.</p><p>It is correct that if we have the government come and tell us that a given site is illegal, we can address that, that problem, in our search results.  But we want to do that in a way that is -- obviously has appropriate due process involved and doesn't put us in the position of having to make those evaluations.  Right now, we need to work together with the content industry to do that.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I thank you, sir.</p><p>Ms. Jones, what is your recommendation for the best approach to eliminate these websites in the United States and abroad?  Or do you have a recommendation?</p><p>MS. JONES:  Sure.  I always have a recommendation.  We -- (laughter) -- sorry.  We have had a really good --</p><p>REP. COBLE:   (Word inaudible) --  a good defense.   If you can do it, it ain't braggin'.  (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. JONES:  (Laughs.)  We've had a really -- we've had a really good string of luck with voluntary cooperation from all of the players on the Internet to take action against operators of websites that are engaged in bad actions, whatever their service is.  So I recommend that we, as an industry, do that first and foremost.</p><p>So in other words, if I send to Google the 36,000 domain names that we took down under the Ryan Haight Act in 2010, I think Google ought to disable the search to those sites.  And I think Visa and MasterCard and PayPal and Discover should disable the payment processing.  And I think FedEx and UPS and the United States Postal Service should stop shipping drugs for those companies, and so and so forth.</p><p>However, we know that not everybody cooperates and not everybody's a good guy, so in addition to that, I think we have to have legislation that says if you don't, there's a consequence.  If we give you notice and you take down your services, you're good.  If we give you notice and you fail to respond, you're not good.  That is my recommendation.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Mr. Coble, could I jump in that for just a moment?</p><p>REP. COBLE:  Sure.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  I want to make the point that the real way to go after these guys is to go after these guys and get them off the web. Because if they're out there, just saying they can't be in a search engine or they can't be in Facebook or they can't be on a blog or a link to them can't be there, isn't going to solve the problem. Because people are going to talk about them, and when they talk about the Pirate Bay or something else, those links are going to come back up in any search engine worth its salt.</p><p>So our worry is that we can cut off -- we'd recommend cutting off the money to these guys, cut off the advertising, cut off the financial services.  When you start to go after the pure search side of it, the risk is that you're both overbroad and ultimately ineffective in doing it.</p><p>REP. COBLE:  I see my red light has illuminated.  I yield back. Good to have you all with us this morning.  Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you.  The chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I think this is an excellent hearing and it shows how complicated some of these issues are.  And yet it is important that we deal with the challenges in a way that is serious but also works as a technical matter and also with an eye to our Constitution, not only the First Amendment, but the Fourth Amendment.  We want to make sure that we're effective but smart.</p><p>And along those lines, Mr. Morton, I was interested in -- the Operation In Our Sites effort, how many of the owners of those sites that were the subject of your actions, how many of those owners were arrested?  And for the seizures that have not been followed by an arrest, has ICE attempted to make arrests and if not, why not?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  I'll have to get you the exact numbers, Ms. Lofgren. But the -- a couple of things are going on.  There -- several of these cases are part of an ongoing criminal investigation, so I can't really predict one way or another how they're going to end up.  A few people have arrest -- been arrested, and I can get you those stats.</p><p>But the real challenge, as I alluded to in the beginning, is that in many of these cases, we have a criminal investigation but most of the actors are, for practical purposes, outside of our reach.  They're not in this country.  They're in --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Well, perhaps what I can do off-calendar is just get the stats.  Because I -- you're bringing-- you're going to court, you're bringing a criminal action, you're getting a matter signed by a magistrate, and I want to know then what?  How many criminal prosecutions?  How many arrests?</p><p>And I'm eager -- I understand that somebody is not as -- outside our jurisdiction, that's a more complicated factor, which goes to the other question I have, which has to do with the jurisdiction itself.</p><p>Now, my understanding is that the customs part of ICE, they have jurisdiction over goods that cross international borders.  What is the limit on ICE's authority over the Internet?  Is it the international aspect of it, or is it ICE's position that you have jurisdiction over the Internet itself?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  That is -- that latter proposition is not our position.  Our position is that we have jurisdiction over the relevant federal offenses, provided there is the necessary constitutional nexus to the United States for the Congress to assert jurisdiction.</p><p>So in practical terms, that means there needs to be some element or instrument of the crime occurring here in the United States.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  So the -- it's wrongdoing crossing into the United States, is that -- involving --</p><p>MR. MORTON:  That's right.  Involving the United States or United States right holder, some U.S. interest.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  But there has to be an international component.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  That's right.  If you were engaged in counterfeiting of Indian goods in China and there was no nexus whatsoever to the United States at all, that's not a case we would investigate --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  All right.  Let me ask you this, and it's something that I think people -- obviously we have a need for enforcement, but we also -- and want to make sure that things were done in a proper way.  And recently -- and I don't mean to say, obviously we're not the same -- but Russia used copyright enforcement -- it was -- it was pirated copies of Microsoft software.</p><p>They used those pirated copies as an excuse to go in and take computers and shut down dissident groups -- and there was in fact infringement going on, but they used it really for political reasons. What do we have in place that would prevent the government from that sort of activity here?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Well, I'm not familiar with that particular case, but I think the short answer to your question is that we have a wonderful judicial system in this country.  We have a great sense of the rule of law.  We have a great sense of ethical behavior on the part of government.  I have to go to --</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  No, but -- but -- no, but procedurally.  Right now there's -- there's an ex parte communication.  You go to a magistrate. You say what you think.  There's nobody on the other side saying what they think.  You get, in most cases, the order, you take it down.</p><p>What's -- what's the -- (inaudible) -- on you?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Well, I have to demonstrate that there is probable cause for the seizure to the federal judge, and the day we do it, you can walk into court and challenge that seizure immediately.  And in addition to the separate rights you have to challenge the ultimate forfeiture, if the government pursues a permanent seizure of the site. So there's a tremendous amount of process that is provided for -- upon seizure.</p><p>The seizure itself follows the traditional rules in Rule 41 where we go to a -- a judge, ex parte, and we say we believe a crime is being committed.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  I have about five pages more of questions for you, so Mr. Morton, I will deliver those to you in writing.</p><p>And I wonder, as I listened, especially to the testimony from Go Daddy and Google, I'm reminded that this stuff is more complicated than is -- than is obviously understood, and how useful it might be to have some of the big tech presences engage in more deep conversations with content holders who are understandably concerned about what's happening to them.  And that -- that might yield a -- an effective result that is far superior to what the non-engineers in the Congress might craft.</p><p>So I would just leave that suggestion with the panel.  They don't need the permission of the Congress to do that, but I think that might be a good outcome of this hearing.</p><p>And I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p><person><nameText>REP.

DARRELL ISSA (R-CA):  I thank the chairman.</p><p>I think I'll take the liberty of taking us a little off IP for a moment, since we have the representative of ICE here.  What's the financial threshold for you to care about counterfeiting?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Typically there isn't one.  We're quite aggressive when it comes to intellectual property enforcement.  Obviously the various prosecutors, the United States attorneys' offices we deal with do have at some point some limitations.  There's enough work out there--</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Why don't -- why don't you -- yeah, why don't you give us an idea?  You know, there was a movie back, I think, in the '30s with Cagney, \"Never Steal Anything Small.\"  And it was actually a union organization, but it was -- it was a great one because basically he stole enough to be hero of the union.</p><p>When -- how do we change the system, which Congress has the right to do, so that every single crime that you know is a crime can in fact be pursued in a way that will allow a change of behavior?  Now, I'm not talking about going after the P2P swapper who is changing his own library with somebody down the street.</p><p>But I'm talking about somebody who commercializes the selling of counterfeits.  And I did not say intellectual property; I said counterfeits.  I don't see a difference; I don't think anyone on this panel should see a difference of whether it is tangible and you can feel and touch it or it simply plays through a speaker.</p><p>What would change -- what change in the law would allow you to pursue everyone, for all practical purposes, where today you probably pursue what, one-half, one-quarter, one-tenth of 1 percent?  Certainly you pursue less than 1 percent in the tangible world, don't you?</p><p>If you find -- and I'll get to the question -- if you find -- and I'll take an example from my own life.  You find 500 Viper alarms inside a shipment of -- my former life, if you will -- inside a shipment of clothing.  And it's designated as clothing, and you find it, basically you seize it and that's the end of the story, isn't it?</p><p>So you found tens of thousands of dollars of value.  You found registered trademarks, copies of the images that make the product real, patented product, tangible, and the most you'll do is destroy it.  That is the practical reality today, whether -- and you're shaking your head yes.</p><p>That's the record that I hope we'll make here today, is that we're talking about -- and I appreciate all the people in the IP world.  We're talking about organizations, we're saying you have to do better.  You have to get it down to zero.</p><p>What can we do, in your opinion -- and I'll take from each of you, please -- to get to a zero tolerance?  And I'm not trying to get you to go after fake Viper car alarms or Polk audio or any of the other things from my own past.  But I'll give you a recent one, and I'll give it to you as an anecdotal.</p><p>About a year ago my congressional office ordered a USB thumb drive.  They were tired of me carrying three different thumb drives, so we ordered one of the new 256-gig thumb drives.  We ordered it from one of the major companies not represented here today.  Their vendor was a group which I will give, called Fantastic Deal.  Now, today they're called Good Old Deal and Fantastic Deal.  But if you Google them -- and you will get the actual company selling on that other company.</p><p>So the metadata that they put in to make sure that they still come up under their old name of Fantastic Deal -- and by the way, they're still Fantastic Deal when they tell you that we at Fantastic Deal are committed to your satisfaction; please don't hesitate to contact us.  They flat-shipped a, on its face -- it was 256 gig, but it was not made by Kingston; it was not authentic in any way, shape or form, and they shipped it out.  It is still selling.  They paid no price for it.  The most they had to do was live up to that company's guarantee of letting me cancel the credit card, which I did around them anyway.</p><p>What change from the dais here will allow you to not let those go, because they didn't meet a financial threshold that was in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Let me start, and then -- I'll try to be brief so the rest of the panel can give you're their thoughts as well.</p><p>If -- there -- some of it's a resource issue.  Some of it is -- take ICE, for example, a question of balancing competing enforcement priorities.  Obviously we're going to have to go after the cartel members and child pornographers and other things of weighty importance to the nation.</p><p>I think the big challenges are focusing on the foreign actors who are in the game for the -- you know, as a form of organized crime and have no intention whatsoever of coming to the United States, of basing their operations here.  They are able, sadly in many instances, through the Internet to commit a crime on the United States on a grand scale, on a repeated scale, from afar.</p><p>And so we need, I think, a balance of authorities.  Criminal authorities will never get us all there --civil authorities address that; aggressive seizure, penalties for where we can bring U.S. enforcement action.  International cooperation is critical.</p><p>You could give ICE triple the number of agents it has.  We have no authority to arrest people in China.  We have no authority to -- (inaudible).</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p>REP. ISSA:  I appreciate that, although all the examples I gave had a U.S. nexus.  Could you -- the rest of you weigh in, please?</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  I agree with Mr. Morton.  I think all we can do, but it's important, is to do everything we can to drain actions of this sort of the profits that have been building up over the years and increasing, indeed, more and more as time passes.  Because I agree that the criminal law is not going to work very easily or comfortably when you deal with foreign actors that never come here.</p><p>So we're going to have to work, I think in the main, through changes in our civil legislation to take all the steps that we can to make it impossible or at least very difficult for these entities to continue to engage in the criminal -- and it is criminal -- activity that they're currently engaged in.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Mr. Walker?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  I'd have three thoughts, building on the comments here.  First, go after the bad guys directly, whether that's more resources for ICE or otherwise.  Second, it is an international problem.  Right now, the MLAP process, that Multilateral Legal Assistance Treaty process, is broken.  It can take months, sometimes up to six months, for an international law enforcement to cooperate with each other in going after these guys.  That doesn't work for them and it doesn't work for us in trying to stop it.</p><p>And then lastly, I agree again, follow the money.  If we can cut off the funding sources and identify the bad guys and then cut off advertising on their sites, that'll be powerful.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Ms. Jones?</p><p>MS. JONES:  Thank you, sir.  I would second the comments of my panel -- fellow panel members, but also from the dais, what you can do to be helpful to us, to answer your question, is give us cover so that if we take action against these people, we have a safe harbor.  We don't have people suing us, we're not going to jail.  We want to help you, but you have to help us help you.</p><p>REP. ISSA:  Thank you for the best of all answers.</p><p>I yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you.  I just want to -- (word inaudible) -- as we have been called for a vote, but the chair recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Chu, for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE JUDY CHU (D-CA):  Well, thank you, Mr. Chair, for convening this important hearing.  And as you know, this issue of online piracy is of great concern to my Los Angeles district, given the importance of the motion picture and recording industry to the city and the many residents who are employed by them.  So I hope that we can all work together to come up with a solution that gives law enforcement a real tool to stop this practice.</p><p>And while the Combatting Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act that was introduced in the Senate last year is a great start, I am concerned that it doesn't address the problem of cyber lockers that are flooded with infringing content.</p><p>It's important that we don't hurt legitimate business interests, but these businesses that reward these customers for uploading infringing content and refuse to penalize the offenders are not legitimate business interests.  So I hope that we can address these infringing websites and cyber lockers.</p><p>I also want to thank Mr. Morton for joining us today and for all the great work that he's done on the Operation In Our Sites.</p><p>And let me just start then by asking Mr. Walker, I am very concerned of course, as you heard about the infringement facilitated by the cyber lockers, but I don't want to affect legitimate developments in cloud computing.</p><p>How can Congress help law enforcement go after the bad actors in the cyber locker space without inferring with -- interfering with legitimate economic interests?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  It's the right balance to draw, Congresswoman.  The challenge with cyber lockers, which are really just a different way of describing storing content online, is a real one.  Because as you can tell, the entire direction of the industry is in favor of moving toward the cloud, allowing people across the country, across the world, to access music, video, content, documents, email in much more flexible ways that they were able to even a dozen years ago.</p><p>That's a great thing for consumers and then, we think, ultimately a great thing for the content industries and -- if it provides more platforms and more ways that people can consume content, lawfully and legitimately.  iTunes is, in a sense, a version of the cyber locker that allows you to download information from the cloud.  We've seen other significant companies launch ways of offering online storage.</p><p>When you get into the question of the legitimacy of the business or not, it really goes to the question of an intent to induce an infringement.  And the existing copyright laws have been used in some cases to go after companies that clearly, again, are sort of dedicated to just having illegal content ousted and promoting that kind of activity, distinguished from legitimate companies who may have broadbase multipurpose storage that is abused by some of their users. That does raise more difficult -- (inaudible) -- the question.</p><p>REP. CHU:  How about you, Ms. Jones?  I understand that Go Daddy also provides remote storage services.  How can we ensure that law enforcement has all the tools that it needs to go after cyber lockers that intentionally promote the sharing of infringing content, without impeding legitimate businesses?</p><p>MS. JONES:  We are a very large provider of cloud-based services, and it's difficult for us to go, say, scan all of the files that are stored on our online file folder products.  But what we can do is limit storage, limit bandwidth usage and know patterns of behavior so that if there are very, very, very large quantities of data and they all seem to be copies of movies, our system might pick that kind of thing up.</p><p>But short of that, it's really important to us to have information from the content providers so if it's the song makers, the movie makers, the video producers, whatever those people are, to help us be helpful.  And also so that it helps law enforcement to know which ones to go after, because it's not enough for me to just say customer A has 47 dedicated servers and they're all filled with video stuff, it's not good enough.  Because I don't know if it's legitimate content or not.  That guy could have bought 47 dedicated servers' worth of videos.</p><p>So it's really important for us to be able to identify -- and I think Mr. Walker has pointed this out as well -- what is legitimate content and what's not, so that we can -- again, we don't want to be facilitating bad guys, but we need -- we need help to identify which ones they are.</p><p>REP. CHU:  Thank you.  And Mr. Morton, what are the next steps in Operation In Our Sites?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Well, we're going to continue to work with industry. We've been very careful not to focus on any one industry over the other.  As you know, sadly, the whole landscape of American industry is under assault right now, so we'll focus on pharmaceutical sites, we'll focus on entertainment sites.  In -- the counterfeiting sites we can do all day long, sadly, there are so many of them.</p><p>And we're just going to keep at it.  Wherever we can we're going to pursue a full criminal investigation for those sites where all of the elements of the crime other than the domain name are outside of the United States, we'll focus on the domain names and take them down as aggressively as we can, recognizing we are -- that's not the long- term solution.  It's one part of trying to combat this problem.</p><p>But we've got to do something.  My perspective is do nothing, and you fail.  And so we've tried very hard to get out there to do something and work with the other parts of the system to get us to a better, more comprehensive solution.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN:  Thank you.  I yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Thank you very much.  As previously noted, we have a vote, so this hearing shall be temporarily adjourned until immediately following the vote.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Recessed.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Recessed.  Thank you, Mr. Watt.  (Laughter.)</p><p>(Recess.)</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  The committee will reconvene.  And before I turn to the gentleman from California, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter in the record two letters, one from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children dated March 30, 2011, addressed to Chairman Smith and pertinent to the issue raised by the gentlewoman from California.  And another, a letter to the members of the United States Congress from a coalition of groups dated March 30, 2011, and on a related subject.</p><p>And at this time it's my pleasure to recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Berman, for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE HOWARD BERMAN (D-CA):  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  And thank all of you for your testimony.  And Mr. Morton, I want to join with others in raising I think some very effective initiatives you're undertaking to deal with the problem we're discussing today.</p><p>Mr. Walker, I appreciate your testimony and your comments about the Digital Millennium Copyright.  I'm sure the chairman of the subcommittee does.  He's spent a great deal of time negotiating that legislation, and a lot of us were involved in it.</p><p>But if -- if that legislation were really working, I don't think we'd be having this hearing.  I don't think there'd be a Senate bill. I don't think customs would be undertaking the initiatives it is undertaking.</p><p>Ms. Lofgren is right.  This is a complicated subject, but there's one element that's quite simple, and that is that truly billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are being lost because of digital theft. And I think we're focused on trying to do something about it.</p><p>But I wanted to take off on -- in terms of a legislative approach, I wanted to take off on what you said.  You said that Google doesn't want to be the judge, jury and executioner.  But right now, under the Digital Millennium Copyright, you are the judge, jury and executioner.  You don't just take down anything that you're asked to take down; you go and try and go through some process to determine if it's a valid request, if in fact it's directed at infringing material.</p><p>The legislative approach is an approach, (truncated ?) process where a judge is the judge and all you have to do is be the executioner.  And I'm wondering if, in that sense, it doesn't -- this might be something you'd be more enthusiastic about because it puts the onus of looking at the whole site and whether it is -- I mean, nothing's going to be 100 percent infringing, because some things will be in the public domain that could be on that site.  But fundamentally, it is a site that is marketing illegally placed content -- content without permission of the copyright owner.</p><p>There was -- so I guess I would like your thoughts -- I'll ask a few questions and you could answer them.  One is I would like your thoughts on whether having a judge rule that a site itself is dedicated to infringement and blocking that site may be a far more effective way of assuring due process while actually making a difference.</p><p>And also your reaction to the notion that the DMCA, as good as it is, in the context of today's technology, yeah, you get that takedown letter.  You try to do it expeditiously, although there is testimony submitted for the record which say it frequently takes as much as 24 -- 20 days for you -- or maybe that's an average of time before it actually, the link comes down.  And I believe Google has said they're going to try and do this within 24 hours.</p><p>But I do notice that the searches and the algorithms take a few seconds, so -- and when you're talking about a newly released film or music, 24 hours on a site is disaster in terms of millions of people who can then get it for free.  But your notion of why this -- a judge doing this isn't more effective than putting all the onus on you.</p><p>And correct me if I'm wrong, but when you get such a letter, you take down the link to that site.  I don't even know if you have the legal ability or the -- not the functional ability to take down that site as a site.  So all you're doing is taking out a link to one of what could be thousands of different works that are on that site.  It is -- it's a little bit like trying to empty the ocean with a bucket, and I'd like to get your reaction to some of those things.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  There were a lot of comments there, so let me try and address them all and if I miss one, please let me know.</p><p>I would say our fundamental position is that we agree that there's a way to complement the DMCA.  The DMCA has been very effective for what it's done, but there are ways, additional measures that can be taken to go after the money, to go after some of the advertising, to after the payment processors that may reach some things that are outside the copyright domain -- counterfeiting and the like.  And we've indicated we're happy to work with the subcommittee on that.</p><p>It is -- there is a balance, obviously, because there are millions of dollars, billions of dollars, on each side of the table. I mean, Google's accounts were $54 billion in economic activity in the United States --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Yeah, but that's -- that -- you know, but I mean that's important, and innovation is important.  But to the extent that some portion of that billions of dollars is coming from giving people access to copyrighted works that they didn't have their permission to use, it's the fruits of poisonous trees.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  We understand that and we don't want money from illegal purposes, from illegal services, and never have.  But, you know, most of it, the vast majority, is going to small businesses, small publishers, advertisers whose businesses actually exist because the Internet is out there.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Sure.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  So we're trying to, again, separate the wheat from the chaff and do it in the most effective way we can.  The DMCA has been a good model for what it's done.  That notice and takedown has been very robust and it's been adopted -- the work of this committee and Congress -- has been adopted around the world, in Europe and elsewhere.  So we want to be careful about doing something that would undercut that.  But that's not to say we're opposed to additional sort of targeted measures that go after things.</p><p>To your comments and Ms. Lofgren's comments earlier, we are in fairly frequent conversations with the general counsels and representatives of the trade associations of the major motion picture studios, the RIAA, et cetera, to try and refine and improve and streamline our processes.</p><p>It's -- in many cases, it is challenging.  It does take a long time, and we're hoping to make it a much shorter time, to go back and forth through the different DMCA notices we get.  There are a lot of people out there who don't understand copyright law or are using them for abusive purposes to try and take down competitor sites without a legitimate legal claim, and we need to sort through those.</p><p>But I think we can do it, especially with regard to some of the online tools that we're soon to be launching, in a much faster way than we're doing now.</p><p>You had asked also with regard to the question of -- there's one question about pre-release movies.  We've actually talked to the studios about that and are there ways of being able to address that in an even more expedited fashion, where there's real economic injury being -- at issue there.</p><p>And then lastly I would say we do have -- focusing in on your question with regard to whether or not a court finding would be useful in this.  Before we, you know, before anyone takes significant steps of taking away a domain name or cutting off advertising to a site, I think it is appropriate for a court to weigh in with appropriate due process to review that.</p><p>And the model of doing that in a way that's targeted on the truly bad sites -- and I think, you know, for some reasons we've talked with the staff on the Senate side with regard to the bill that was introduced in the last session, in some ways that definition was somewhat overbroad and created some of the free expression and due process issues we've talked about.</p><p>But we're optimistic that we can work together to get to a more focused definition.  And we would be prepared to support that.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Mr. Chairman, I know my time is quite expired. It's just -- could I squeeze one more in here, though?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Without objection.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  In your testimony you say the DMCA has practical and real effect in thwarting infringement.  Legislation that targets the worst of the worst should not increase liability for online services that are playing by the rules.</p><p>What if we maintained the level of liability, not increase the liability, but required more affirmative steps be undertaken under that standard of liability?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Well, I think much of that proposal, again, on the Senate side, would have required affirmative steps, based on a finding that a given site was dedicated to illegal content.  By having us remove it from our search results, and we are willing --</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  But that doesn't increase your liability.  That -- the --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  No, this would affect -- I think generally not.  Ms. Jones has raised concerns about, you know, needing to have a safe harbor on that side.  But generally speaking, we've been able to terminate people for violating our policies without getting suits back from the bad guys in response.</p><p>Our focus has been mostly on the collateral consequences of undermining the DMCA.  For example, if a site is adjudged to be bad and that URL is out there, and then somebody using our services posts it, posts that URL in a Google doc or in an email -- I send you an email; it includes that URL.  Well, Google is now posting that content, in a sense.  Are we liable for including that URL?  I think the common-sense answer is no, we shouldn't be, and that the DMCA insulates that from liability.</p><p>But if just that sort of in rem order would deem to be de facto red-flag knowledge, there'd at least be an open question.  So we need to clarify those kinds of unintended consequences.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  (Off mic.)</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutch, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TED DEUTCH (D-FL):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Director Morton, you and I have spoken many times about the recent ICE seizures of rogue websites, and I've been very open about my admiration for the way that your office took on the absolute worst of the worst of these websites hosting illegal content.  And I'd just like to say publicly again that more agencies, I think, ought to take a look at the -- at their existing authorities and find new ways to use those clear and established powers to combat recognized problems. And I hope that others will learn from your excellent example.</p><p>Mr. Walker, I just -- I wanted to follow up on two online points, and then shift slightly.  You had spoken earlier about autocomplete, and the fact that autocomplete really reflects what people are searching for.  And that's how it -- it's actually -- that's how it actually works.</p><p>Are there any terms, are there any -- is there anything that you can do to change that if -- in other words, or for example, drugs, pornography, is there any way that you ever modify autocomplete so that it doesn't come up with -- it doesn't show the list of search terms that might actually be a popular search term?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  There are in the pornography realm, for example, terms that are facially offensive to virtually every user of the site that are blocked, yes.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  So it's possible.  It's not simply the will of the masses that will dictate what autocomplete shows.  It is possible to actually --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  No, absolutely.  And we've already said that we are doing that in this context as well.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  And then one other follow-up on the issue of searches and the efforts that you've taken to -- the efforts that you've taken on specific websites and specific searches where it's clear that they lead to pirated material, stolen material.</p><p>Do you -- in addition to those terms, do you also include specific websites that are provided to you?  I mean, a lot of times people who search the web, who go on Google, are fairly sophisticated. They don't -- they know what they're looking for.  They don't need to search free movies or free music.  They know the site that they heard about in their high school class.  That's what they go to search for.</p><p>So have you taken steps, and can you take steps to stop, so when someone starts typing in whatever that violating website is, that that website name won't come up as well?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yes, and that's consistent with the effort we've announced, and we're working with the content industries to try and focus on that.</p><p>REP. BERMAN:  Great.  And so I'd like to just shift then and move on to what is -- really, where the world is going, and that's apps. And there was a conversation earlier, exchange that you had where there was some discussion of this Grooveshark app that was removed from your marketplace.</p><p>I just wanted to pursue that a little bit further.  That was ultimately taken down.  When were you -- when were you first made aware of that, that that site was available, that app was available in your marketplace?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  I'm not sure, Congressman.  We can get back to you. I will tell you that it the apps marketplace has probably been in existence for a little bit more than a year.  During that period of time we have removed something on the order of 2,000 different applications, for a variety of reasons, including intellectual property infringement.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  OK.  Because when I -- I used, played around on one of my staff members' Google phones, and went to the apps store.  And still when you type in \"free,\" the autocomplete on the phone will finish and you can find free music.  And if you go to the free market within this -- you can go to free music within the marketplace, and you can still find what appears to be, to me, to be hundreds of sites that deal in stolen music, stolen movies as well, perhaps stolen books; I'm -- I couldn't quite tell.  That wasn't as easily identifiable.</p><p>So if you could speak to the efforts being made to crack down, there is one example, this one app that you took down, but what steps are taken?  What do you do to actually take them down?  And if I can suggest, when you're on -- when you're in the store there is an opportunity for you to flag as inappropriate the app that comes up.</p><p>And I would respectfully suggest that in addition to the idea, as to the reasons that you list already -- sexual content, graphic violence, hateful or abusive content and other objections, that it might be helpful for those of us who are concerned about these issues and who monitor this to include a specific check-off box for stolen content, pirated content, whatever you think is most helpful.  I think that might help you investigate.  But if you could speak a little bit about the steps that you do take.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  It's a helpful suggestion, Congressman, and we are across our products trying to have a more standardized approach to web forms that allow people to report all of the kinds of content that we're talking about here today and create queues for review and processing that in an expeditious way.</p><p>We do have a team of people who review the apps in the apps store.  It is -- it is sometimes challenging because there's -- any number of people have an incentive to get their apps in there.  In some cases those apps are a camouflage and difficult to determine.</p><p>There are legitimate apps that will allow you to buy, you know -- or obtain free content, and there's a lot of legitimate free content out on the web.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  Right.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  And so we're trying to distinguish the apps that are, you know, well intentioned from the apps that are potentially inducing -- designed to induce infringement.  And that's the approach that we've taken there and continue to take as we review these, as well as apps that are trying to get malware out and various other sort of negative content.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  OK.  And again, I -- what I'm concerned about is your marketplace, and if you could actually help me understand this a little better, your marketplace functions essentially as an online mall.  And stores open in this mall and they don't -- in a traditional bricks-and-mortar mall, those stores would pay rent.</p><p>Can you explain how Google is compensated by these apps that pop up in the marketplace?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  It varies, which is perhaps one of the reasons why it's not as clear as it could be.  Many apps are free. That is, there's not compensation per se.  Some of those are supported by advertisements; some of them are not.  And then some of them you actually pay for the app and in that case, Google takes a small amount of money as a fee for its service in providing the platform.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  On the free apps, the ones that are free to the consumer, are there -- is there any other way that Google is compensated for those?  Are there advertisements that -- (inaudible) --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah, they may choose these advertisements or they may not.  And they may use Google ads or other forms of ads.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  And so again, my -- and I hope that you can understand my concern here -- in a traditional shopping center, there would be no place or any store that opens that sells illegal goods. In this case, Mr. Morton and his good folks are effectively playing the role that the sheriffs in Palm Beach County would play if a shopping center opened in my district that wanted to sell illegal merchandise.  And those stores would immediately be shut down as soon as they were notified.</p><p>Just trying to bring this full circle, I would -- I would ask that you can provide the committee with some details on the Grooveshark example, since it's been touted as a great example of your efforts to try to crack down on these apps that merchandise in illegal goods.  I'd like to understand when you were first notified and how long the investigation -- how long it took to investigate.</p><p>If you -- if there's any way for you to determine how many songs might have been downloaded illegally during the period of that investigation, that's -- that would all be most helpful, I think, as we go about this.</p><p>And finally, Mr. Chair, if I could also ask, I know you had -- you're going to be requesting some additional information as well.  I hope that you can -- you can broaden your request to focus on the application world as well, given that this is really the direction that we're going.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Yes, if the gentleman would yield.  If the gentleman would work with the committee staff, we'll be happy to incorporate your question into the questions that we'll submit to the members of the panel.</p><p>REP. DEUTCH:  I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman, and I'll yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentleman.</p><p>The gentlewoman from Florida, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Watt, who I know is not here at the moment, I really want to thank you, start out by thanking you for holding this hearing today, and for officially opening this investigation into rogue websites  here in the House.</p><p>As our economy continues to recover, we really must take every action that we can to create jobs and meaningfully address intellectual property theft is -- a great place to start.  And that's why I've been having a conversation with Google about this for almost three years now.  And Mr. Walker, it's good to see you.</p><p>In the last hearing, Mr. Chairman, I focused on the problem of advertising on rogue sites -- advertising which not only lines the pockets of those who facilitate theft, but also advertising that makes many of these rogue sites seem legitimate to unwitting users.</p><p>And today, Mr. Walker, I'd like to talk with you about two related issues, as you have spent the morning doing, talking about your autocomplete feature on search, and your notice and takedown times under the DMCA.  And first I want to start with autocomplete.</p><p>In your testimony, you say that Google is committed to prevent terms that are closely related with piracy from appearing in autocomplete.  And you go on to say that you're working with the industry stakeholders to suggest specific terms that shouldn't appear in autocomplete.</p><p>And you were kind enough to come see me in my office almost a month ago, March 10th, and I raised this issue with you then, so I know you won't be sandbagged by my raising it here now.  I showed you -- let me just grab it -- this screen shot and it was a screen shot that lists what comes up in a search when you type in the word \"knockoff.\"  Now then, Google's algorithm automatically filled in, suggested that -- suggested search terms that I described, some of which, like Uggs and Coach, were the names of a specific brand.</p><p>I showed you this screen shot which showed all the suggested autofills when I typed in the word \"knockoff\" into the search engine window.  It showed knockoff handbags, knockoff Uggs, knockoff Coach handbags, knockoff shoes, knockoff watches and knockoff sunglasses, among others.  Now, all I typed in was \"knockoff.\"  I didn't type in anything else, and that's the list that came up.  These weren't words that I typed.  It's what your autofill automatically filled in.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to admit this screen shot into the record.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Without objection.</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  And then we searched the word \"fake\" and got similar results -- fake Rolexes and fake Louis Vuitton purses. Now, I realize in some of our conversation, you know, \"fake\" can be attached to a lot of different kinds of things.</p><p>As we discussed in my office, \"knockoff\" doesn't really conjure up anything other than trying to steal something that is someone else's intellectual property.  And I know you referenced that they sell knockoff dresses and other kinds of products in Nordstrom's and Macy's.  It would be very simple to simply have your autofill put those search terms in after \"knockoff,\" if that's really what someone is searching for.  But instead, your autofill brings up things that are not appropriate and are, in fact, facilitating illegal content and illegal products.</p><p>Now, I had my staff perform -- this was a month ago that we had this conversation.  I had my staff perform the same test yesterday, and they got the same results as they did before I shared these concerns with you a month ago.  So nothing's changed since we talked.</p><p>And I'm concerned that your autocomplete feature continues to suggest that people visit websites with pirated content, that Google enables and facilitates theft by suggesting words that people haven't even typed in yet.</p><p>And I want to suggest to you, Mr. Walker, that the word \"knockoff,\" as I just said, is probably a word you don't need to get consensus on from the nation's designers of purses, handbags, watches, shoes and furry boots.  It is probably OK to eliminate those words after the word \"knockoff.\"</p><p>What other meaning is there for the word \"knockoff\" than a fake product that's meant to be passed off as the real thing?  Couldn't you instead redirect that traffic to legitimate sites?</p><p>Now, Chairman Goodlatte brought up Taylor Swift earlier.  Way back in 2008, Mr. Walker, I sat down with several of your colleages -- several of them are here today -- and way back then I showed them screenshots of unauthorized Hannah Montana songs on Google-hosted blogger sites with Google's ads on them, on top of that.  We talked about Google's obligations under the DMCA and we asked for you to help rightsholders by designing a product that would help them identify infringing content and pull it down more quickly.  You said you'd try to work with us.  But that was three years ago.</p><p>I continued to hear from the rights community that it was taking too long for Google to pull down pirated content.  So a year later, in November, 2009, I facilitated a meeting between your lobbyists and RIAA president Cary Sherman.  In that meeting, Google said you would try again to develop a product cooperatively.  That was two years ago. Again, no real impact.</p><p>In May 2010, Google sent -- (name inaudible) -- to meet with my staff, and I was so excited by what I believed was finally a new attitude at Google that I actually drafted a letter commending you for your leadership and your willingness to address these issues.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, if I can ask that -- well, is there a chairman?  If I can ask unanimous consent to admit this into the record.  Sorry.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Yes, Virginia, there is a chairman.  (Laughter.)</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  (Laughs.)  Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  And without objection, so ordered.</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you.  And I realize that I -- my time's run out.  If I can ask unanimous consent for just a couple of extra minutes, Mr. Chairman, I'm wrapping up.</p><p>That was a year ago.  But I've learned since then that there still has been very little improvement on notice and takedown time. According to the IFPI, for the month of February, 2011, the latest month for which they have records, 46 percent of the blogs (sought ?) infringement notices sent to Google remained active for longer than seven days.</p><p>So Mr. Chairman, would it be possible to include notice and takedown times as part of your investigation?  Chairman Goodlatte?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Yes, the answer's yes.</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  That would be great.</p><p>Mr. Walker, you really have an obligation to take those down within 24 hours.  You know that you do.  We've discussed it.  But for Blogger in February, almost half were still up after a week.  There really isn't a question here, Mr. Walker.  You're Google.  You helped overthrow the head of an entire country in a weekend.  Just -- I mean, really, you're Google.  Okay?  So really, to suggest that this is difficult, is too difficult for Google to accomplish, it seems to me that it's more expression of a lack of will.  And I think that's unacceptable, and I know that you -- you say your heart's in it. Prove to us that you can -- that you want to go beyond the boundaries that the law require you to do, because that's the right thing to do.</p><p>Short of that, you are essentially promoting trafficking of stolen property, and that's just unacceptable.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN(?):  Would the gentlelady yield?</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Oh, I'd be happy to yield.</p><p>REP. LOFGREN(?):  As you were talking, I just went on my little Android and typed in \"knockoff Coach purses,\" for example, on Google search.  The first one, if you go to it, is a site from ICE saying it's been taken down.  The second one, if you go to, site is not found, and the third one is \"How to spot a fake Coach bag.\"</p><p>So I think we can -- we can get overwrought here.  The world wide web is a great big place, and we need to take -- make efforts to get these counterfeit goods taken down.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  The --</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Reclaiming my time, which I don't really have anymore --</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  The gentlewoman's time has expired, and I think it would be only fair to allow the gentleman -- Mr. Walker to respond to both comments.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  Mr. Walker is recognized to respond, and then we'll move on to the next member.</p><p>MR. WALKER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I'll -- and I'll look forward to addressing both of those points, thank you.  And congratulations, Congresswoman, on your appointment yesterday.</p><p>The -- let me do it in reverse order, if I can, because the most important to me -- thing to me and to us is that you do believe and recognize that we are actually making progress here.  Over the last six months or so we have announced commitments to this 24-hour turnaround time.  It's about to be unveiled in the next week or too. We actually have it up and running now in a test mode, and that goes to both copyright and the counterfeiting materials that we've talked about.  That's a dramatic change in streamlining with the -- sort of the key tools that we've been able to implement.  There's an engineering work there and there's also a partnering work there with the key companies we're working with.</p><p>Beyond that, in the last month or so we have unveiled a web tool, a web form that goes across many of our products.  Because one of the problems that we were having was that we were getting so many low- quality notices from people who didn't understand copyright, in some cases things were abusive, in some cases -- meaning one competitor was taking down another competitor's materials, fans of one football team were trying to take down the websites or links on another football team's listings using the DMCA.  These are the kinds of things we need to sort out.</p><p>The web tool replaces a lot of the old, you know, paper and faxes and emails we were getting with a more standardized process.  And as a result, of that -- the good news is it's much easier for rightsowners to be able to file material.  The bad news is we've had a blip in terms of being able to respond as quickly as we'd like to, but we're looking forward to getting those response times down as we go forward. And that's above and beyond the 24-hour commitments we've talked about with the express tools.</p><p>So I think we are seeing progress.  I recognize it's been a continuing conversation with you and your office.  And, you know, judging as we're going forward, I think we're making real and material progress.</p><p>And to Congresswoman Wasserman's earlier comment, we spend a lot of time working with the context industry on this.  I've talked to most of the general counsels of most of the MPAA and RIAA and their trade associations.  We understand where we're coming from.  We are trying to -- while there may always be some difference with regard to scope of fair use and these sorts of issues, there's no reason for grit in the system to be slowing down the operation of the DMCA.  And we're trying to really make sure it's an efficient tool for everybody.</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Mr. Chairman, I realize I'm yielding back time I don't have, but I do appreciate your willingness and expression that there is will.  And I will just point out that, when I did type in \"knock off,\" it was simply \"knock off,\" and those other words came up in your auto-fill --</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  This discussion is going to go on for quite a while.</p><p>REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you very much.  I yield back the time I don't have.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I've been very generous and now will recognize the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Sanchez.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I want to begin by thanking Mr. Morton for the initiative that you've shown in being proactive in going after infringers.  And I do have some questions for you that I'll come back to you.</p><p>But I want to start with Mr. Walker.  And Mr. Walker, I want to address your ad sense program, if I may.  In your written testimony, you stated that you response swiftly when notified by rightsholders that an ad is being placed on an infringing site.  And I'm just curious to know, on average, how long does it take Google to comply with a DMCA notice?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  It varies dramatically, Congresswoman, based on the different products and the different nature of the request.  You have requests in foreign languages.  We have papers that are incomplete, et cetera.</p><p>Our gold standard right now is YouTube where we are typically able to process DMCA requests in a matter of minutes, and we have a very sophisticated system.  That's above and beyond the content ID system that we've already talked about that automates the process for rightsholders.</p><p>With regard to other products, our goal is to move that to within 24 hours where people are able to use our sort of advanced and sophisticated tools.  There will always be some cases that take longer, in some cases days, as we go back and forth with the rightsholders to clarify or correct effective DMCA notices -- DMCA notices that aren't really about copyright, for example, and the like.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  So there really isn't a typical time that you say, a ballpark figure that it takes?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Unfortunately, it's very different for different products.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  Let's start this way then.  What is the shortest length of time it takes Google to respond?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  I would say, as the YouTube example, a matter of minutes.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  And the longest amount of time?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Well, some notices are --</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  I'm just trying to get a scope here of time.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  I don't mean to be evasive.  Many notices are actually never processed because they're incorrect.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  But for correct notices.  Let's qualify that and say for correct notices, what's the longest amount of time it takes?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  You know, I think it's -- it's certainly in days and might even be in weeks depending on the nature of the notice.  Right? Again, if it's in a foreign language, if it's submitted in a way that's difficult for us to process or we have questions.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  All right.</p><p>Let's leave that topic and let me ask you what happens to the ad revenue that was generated by that site while it was hosting infringing material?  Does the ad revenue go to the rightsholder?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yeah.  We find -- there are different scenarios with regard to our ad sense product, which is a product that puts ads up against publisher websites and our ad words products which are ads on Google, essentially, or hosted ads that go out.</p><p>But when we discover somebody who's infringing, we stop payments to them if they're on the publisher side of it, and we refund money to the advertisers if money has been paid out.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  But none of that money goes to the rightsholder who's being infringed upon?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  It's, in many cases, difficult for us to determine who the rightsholders is in some of these situations.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  If it's a piece of music, as you know, there are labels and publishers and artists.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  Sure.  So somebody is making money off of these sites, but it's almost like the rightsholder is sort of a double whammy.  They're being infringed upon by somebody else who's using their content in a way that isn't authorized, and then somebody who's selling ad revenue then on those sites is also making money and not -- and that's not going to the rightful --</p><p>MR. WALKER:  But I want to be clear.  We're not making money, really, because we're refunding the money back to the advertiser when we discover that the site that the ad was appearing on was infringing. So it's not as though Google is holding that money.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  OK.  Well, you and I will have to disagree on whether or not there's profit to be made in advertising on infringing sites.</p><p>I want to go back to Mr. Morton and your public education efforts.  Now, you mentioned a successful symposium that you had last year, and you talked about one that is also planned for this year.</p><p>And the question that I have for you -- and I'm not trying to be impertinent here -- is seems like symposiums, which are a great idea, sort of -- it's sort of like preaching to the converted because the folks that are attending those symposiums are probably the most informed or at least the most aware of the problem of IP theft -- and I'm talking specifically about industry leaders, government officials and congressional staff -- and reinforcing information to those folks may, you know, may be beneficial.</p><p>But if we're talking about the vast scope of IP theft, I would think that probably education efforts are probably, you know, better aimed towards a younger audience and the people who are actually doing the infringing.  So I want to know if you're taking any steps to inform, say, you know, teenage kids who are looking for the new album of their favorite artist or a college student who's looking to, you know, watch a movie online or, you know, that type of crowd.</p><p>You know, are there any efforts that you're dedicating towards making them more aware of the issue?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  It's an excellent question.  The government has not typically been expert in the public education arena in this area, but it's exactly where we need to be.  So one of the things that we've been thinking about is the seizure banners that we use, right now, are static.  And they just say -- (inaudible) -- this site.</p><p>One of the things we've been contemplating is when we actually forfeit a site that was dedicated to infringing or counterfeiting, can we use the fact that so many people are going to see our banners.  I mean, they've become a sort of unanticipated Internet phenomenon.  Can we use those as an educational opportunity and, instead of them just being static, have a public-service announcement?</p><p>The other thing that we need to do and work on is working with the rightsholders so that we have -- let's take the entertainment industry -- updated public-service announcements in the movie or maybe it's on, you know, iTunes or using the platforms that already exist that people are going to that are legitimate to help preach the gospel, as it were.</p><p>And so we're very much focused on that.  It is a need.  It's a work in progress.</p><p>REP. SANCHEZ:  Great.  Thank you.  And I thank the chairman, and I yield back.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentlewoman.</p><p>The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And to our ranking member and all of the members of this committee, this is a fascinating discussion and one that's very much needed.  And I'm really appreciative for the opportunity to engage our folks who have come here today to help us to learn about this problem of rogue sites and infringers, et cetera.</p><p>And while I thank everyone, I'm particularly drawn to Ms. Jones -- Ms. Christine Jones, the Go Daddy Group -- who is so confident about what she's attempting to do and your description of the volunteer efforts that you are attempting to get everyone involved in.</p><p>I notice in your testimony, you talked about -- I think you said you had identified 36,000 infringers or websites and that you told Google about them and you expected them to take them down.  Is that what you meant?  Or did you mean something else that you didn't have time to discuss about what you expected of Google?  Would you elaborate a bit on that?</p><p>MS. JONES:  Sure.  In 2010, we disabled 36,000 websites that were engaged in selling drugs illegally online.  We worked together with the intellectual property enforcement coordinator from the White House and Google, who has co-led this effort with me the entire way, to form a group that would address those sorts of things.</p><p>So if I had suggested that I gave them a list that they did not act on, I misspoke, and let's correct the record on that.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  OK.</p><p>MS. JONES:  What I'm saying is that is exactly the sort of thing that voluntary cooperative group is designed to address, and I think it can be done effectively and successfully in other contexts as well.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Is there some way that we could be helpful in incentivizing everyone so that there is more cooperation and that, you know, people are looking out for each other?  Is there something that we can do legislatively?</p><p>MS. JONES:  Well, one of the things that we've heard from some of our brethren in the industry is that, look, we're not as big as Google, and we're not as big as Go Daddy; you guys have scale, you have resources to effort against these problems; we don't.  Some registrars have 10 employees in the entire company.  Right?  We have thousands.</p><p>So one of the things that they have specifically asked for -- and I think I can speak on their behalf here -- is help them know when a site is engaged in illicit activity.  Don't leave it to them to decide.  And, frankly, we'd like to have that, too.  It's just that we might have some experts on our staff who have some knowledge and some judgment.</p><p>So I think help them know.  Don't threaten with them a lawsuit if they take action against a website.  Give them a safe harbor if they do what they're supposed to do, and then provide a consequence for the people that refuse to do it.</p><p>I mean, I think we have to keep in mind here we're vilifying Google because they're big and they have the ability to influence a whole lot of what happens on the Internet.</p><p>And some people vilify us because we're big, and we have the most domain names under management of anybody in the whole world.  But we don't engage in infringing other people's intellectual property. Right?</p><p>So I think you have to be a little careful about throwing the spears against the people who are trying to make it better.  And that's my one single defense of Mr. Walker today.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  And, for the record, Mr. Chairman, I don't feel particularly vilified here.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Well, let me turn to Mr. Walker.  I'm glad you don't feel that you've been vilified.  Perhaps you don't know it when you see it.  (Laughter.)</p><p>But I'd like to know what do you think you can do better.  You obviously have identified ways that you've tried and the complications of that.  What else can you do?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  I think we can continue to work with the content industry to make the process faster.  And we have a common goal on that.  And we're in the late stages of actually being able to deliver in a big way on that.  And that's been an issue that we announced in December and has been universally applauded, I think, by the folks on that side of the aisle.</p><p>And we also -- as we've said, we are open to working on the advertising side, which is really the right complement to the DMCA process, to try and cut off advertisements that court to sites the courts have adjudicated to be illegal essentially and dedicated to infringing content.  That makes sense to us as a complement.</p><p>We're also doing a lot of things to try and make life easier for rightsholders.  We have hundreds of people working on this problem now.  We spent, as I told you, tens of millions of dollars to try and address it in a better way.  We're trying to take the friction out of the system, and there are a lot of ways of doing that.  Having a simplified web form is one.  Faster turnaround time is another. Working on the advertising system is a third.</p><p>REP. WATERS:  Thank you.  I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  I thank the gentlewoman.</p><p>The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE:  Let me thank you very much. And I think you can just look at the activity on the dais of members coming in and out and this is an important hearing.</p><p>And Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I thank you for holding this hearing.  Many of us are in a number of different hearings, and so we're very appreciative of this particular meeting.</p><p>I would like to focus on some of the issues that you have addressed, but allow me the benefit of just trying to delve in further.</p><p>I don't take ownership of this, but what I will take ownership of is the very interesting and important byline here; fight online theft.  And I think each and every witness here from the government on would say that you are unanimously in support of fighting online theft.  Is that -- and I think I need yeses so it will be audible.</p><p>MS. JONES:  Yes, Congresswoman.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  Yes.</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yes.</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  Yes.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  In the course of that, the documentation notes 2.5 million jobs lost to counterfeiting, 135 billion (dollars) total global sales of counterfeit goods.  I've seen it as I've traveled -- 75 billion (dollars) cost of -- (inaudible) -- piracy of copyright; 1.7 trillion (dollars) by 2015.</p><p>I think that is an enormous dent in the genius of America and the creation of jobs.  I really think we're talking about jobs.  So I want to ask questions -- let me just go right to Google because I, frankly, think it's important that you're here.  I feel that there's going to be legislation, but it will not be punitive, and it should not be punitive.  It should be collaborative.  And I encourage the collaborative process.</p><p>I'll use a term web crawling to identify -- and I want to know the difficulty that Google would have in identifying and working with better placement, site placement and, as well, the taking down.  Give me -- you are committed and know that there is a job issue here.  But I want you to know there's a genius issue here.  We're proud of Google.  We're proud of all of the witnesses that are here as it relates to their input into this economy and to the new job creator of the 21st century and to the 22nd century.</p><p>We're discovering something every single minute.  The better discoveries we make -- or as my son explains to me, the development side of the business and the, if you will, the programmer or the person who is coming up with the ideas -- the better off we are.</p><p>But can you tell me what would be the challenge for a greater engagement in the work of taking these sites down?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  Congresswoman, thank you.</p><p>The key issue is the need for collaboration and identification of who the bad guys are, sorting out the baby from the bathwater.  And we already do a lot of that on the DMCA side.  We hear from the content industry.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  So do you have a team -- you know, do you have a department, a section that deals with that?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yes, we do.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  That has the expertise?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Yes, we do.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  All right.  So those individuals could give us input into the crafting of the legislation, to be honest with you?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  No, absolutely.  And we'd be delighted to work with both this subcommittee and the folks over at the Senate to try and make sure that we're coming up with a refined definition of who the bad guys really are.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Before I get to the other witnesses.  Just quickly, what do they do to pull down -- you're pulling down now. What can you do better to pull it down even more?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Sure.  We can do it faster.  We can do it with less friction.  We can make it easier for rightsholders, and they're working on all three of those.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Mr. Morton, you need help.  Your staff is dwarfed by the employees that are in these companies that are sitting with you.  But behind you, I know, are people in different industries -- musicians are being impacted.  People with unique, inventive talents, their products are being taken.  In the old days, you would go to a certain country and find people's pocketbooks were labeled and weren't the correct pocketbook that you thought you were purchasing.</p><p>What is it that -- tools that you need?  I think you need an expanded team in ICE, to be frank with you, that is dedicated solely to this issue.  But give us a point that we can hang our heads on.</p><p>MR. MORTON:  A couple of things.  A real focus on additional tools for foreign actors where there really isn't much based here in the United States, particularly either the dependence or the server. Help from Congress understanding that the challenge here is so much broader than simply the traditional entertainment industry.</p><p>You know, this has gotten to a point where it is an assault on U.S. --</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  So you need -- the foreign element is something we need to include in the legislation and give you tools to reach?  Is that what I'm understanding?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  And helping -- and it's really -- it's a collaborative one.  It's not just government.  It is, again, allowing government to work with the people to my left and to encourage the people to my left to work on this in a collaborative way.  They can do so much more on a grander scale than we do.  We're a specialized tool in the toolbox.  It's important to have us, but we are not the end-all and be-all.</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  Let me just quickly, Mr. Chairman, if I could.</p><p>Mr. Abrams, the First Amendment -- could I just hear your -- this whole question of cyber locking, this whole question of these parasitic sites -- your leadership on the First Amendment -- and I'm thinking about people stealing people's ideas.  We've got to do a statutory fix, I believe.  Is there a comment that you want to expand on?</p><p>MR. ABRAMS:  All I would say is that I agree with you that you need to do something which involves additional methods and enforcement of the copyright law that already exists.  I mean, we have a copyright law.  We're talking about entities that are already routinely and increasingly violating our copyright law by taking -- stealing -- intellectual property that doesn't belong to them.</p><p>And I think one of the main things that you can do which would be constitutional is to come up with a definition -- difficult as it is -- but a definition of a site or a domain that, by its nature, is so overwhelmingly dedicated to copyright infringement that a court can enter an order so designating it and that that order can be used and is available to entities such as but not limited to Google but the whole range of intermediaries in this area who, once they have it, can at least not be in the position of having to decide for themselves on an ad hoc basis all the time whether this is too much taking or that's too much taking.  If we can get a judge, if we can get a magistrate to play that role -- and I think a properly drafted statute can -- I think that would be a very, very big step.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:  And with that --</p><p>REP. JACKSON LEE:  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><person><nameText>REP. GOODLATTE</nameText></person>:   -- the time of the gentlewoman is expired.</p><p>And that's a -- Mr. Abrams' comments are a good note to end the hearing on with one exception.  We are going to submit many questions to the panel for you to answer in writing.  And any other members who wish to do so, will have an opportunity to do so.</p><p>Mr. Watt wants to pose one of those questions which you can answer in writing, but he wants to pose it verbally.  So we're going to yield to him for that purpose, and then we'll conclude the hearing.</p><p>REP. WATT:  I thank the chairman for providing me this opportunity.  And I do this not to get a response today.  It's addressed to Mr. Walker and Ms. Jones.  But it's also addressed to people in the audience who are invested in this issue in various ways.</p><p>It has occurred to me that one of the areas we are going to have to look more aggressively at is the safe harbor notion.  I understand it.  I'm not sure I understand how it's being applied.  But it seems to me that one possibility might be to impose some of the -- a greater obligation than risk on the people who are requesting these takedowns. Rather than just you having potential liability, the people who are best positioned to identify the culprits or the owners of these intellectual property -- songs, material -- that are being counterfeited.</p><p>And when they request you to take something down, what I need to know is what -- is there some viable way to structure something that would put them at risk as opposed to -- in addition to putting you at risk as opposed to just providing an absolute safe harbor here? Because safe harbors, it seems to me, are subject to being more abused than if somebody has some skin in the game, so to speak.</p><p>REP.     :  Would the gentleman yield?</p><p>REP. WATT:  Well, I'm not sure the chairman is going to let me yield --</p><p>REP.     :  Just on the point -- and if I -- one of the things we worried about when we wrote the DMCA -- at least I worried about and expressed at the time -- was that when you a notice and takedown request, who's going to stand up for the First Amendment?  If it's somebody who has a different agenda, you know, the smartest thing for the person who it's directed to is to comply.</p><p>REP. WATT:  Well, all I'm trying to --</p><p>REP.     :  I think this is the issue you're talking about.</p><p>REP. WATT:  -- get all of these issues out.  And so I would welcome written comments from anybody on this whole notion of how the safe harbor works, whether it could work more effectively if we put some additional incentives in for people to put something on the line when they assert that they ought be given a safe harbor.</p><p>And with that, Mr. Chairman -- my, you've changed.  (Laughter.) With that, I yield back.</p><p>REP.     :  And I'm not going to touch that statement. (Laughter.)</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Watt.</p><p>I think I'm the one left that has some questions, and I apologize for running in and out of here, but it's one of those days where several committees are going at the same time.  And, actually, I'll be brief.</p><p>First, there was a statement made earlier -- and I think it was by Attorney Jones, and Attorney Walker responded to it to a certain extent on giving notice.  And I liked that idea of people within the industry giving each other notice of rogue websites and getting them shut down.</p><p>Does anyone on the panel -- and I'll start with you, Mr. Walker -- have any problem with that?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  The challenge, Mr. Chairman, is the verification of what's legitimate and what's illegitimate.  Some of the bills that are being talked about here would have appropriate due process and a court review.  And that's, I think, where we're most comfortable before we're talking about something like taking down somebody's website or cutting off access to their services or advertisement.</p><p>There have been other examples in the pharma case and the like where there are a limited number of authorized websites out there where there may be only 20 people who are allowed to buy ads for pharmaceuticals.  That's somewhat different than in the content industry where there are a million different people.  Everybody who posts something on YouTube, including their home movies, there's a copyrighted act, copyrighted work.</p><p>So we have to be a little careful about that.  That said, we're delighted to work with the rest of the industry to share information. We work, in fact, with ICE.  We have somebody down at the IPR center today helping them get up to speed on some of the technology issues at play here.  I'd be delighted to do that.</p><p>REP.     :  Anyone else care to respond to that?  No?</p><p>MS. JONES:  I will briefly.  I mean, I suggested it.  We like getting information from people, and we like sharing information with other people.  And I think it might be slightly disingenuous to suggest that somebody can't verify that a pharmacy is selling drugs without a prescription.  That's a pretty easy case.</p><p>I will agree that it's much more difficult to determine a genuine Louis Vuitton bag or a song recording that's been authorized by the production company, the distributor, the writer and so on and so forth.</p><p>So the issue is very complicated, but the sharing of information is really, really important.</p><p>REP.     :  Attorney Walker, you noted that the defining a rogue site is not simple.  Would you be able to come up with, at this moment, a definition of what you would propose?</p><p>MR. WALKER:  Absolutely, at least at a level of principle because we thought the comment had come up -- as I refer to my notes here.</p><p>I think we are in the process of actually sharing specific statutory language we proposed.  But at a high level, we'd say there are four key principles to be looked at.  One is that the site is knowingly violating copyright law.  Second is that it contains complete copies of works or counterfeit goods.  Third is that it has a commercial purpose.  And four is that it refuses to respond when notified by rightsowners.</p><p>Within that construct, I think we're comfortable with the notion of a site that's dedicated to infringement.</p><p>REP.     :  Would you agree with me that -- and let's see if my research is right -- you were an assistant United States attorney.</p><p>MR. WALKER ? :  That's correct.</p><p>REP.     :  And I was a United States attorney.  And many times, we have prosecuted people for omission, turning a blind eye.  The scenario I could use is when I made a drug arrest and went into a crack house and there were several individuals who were not particularly selling the drugs but were there facilitating the dealers and knew that it was going on.  Would you agree with me that those individuals would -- could be prosecuted for aiding and abetting?</p><p>MR. WALKER ? :  So long as there's a finding of specific knowledge and intent to have the transaction proceed, yes, sir.</p><p>REP.     :  Sure.  I would think a specific knowledge is here I have the cocaine in my pocket, and I'm going to give it to the guy at the door so he can sell it.  So, you know, I think we get over that hurdle.</p><p>But not equating the industry with that, but don't you think there could be a situation where it may appear that the industry is turning an eye and simply saying, because of cost or other reasons, this is just too much for us to address?</p><p>MR. WALKER ? :  I want to be very clear that we're not saying that.  I recognize that it's a growing problem.  And as I say, it's a frustration for us as it is for the content industry when the bad-guy sites proliferate or change their identity or -- Congressman Issa, earlier, referred to a site that changed its name to avoid detection.</p><p>We have that problem, too.  And it's important to not confuse the message with the messenger.  It's a difficult problem, and we work on it hard every day.</p><p>REP.     :  And please continue.</p><p>One more question I have for the director.  How would enforcement be affected if prior notice of seizure blocking orders was given to parasites before they were shut down?  And how easy is it for websites to change domain names or redirect traffic to other websites?</p><p>MR. MORTON:  The answer to your question depends on whether or not we're in a civil or a criminal context.  I think the government's view in the criminal context would be that we shouldn't alter basic criminal procedure which doesn't provide notice, in most instances, to, you know, government search warrants or arrests prior, obviously, to the execution of the search or the arrest.</p><p>In the civil context, it's a different story, and I think there is, you know, plenty of room for prior notice.  That's a common hallmark of civil enforcement, and I don't see why it would be any different than it is in other areas of the law.</p><p>REP.     :  OK.  Anyone else wish to make a comment pursuant to my questions to the director?  No?</p><p>Well, I think that concludes our hearing today.  I would like to thank our witnesses for their testimony.  I really appreciate you being here.  I certainly want to thank my colleagues for the in-depth questions.</p><p>And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit to the chair additional written questions which we will forward to the witnesses and ask them to respond to as promptly as possible so their answers may be part of the record.  Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional materials for inclusion in the record.</p><p>With that, I again thank the witnesses.  This hearing is adjourned.  (Sounds gavel.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-20110406t5627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52K6-1XF1-JBSW-73G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"26897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Federal News Service, Inc.

The views expressed in this testimony are those of the author.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China is slowly stagnating economically, due to aging and debt. For those who disagree, it is still true that China will remain partly reliant on foreign technology. Beijing is committed to state monopolies in strategic sectors, thus suppressing competition and innovation. China also needs foreign capital and has opened its financial sector to some extent as a draw. (1)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The basic choice for the US is weighing money earned by American technology companies against the harms of supporting the Chinese Communist Party. The US should enforce the rule of law, implement the export control guidelines already passed by Congress, and couple any technology restrictions with capital restrictions. The first step in effective action is documenting the multiple dimensions of the US-China technology relationship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology Relationship Facts</p><p>To protect American technology wisely, policy-makers need to understand the nature of the US-China technology relationship. Person to person exchanges are an important element and some American scientists misrepresent their ties to China, (2) muddying that picture. A complementary gap: there does not appear to be unclassified information on numbers of Chinese nationals working here specifically on technology projects. Those numbers, broken down by sectors and over time, are necessary to ascertain Chinese priorities and US vulnerability.</p><p>Services trade can partially represent person to person exchanges. The second-largest component of US services export to China, after travel, is use of American intellectual property (IP), which rose 12 percent to $8.5 billion in 2018 for the mainland plus a 50-percent jump for Hong Kong to $4.7 billion. (3) Very little of this was exports to foreign affiliates of US parents--it's all going to locals. But the numbers include IP with no advanced technology. Information services exports in particular were less than $1 billion to the mainland and smaller for Hong Kong.</p><p>Goods exports are more precisely defined. American semiconductor and related equipment exports to China climbed 22 percent to a record $9.8 billion in 2019, (4) despite a 12-percent decline in total exports to China. Chip exports to Hong Kong fell 11 percent but added another $4.7 billion. The combined total is also a record. In the past, rising American semiconductor exports were simply part of rising overall exports, but last year chips stood out.</p><p>American direct investment in China can also carry with it advanced technology. Through the first three quarters of 2019, direct investment in mainland China fell 15 percent from the first three quarters of 2018, to $4.6 billion. (5) Direct investment in Hong Kong fell 37 percent to $3.9 billion. At the end of 2018, cumulative American investment in computers and electronic products in China stood at $10.7 billion and had outpaced overall spending. Investment in Hong Kong computers and electronic products was steady at $2.5 billion at the end of 2018.</p><p>American portfolio (securities) investment can help fund Chinese technology programs. In November 2019, the cumulative position stood at $209 billion, 95 percent in corporate stocks. (6) This was a 20-percent increase over the position in November 2018. The figures for Hong Kong are a 5-percent gain to $171 billion, almost all stocks.</p><p>Chinese portfolio investment in the US can be an attempt to acquire technology indirectly, by becoming financially influential in targeted American firms. That spending stood at $1.54 trillion at the end of June 2019, down 4 percent from June 2018. (7) The large majority, though, was held in Treasury bonds. Holdings of American equities were $190 billion, down 12 percent.</p><p>Chinese direct investment can also be an effort to acquire technology. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reports combined Chinese and Hong Kong direct investment at $2.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2019, 50 percent more than the same period of 2018. (8) BEA claims net investment in computer and electronic products was negligible through 2018. The American Enterprise Institute's China Global Investment Tracker is not limited to advanced technology and has the stock of technology investment at better than $20 billion through 2019. However, there has been very little fresh investment since 2016 and even some of that is being rolled back. (9)</p><p>A last category is less conventional than trade and investment but vital in US-China relations: earnings of US affiliates in China. Data are only complete through 2017, prior to the bilateral trade conflict. American majority-owned affiliates in China reported sales of $376 billion in 2017, $86 billion of this in computers and electronic products. (10) Minority-owned affiliates had almost no sales in computers and electronic products. Majority-owned affiliates in computers and electronic products reported $3.6 billion in 2017 capital expenditure in China.</p><p>China's Motives</p><p>US technology firms' willingness to comply with even abusive Chinese policies may be best explained just by those 2017 sales in striking distance of $100 billion. And it can be much starker for individual firms. Lists of companies most dependent on the Chinese market are dominated by technology, featuring Qualcomm, Micron, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and others receiving 30 percent or more of annual revenue from China in one form or another. The forecast is for more: while Beijing massages all its economic statistics, technology consistently outperforms other sectors. One tailored measurement says technology revenue exceeded $1 trillion in 2019, growing far faster than official GDP. (11)</p><p>In contrast, the motivation for China to engage American firms is multi-dimensional. Acquiring advanced technology is obvious but understates the situation. The Chinese economy is slowing, it has run up enormous debt, and its population is aging. In 2010, official GDP growth was said to be 10.6 percent, in 2019 it was 6.1 percent and most likely slower. While many observers cannot imagine Chinese GDP growth below 2 percent within a decade, that is a simple trend.</p><p>It's also a sophisticated trend. The World Bank says gross fixed capital formation--investment that actually contributes to GDP--stood at $5.7 trillion in 2018. Yet China reported its benchmark measure of investment at $9.4 trillion. (12) Not all of that difference is outright wasted, but a fair chunk is. This is confirmed by the Bank of International Settlements, which has outstanding credit as a share of GDP rising more than 100 percentage points from the start of the global financial crisis to the third quarter of 2019. The equivalent American rise is 20 points (despite a recent surge in the US federal deficit). (13) China is borrowing more, to grow slower.</p><p>Its demographics are also deteriorating. Median age is estimated at over 38 for 2020, headed to 47 by 2045. (14) The latter is approximately Japan's median now. US median age is very similar to China's today but will be a full five years younger in 2045. The Communist Party is well aware of debt and aging and frequently cites innovation as the key to avoid stagnation. But the Party is intolerant of competition, reserving perhaps two dozen sectors to state monopoly. Firms which do not have to compete have much less reason to innovate and in fact state-owned enterprises are less innovative. (15) In those sectors, China will continue to rely on foreign technology.</p><p>This reliance is not Beijing's only motive, though. Much attention has been paid to China's edge in \"big data\"--population size is said to bolster firms who can gather information on consumer behavior. While this is true with regard to competition within China, distortions in the home market make Chinese data considerably less valuable to competition overseas. This is one motive for firms such as Alibaba to gather foreign data through the Belt and Road and an additional motive for China to solicit American firms that hold large quantities of consumer data.</p><p>A third motive is financial. American technology firms make money in China, and China makes money from American firms' technology. It's difficult to measure all the ways in which foreign technology is lucrative but China's $1-trillion home market is suggestive. Especially valuable is foreign exchange, which funds the Belt and Road and possible acquisitions of more foreign technology. In some years, the single biggest contributor to Beijing's foreign reserves has been telecom equipment exports to the US, which passed $80 billion annually before falling back in 2019. (16) The Party's ideal is to use the proceeds to fund China's own technology development.</p><p>Policy responses</p><p>The US government should act only rarely when the aim is profitability--that is a matter for the private sector. Many complaints by American technology companies about China concern barriers to profitability and it is not a core government responsibility to help already prospering firms do still better. Government intervention in this case is primarily about when to sacrifice profitability for the sake of broader national interests, There are multiple issues that require setting aside some private sector goals.</p><p>1) The rule of law is often skipped over or assumed, but should not be when China is involved. Huawei is now under federal indictment for both racketeering and theft of trade secrets, yet the administration continues to hand out temporary general licenses for the sake of American firms gaining from Huawei business. Chinese firms have for years ignored disclosure requirements for listing on US stock exchanges, yet calls for delisting are resisted on the basis of wildly exaggerating the cost. (17) If our existing laws and regulations are not enforced properly, creating new policies is mere posturing.</p><p>2) The Department of Commerce's Entity List effectively encourages offshoring by restricting only US-based exports. Commerce's proposed (in December) implementation of a May 2019 executive order on supply chain security is vague (18) and could be altered at any time, both of these features increasing uncertainty for little reason evident to date. Congress passed new export control guidelines in summer 2018 on a bipartisan basis. In the 20 months since, draft regulations have been issued for one technology. The most important step in changing the US-China technology relationship is implementing Congressionally-mandated changes to export controls.</p><p>3) While capital flows are not typically seen as vital for national security, capital is a partial substitute for technology. Whatever the level of technological restriction--from minimal to sweeping--capital restriction must reinforce it. It would be self-defeating for the US to block transfer of a technology yet permit unrestricted investment in China's efforts to develop it locally. Because China can raise money from other rich countries, the US must pressure friends and allies not to provide capital to firms or programs chasing restricted technology. This will require a clear and consistent American rationale, and possibly a clear and consistent threat. (19)</p><p>4) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been the first line of defense for advanced technology. However, the low volume of recent Chinese investment means CFIUS should focus at present on identifying patterns in small transactions. Mitigation may not be required but these cases help identify China's tactics and priorities, improving policy-making. A particular recommendation: approval of initial investment should not create presumption of approval for additional investment, to guard against the tactic of a first, innocent foot in the door.</p><p>In any action along these lines, the US should deemphasize individual Chinese companies. For the economic reasons outlined above, as well as socio-political reasons, the Communist Party works hard to dictate technology development. The goal is to benefit Chinese technology firms only as part of benefiting the Party. It's the Party that orders large-scale programs and subsidies at home and acquisitions and theft overseas. It's the Party that coerces. The US should not focus on a few Chinese enterprises but instead think in terms of whole supply chains and industries.</p><p>Derek Scissors</p><p>Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute</p><p>March 4, 2020</p><p>(1) KPMG, \"Accelerated Opening Up of China's Financial Sector,\" July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/cn/pdf/en/2019/07/accelerated-opening-up-of-china-s-financial-sector.pdf\">https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/cn/pdf/en/2019/07/accelerated-opening-up-of-china-s-financial-sector.pdf</url>.</p><p>(2) Ellen Barry and Gina Kolata, \"China's Lavish Funds Lured U.S. Scientists.

But it seems unlikely lawmakers will pass up a chance to grill Facebook executives in a public setting.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, has already expressed concerns about how Libra, which Facebook says will be anonymous and managed by a Swiss nonprofit called the Libra Association, will handle certain privacy issues.</p><p>And at least one other senator on the committee has made up his mind that the project fits into what he considers the larger machinations of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive. </p><p>\"He wants to control the world's money supply,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"What could possibly go wrong?\"</p><p>Other lawmakers are hopeful for a set of more substantive hearings. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who represents parts of Silicon Valley, says he wants the committees to address privacy and how Libra might affect competition within the fintech industry. He doesn't want lawmakers to grab the spotlight.</p><p>\"People have to do their homework,\" Khanna said. \"This shouldn't just be based on soundbites.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook said the company looks forward \"to working with lawmakers as this process moves forward, including answering their questions at the upcoming\" hearings.</p><p>Privacy will be primary</p><p>Assuming representatives from Facebook or the Libra Association testify at one or both hearings next week -- witness lists have not been released  -- the consensus among industry observers is that the most serious inquiries from lawmakers will deal with the privacy of Libra's users.</p><p>For instance, critics like Brown have pointed out Facebook's slew of privacy troubles over the past few years and wondered if the company plans to collect and maintain users' financial data gathered through Libra.</p><p>\"Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users' data without protecting their privacy,\" Brown said on Twitter following the announcement of Libra. \"We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.\"</p><p>Others are likely to ask about the extent of Libra's promised anonymity. Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., who sits on the Financial Services Committee and co-chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, told CQ Roll Call that full anonymity could attract use by criminal traffickers and money launderers.</p><p>If Libra is indeed completely anonymous, Foster wants to know whether a judge would have the ability to reveal the identities behind a fraudulent transaction, or reverse a mistaken one. \"I foresee big political problems if this is a truly anonymous and irreversible transaction,\" Foster said.</p><p>Another issue that may come up is whether Facebook's entry into the cryptocurrency market violates antitrust laws designed to protect consumers by ensuring robust competition. The House Judiciary Committee is already investigating possible antitrust violations by Big Tech companies and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has proposed breaking up companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>Some lawmakers, such as Silicon Valley's Khanna, want to make sure Libra won't smother opportunities for other blockchain companies. Facebook may avoid facing greater antitrust concerns because the Libra Association is likely to remain a separate entity, said Smith from the Blockchain Association. But if the company seeks to build Libra functionalities into its platform, it could raise suspicions.</p><p>Smith is hoping that some lawmakers ask how Congress can help make cryptocurrencies more ubiquitous. One of the group's legislative priorities is a tax exemption for transactions under a certain amount so that a cryptocurrency can be used for everyday transactions without needing to declare capital gains. Currently, cryptocurrencies are viewed as properties, which are subject to capital gains taxes. A bill (HR 2144) that would accomplish this has been introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla.</p><p>But largely, the industry's main goal is to get lawmakers excited about cryptocurrency while maintaining a healthy distance from Facebook.</p><p>\"Our big message to the Hill is: Don't lump everyone in with Facebook,\" Smith said. \"It's a little complicated but these things are ultimately a force for good.\"</p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2019 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

I\u2019d kind of like to try to get some answers,\u2019\u201d said Senate President Larry Obhof, a Medina Republican.</p><p>While it\u2019s too soon to say what action \u2014 if any \u2014 state lawmakers might take to rein in these companies, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair John Eklund noted that Ohio\u2019s anti-trust law hasn\u2019t been substantially updated in a \u201cvery, very long time.\u201d</p><p>However, Eklund, a Geauga County Republican, added that state lawmakers must be mindful not to violate the U.S. Constitution, which gives the federal government the sole power to regulate interstate commerce.</p><p>Yost, who also spoke at the news conference, said Ohioans should pay attention to what firms like Google and Facebook are doing.</p><p>\u201cGoogle knows your search-engine interests going back many, many years. Facebook knows your interests going back many, many years. They\u2019re selling that,\u201d Yost said. \u201cWhy do they get to have that forever just because you signed up to use their platform?\u201d</p><p>Traditionally, anti-trust cases involve companies that dominate a particular market so much they can stifle competition and inflate prices. But Yost said the investigation into tech companies is different, because Facebook and Google make their billions not from charging users, but from collecting information on them to sell to advertisers.</p><p>During the hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear not only from anti-trust lawyers and law enforcement, but also tech experts, Eklund said. The meetings, which are open to the public, will be held Oct. 17 at Cleveland State University and Oct. 28 at the University of Cincinnati.</p><p>While Yost, Eklund and Obhof only mentioned Google and Facebook during Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Eklund said the hearings will cover large tech firms in general, not just those two companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLEVPD-MERLIN_87401704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLEVPD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-00M1-JCTS-G00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

But the social media giants are less seen now as angels of freedom than often purveyors of murderous hatred across Myanmar, Cameroon, Nigeria and Kenya.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's untraceable \"dark money\" ads still inflame right-wing populism, while its Cambridge Analytica scandal distorted democracy on three continents, for which it paid $5.1bn in fines to the US Federal Trade Commission last July. Facebook's share price immediately spiked. Just the cost of doing business for behemoths that routinely shift vast profits offshore into lax data-regulatory, tax-havenish jurisdictions like our own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sadly, Ireland gets scant mention in this often jaw-dropping tome by this spiky American Financial Times business columnist. Foroohar's last book, Makers and Takers (2016) detailed the \"financialisation\" of our economies. In the US, finance generates only 4 per cent of jobs but a quarter of all corporate profits; often on the back of complex, risky trading. Meanwhile, old-fashioned lending to the \"real economy\" has dwindled alarmingly.</p><p>Foroohar sees Big Tech as \"the apex of financialisation\": its gargantuan revenues predicated on the remorseless monetisation of the data of \"users\". Big Tech's market capitalisations now dwarf the largest financial firms. Apple was the first corporation to pass the trillion-dollar mark in 2018.</p><p>Since the crash, low interest rates have seen soaring markets awash with cheap money; with big corporations borrowing to buy back their own stocks; artificially inflating share prices, while enriching investors and execs at the expense of workers and taxpayers. Apple, Faroohar reports, has about $210 billion in cash, $110 billion in debt, and conducted a quarter of the $407 billion in US stock buybacks in the six months after Trump's tax cuts in 2017.</p><p>Top firms also borrow to buy up other riskier, higher-yielding corporate debt. This unregulated corporate bond market has grown a record 70 per cent in the past decade, reaching $10.17 trillion in 2018. Big Tech also leads the dubious rise in \"intangible\" assets - intellectual property: brands, software, \"R&amp;D\". Foroohar sees the digital giants as \"too-big-to-fail\" institutions, holding assets that, if dumped or downgraded, could trigger the next global crisis.</p><p>Foroohar worked in tech venture capital before the dotcom bust, and sees parallels: booming markets, cheap money and top-end tax reductions feeding into speculative investments. Witness the inflated valuations of Silicon Valley \"unicorns\": Uber, Airbnb, WeWork and even Netflix. Foroohar asserts we are again in the \"late stages of a credit cycle, with too much money chasing too little value\".</p><p>Foroohar interviews engineers, execs, disgruntled employees, rueful lawyers and venture capitalists like one-time Facebook investor Roger McNamee, pitching his book, Zucked. She wryly appraises Valley culture with its \"core Ayn Rand libertarianism beneath its hippie patina\" and contempt for government. Take Palantir's Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter who wants California to secede from the US. He once funded a plan for an archipelago of floating islands. He and other Valley billionaires maintain survivalist hideaways in remote wildernesses.</p><p>Many seem unhinged and testosterone- troubled. Former Uber boss Travis Kalanick (who cashed in more than $2.5bn worth of stock before Christmas) was ousted in 2017 for misogyny at the company he called \"Boober\". Amazon's Jeff Bezos (the world's richest man) \"sexted\" multiple \"penis selfies\" to a Fox News personality. In 2018 Google paid its Android founder, Andy Rubin, a $90m departing bonus to smother another allegation. As Foroohar notes, in the previous two years, 48 \"Googlers\" had been \"terminated\" for sexual harassment, including 13 \"senior managers and above\". And Elon Musk bumbles on, pumping millions into life-extension research and colonising Mars, in between catastrophic rants fuelled on cannabis and whiskey.</p><h>The field of captology </h><p>Visiting Google's Stanford alma mater, Foroohar enters the field of \"captology\" with BJ Fogg and his Persuasive Technology Lab inspired by BF Skinner's work with lab rats and \"intermittent variable rewards\" - precisely the mechanism behind the casino slot machine. Fogg's lab birthed Instagram's founders before Facebook came seeking his wisdoms on \"addictive technologies\".</p><p>It's dispiriting to read of Google's early campaign to devalue intellectual property up to their rollback of patent protection under a starstruck Obama. In 2018, led by Google, Big Tech spent a record $224.6 million on federal lobbying; second only to Big Pharma. Google lavishly \"grooms\" academics and civil society groups. As a source told Foroohar: \"it's about social and intellectual capture\". Shockingly, Google paid $850,000 in research grants to the FTC's chief technologist Lorrie Cranor, thus gagging the regulator.</p><p>Foroohar warms to thinkers like mathematician Cathy O'Neil, ballsy neuroscientist Vivienne Ming and Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. Personal data is the issue. Foroohar cites a paper calculating the value of US user data to internet platforms, data brokers, credit card companies and one healthcare firm at $76 billion in 2018 - double the 2016 total, and looking to double again by 2022.</p><p>Since EU legislation on data protection, this feeding frenzy has become visible. To access websites, we must allow them and third-parties track us across the net and across devices - just like Facebook, even if you never signed up. Click on \"show vendors\" and see these swarms of mysterious entities.</p><p>Such universal surveillance borders on the totalitarian. George Soros, who survived Nazi-occupied Hungary, has made \"alliances between authoritarian states and these large, data-rich IT monopolies\" a plank of Open Society's research. When Facebook was roasted after the 2016 US presidential election, it hired a right-wing attack-dog PR firm - Definers Public Affairs, based in Arlington, Virginia - to portray its critics as pawns of George Soros.</p><p>While Google and Facebook observe censorship requirements in China, Amazon closed shop there last April due to Alibaba's competition. Back home, Amazon was pipped by Microsoft on the $10bn \"Jedi\" cloud computing contract with the Pentagon, but Foroohar notes the deal they signed with 1,500 US public agencies to provide office supplies - allowing Amazon deploy \"dynamic pricing\"; ie, charge whatever they like.</p><p>A recent Channel 4 Dispatches programme found Amazon has landed a \u00a3300m public procurement deal in Yorkshire, while the UK government has paid Amazon \u00a378m for web services to government departments such as Justice, Health and the Tax Office which, since 2017, has awarded over \u00a326m in contracts to Luxembourg-based Amazon Web Services. It will be interesting to see who wins the Irish contract to provide online services for the NTMA's Strategic Banking Corporation in 2020, with all those friendly data giants in town.</p><p>Faroohar devotes but a few pages to fintech; with one mention of Facebook's Libra e-currency. But she cites a paper by Cornell professor Saule Omarova, identifying such cryptocurrencies as major potential destabilisers of financial markets.</p><p>Facebook's faintly extraterrestrial chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was again quizzed on Capitol Hill last October for five hours by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among others, but he gave nothing away. Foroohar now sits on the advisory board of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank hell-bent on breaking up the online monopolies - a cause embraced by Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren. But Big Tech will fight like hellcats against any threat to their bottom line.</p><p>Foroohar's footnotes alone are a treasury of online resources. She hits some strange notes, but she's a sharp and personable narrator, writing with opinionated, sweeping style. This an important book for anyone engaged with one of the most pressing realities of our times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4143562</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0W-6X91-JC8Y-805D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000DIMS</classCode><className>FIRST-CORP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the longest time, Canada's best hopes for reining in the burgeoning power of Facebook, Google and Big Tech were in the international sphere, leaning on global organizations to negotiate rules where everyone plays along and no one can be singled out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our former finance minister, Bill Morneau, will persist with that campaign as he tries to win the top position at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is consumed with the global talks (such as they are) on digital taxation.</p><p>He will pitch himself as a go-between, someone who can bridge deep differences between the United States and the European Union around how to treat Big Tech.</p><p>We could hope he makes some headway, but it's a long shot. He is competing against strong candidates. And even if he wins, the international talks are stalled, each side digging in its heels.</p><p>It's becoming clearer and clearer, most recently in Australia, that the real decisions need to be made at the national level - and will require some chutzpa.</p><p>There's no doubt that reining in the reach and the wealth of Big Tech is a global affair. But waiting for global action is just taking too long.</p><p>\"Dealing with social media regulation is a global problem,\" says Fenwick McKelvey of Concordia University in Montreal. \"There needs to be a way forward; but there's no clear way forward.\"</p><p>The pandemic economy has amplified the power of the digital behemoths, and the dynamics between the so called FAANGS (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and consumers, the media and the advertisers who rely on digital distribution have become more intense as our nondigital world has shut down. Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of the FAANGS has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages. Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, says McKelvey. We can learn the price of taking them on, and figure out how much we can stomach.</p><p>Canada should also be looking at how Australia has flexed its oversight-of-competition muscles to get to Big Tech, says Sara Bannerman, a McMaster University associate professor and research chair in communication policy and governance.</p><p>Canada's main approach has been to focus on copyright infringements and how copyright law can be used to ensure web platforms don't take creative content unfairly, she says. But Australia looked at the issues through the prism of competition, focusing on the relative bargaining power of Big Tech and domestic media, and acting as a referee in mandated negotiations.</p><p>It's an interesting approach to a difficult set of problems, she says, and something Canada could learn from.</p><p>And given the slow pace of global talks and the iffy prospect of a Morneau leadership at the OECD, it's probably a much faster route than hoping international organizations figure it out for us.</p><p>Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of the FAANGS has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages. Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, says McKelvey. We can learn the price of taking them on, and figure out how much we can stomach.</p><p>Canada should also be looking at how Australia has flexed its oversight-of-competition muscles to get to Big Tech, says Sara Bannerman, a McMaster University associate professor and research chair in communication policy and governance.</p><p>Canada's main approach has been to focus on copyright infringements and how copyright law can be used to ensure web platforms don't take creative content unfairly, she says. But Australia looked at the issues through the prism of competition, focusing on the relative bargaining power of Big Tech and domestic media, and acting as a referee in mandated negotiations.</p><p>It's an interesting approach to a difficult set of problems, she says, and something Canada could learn from.</p><p>And given the slow pace of global talks and the iffy prospect of a Morneau leadership at the OECD, it's probably a much faster route than hoping international organizations figure it out for us.</p><p>Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the longest time, Canada's best hopes for reining in the burgeoning power of Facebook, Google and Big Tech were in the international sphere, leaning on global organizations to negotiate rules where everyone plays along and no one can be singled out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our former finance minister, Bill Morneau, will persist with that campaign as he tries to win the top position at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is consumed with the global talks (such as they are) on digital taxation.</p><p>He will pitch himself as a go-between, someone who can bridge deep differences between the United States and the European Union around how to treat Big Tech.</p><p>We could hope he makes some headway, but it's a long shot. He is competing against strong candidates. And even if he wins, the international talks are stalled, each side digging in its heels.</p><p>It's becoming clearer and clearer, most recently in Australia, that the real decisions need to be made at the national level - and will require some chutzpa.</p><p>There's no doubt that reining in the reach and the wealth of Big Tech is a global affair. But waiting for global action is just taking too long.</p><p>\"Dealing with social media regulation is a global problem,\" says Fenwick McKelvey of Concordia University in Montreal. \"There needs to be a way forward; but there's no clear way forward.\"</p><p>The pandemic economy has amplified the power of the digital behemoths, and the dynamics between the so called FAANGS (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and consumers, the media and the advertisers who rely on digital distribution have become more intense as our nondigital world has shut down. Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of the FAANGS has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages. Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, says McKelvey. We can learn the price of taking them on, and figure out how much we can stomach.</p><p>Canada should also be looking at how Australia has flexed its oversight-of-competition muscles to get to Big Tech, says Sara Bannerman, a McMaster University associate professor and research chair in communication policy and governance.</p><p>Canada's main approach has been to focus on copyright infringements and how copyright law can be used to ensure web platforms don't take creative content unfairly, she says. But Australia looked at the issues through the prism of competition, focusing on the relative bargaining power of Big Tech and domestic media, and acting as a referee in mandated negotiations.</p><p>It's an interesting approach to a difficult set of problems, she says, and something Canada could learn from.</p><p>And given the slow pace of global talks and the iffy prospect of a Morneau leadership at the OECD, it's probably a much faster route than hoping international organizations figure it out for us.</p><p>Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the longest time, Canada's best hopes for reining in the burgeoning power of Facebook, Google and Big Tech were in the international sphere, leaning on global organizations to negotiate rules where everyone plays along and no one can be singled out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our former finance minister, Bill Morneau, will persist with that campaign as he tries to win the top position at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is consumed with the global talks (such as they are) on digital taxation.</p><p>He will pitch himself as a go-between, someone who can bridge deep differences between the United States and the European Union around how to treat Big Tech.</p><p>We could hope he makes some headway, but it's a long shot. He is competing against strong candidates. And even if he wins, the international talks are stalled, each side digging in its heels.</p><p>It's becoming clearer and clearer, most recently in Australia, that the real decisions need to be made at the national level - and will require some chutzpa.</p><p>There's no doubt that reining in the reach and the wealth of Big Tech is a global affair. But waiting for global action is just taking too long.</p><p>\"Dealing with social media regulation is a global problem,\" says Fenwick McKelvey of Concordia University in Montreal. \"There needs to be a way forward; but there's no clear way forward.\"</p><p>The pandemic economy has amplified the power of the digital behemoths, and the dynamics between the so called FAANGS (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and consumers, the media and the advertisers who rely on digital distribution have become more intense as our nondigital world has shut down. Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of the FAANGS has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages. Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, says McKelvey. We can learn the price of taking them on, and figure out how much we can stomach.</p><p>Canada should also be looking at how Australia has flexed its oversight-of-competition muscles to get to Big Tech, says Sara Bannerman, a McMaster University associate professor and research chair in communication policy and governance.</p><p>Canada's main approach has been to focus on copyright infringements and how copyright law can be used to ensure web platforms don't take creative content unfairly, she says.

He is competing against strong candidates. And even if he wins, the international talks are stalled, each side digging in its heels.</p><p>It's becoming clearer and clearer, most recently in Australia, that the real decisions need to be made at the national level - and will require some chutzpa.</p><p>There's no doubt that reining in the reach and the wealth of Big Tech is a global affair. But waiting for global action is just taking too long.</p><p>\"Dealing with social media regulation is a global problem,\" says Fenwick McKelvey of Concordia University in Montreal. \"There needs to be a way forward; but there's no clear way forward.\"</p><p>The pandemic economy has amplified the power of the digital behemoths, and the dynamics between the so called FAANGS (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and consumers, the media and the advertisers who rely on digital distribution have become more intense as our nondigital world has shut down. Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of the FAANGS has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages. Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, says McKelvey. We can learn the price of taking them on, and figure out how much we can stomach.</p><p>Canada should also be looking at how Australia has flexed its oversight-of-competition muscles to get to Big Tech, says Sara Bannerman, a McMaster University associate professor and research chair in communication policy and governance.</p><p>Canada's main approach has been to focus on copyright infringements and how copyright law can be used to ensure web platforms don't take creative content unfairly, she says. But Australia looked at the issues through the prism of competition, focusing on the relative bargaining power of Big Tech and domestic media, and acting as a referee in mandated negotiations.</p><p>It's an interesting approach to a difficult set of problems, she says, and something Canada could learn from.</p><p>And given the slow pace of global talks and the iffy prospect of a Morneau leadership at the OECD, it's probably a much faster route than hoping international organizations figure it out for us.</p><p>Heather Scoffield is the Star's Ottawa bureau chief and an economics columnist.

Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suggested she wants to break up not just Facebook, but Google and Amazon, too.</p><p>But in Canada, we are only months away from the prime minister posing for ribbon-cutting with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, welcoming them to expand their footprints in Canada so they can hire handfuls of people.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>B.C. court allows class-action lawsuit against Facebook to expand</p><p>Canada's privacy watchdogs are taking Facebook to court</p><p>U.K. needs tough new rules on the likes of Facebook and Google, report urges</p><p>\"The economic development frame has been the driver in this space,\" observes Amanda Clarke, an assistant professor at Carleton University.</p><p>Meanwhile, small businesses, especially in the retail sector, find it harder and harder to expand unless they're on Amazon's good side. Music producers and the news industry are seeing their revenues melt away to the massive advertising and publishing power of Google and Facebook, which take little responsibility for curating quality or adhering to copyright, let alone truth. And alarm bells are ringing about children of all ages, so attached to social media that they no longer know how to conduct face-to-face friendships, let alone romance.</p><p>Big Tech's effects on democracy are only a sliver of the ground-shifting effects of these U.S.-based companies and their giant tentacles.</p><p>It's clear that federal policy-makers want to take action. There has been a notable change in attitude in the past few months, with the photo ops and fawning over Big Tech replaced by a growing mortification at the breaches of privacy, the blind eyes to election interference, and the rapid spread of insidious extremism.</p><p>But the will to take action has not yet turned into a full-fledged plan. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould rolled out a package of measures in January to take aim at foreign influence in elections. The government has passed legislation to reform rules around election advertising. And last week, MPs on the ethics committee took the extraordinary step of issuing a formal summons to Facebook executives, telling them they must appear before international hearings on data and democracy at the end of the month.</p><p>If they don't come, they could be held in contempt of Parliament - a deterrent for some, perhaps, but probably not for a company facing the likelihood of a $5-billion U.S. fine for privacy breaches. And we wonder why they won't listen to Canada's privacy commissioner, with his lack of power to levy financial penalties.</p><p>Galvanized by the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in mid-March, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is heading to France this week to meet with other leaders to sign on to a \"Christchurch call\" list of principles that they hope all governments will follow, and that Big Tech will endorse.</p><p>Trudeau will up the ante in a speech on Thursday at a Big Tech conference, challenging the firms to take responsibility for hatred and extremism. With an election in the offing, he will aim to show strong leadership.</p><p>But at this point, he has a narrow definition of the problems, focused on public safety, privacy and electioneering - and leaving the corporate power issues to another day. Taxation, monopolistic power in advertising, copyright, distortion of markets such as transportation and accommodation - none of those, or other unforeseen disruptions, are on the front burner.</p><p>He also has limited policy options. Canada will work with allies through the G7 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop \"best practices.\" But it also has to decide whether it will follow the European Union's hardball regulatory approach to disruption or the more voluntary approach of the United States.</p><p>Here's a quick idea from Clarke: use government procurement to demand higher standards. Governments, she says, have spent years cosying up to technology providers and spending billions on their services. Now is the time to use that purchasing power to at least try to impose some rules around privacy and misinformation.</p><p>Whether Canadian policy-makers can make up for lost time is another question.</p><p>\"We are patching it up,\" Clarke says, \"trying to regain some of that control.\"</p><p>Heather Scoffield is an economics columnist based in Ottawa.

And alarm bells are ringing about children of all ages, so attached to social media that they no longer know how to conduct face-to-face friendships, let alone romance.</p><p>Big Tech's effects on democracy are only a sliver of the ground-shifting effects of these U.S.-based companies and their giant tentacles.</p><p>It's clear that federal policy-makers want to take action. There has been a notable change in attitude in the past few months, with the photo ops and fawning over Big Tech replaced by a growing mortification at the breaches of privacy, the blind eyes to election interference, and the rapid spread of insidious extremism.</p><p>But the will to take action has not yet turned into a full-fledged plan. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould rolled out a package of measures in January to take aim at foreign influence in elections. The government has passed legislation to reform rules around election advertising. And last week, MPs on the ethics committee took the extraordinary step of issuing a formal summons to Facebook executives, telling them they must appear before international hearings on data and democracy at the end of the month.</p><p>If they don't come, they could be held in contempt of Parliament - a deterrent for some, perhaps, but probably not for a company facing the likelihood of a $5-billion U.S. fine for privacy breaches. And we wonder why they won't listen to Canada's privacy commissioner, with his lack of power to levy financial penalties.</p><p>Galvanized by the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in mid-March, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is heading to France this week to meet with other leaders to sign on to a \"Christchurch call\" list of principles that they hope all governments will follow, and that Big Tech will endorse.</p><p>Trudeau will up the ante in a speech on Thursday at a Big Tech conference, challenging the firms to take responsibility for hatred and extremism. With an election in the offing, he will aim to show strong leadership.</p><p>But at this point, he has a narrow definition of the problems, focused on public safety, privacy and electioneering - and leaving the corporate power issues to another day. Taxation, monopolistic power in advertising, copyright, distortion of markets such as transportation and accommodation - none of those, or other unforeseen disruptions, are on the front burner.</p><p>He also has limited policy options. Canada will work with allies through the G7 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop \"best practices.\" But it also has to decide whether it will follow the European Union's hardball regulatory approach to disruption or the more voluntary approach of the United States.</p><p>Here's a quick idea from Clarke: use government procurement to demand higher standards. Governments, she says, have spent years cosying up to technology providers and spending billions on their services. Now is the time to use that purchasing power to at least try to impose some rules around privacy and misinformation.</p><p>Whether Canadian policy-makers can make up for lost time is another question.</p><p>\"We are patching it up,\" Clarke says, \"trying to regain some of that control.\"</p><p>Heather Scoffield is an economics columnist based in Ottawa.
