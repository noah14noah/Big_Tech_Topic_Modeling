The billions who use their services for making social media posts, uploading videos or searching ads are targeted by the tech companies for their personal data - a prized asset that enhances the companies' power. Regulators are examining whether the companies have used their market power to crimp competition, potentially raising prices and hurting consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dissatisfaction with what federal authorities have done so far may be pushing some states to band together to run their own investigations, possibly eyeing more aggressive sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission's recent $5 billion fine against Facebook over privacy violations, for example, was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as being too lenient.</p><p> \"The states see it as part of their role to fill a vacuum,\" said Jay Himes, an antitrust lawyer in New York. Himes, a former head of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office, worked on the states' antitrust case against Microsoft about 20 years ago.</p><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday her probe will look into Facebook's dominance and any resulting anticompetitive conduct.</p><p> A separate group of state attorneys general is announcing Monday in Washington the launch of an investigation into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\" an advisory from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday. The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, citing sources they didn't identify, have reported that target will be Google.</p><p> Both groups of state attorneys general include Democrats and Republicans. Joining James, a Democrat, in the Facebook investigation are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.</p><p> With some 2.4 billion users around the globe and a huge social media presence, Facebook has sparked outrage with a series of privacy scandals and its use by Russian operatives in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p> \"Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,\" James said.</p><p> Critics worry that Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer. That ultimately could reduce viable alternatives for consumers looking, for instance, for comparable services that do less tracking for targeted advertising. Businesses, including mom and pop shops, might have to pay more for ads if they have fewer choices to reach consumers online.</p><p> The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p> The lawmaker leading that investigation, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Friday the states' probe of Facebook is \"completely appropriate.\"</p><p> \"Facebook has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\" Cicilline said.</p><p> The states have the power to make big changes to the tech industry - especially if enough of them band together, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a group that advocates for the breakup of corporate monopolies. Though states have limited jurisdictions, he said, once a few of the bigger states get involved, changes can come that can affect most of the country.</p><p> \"You really have to break their power, and I think the states are more likely to do that than anyone else,\" Stoller said in an interview.</p><p>Facebook said it plans to \"work constructively\" with the state attorneys general and welcomes a conversation with policymakers about competition.</p><p> \"People have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide,\" said Will Castleberry, a vice president of state and local policy. \"We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe.\"</p><p>Google said it welcomes government oversight to make sure companies comply with the law. The company said it has already responded to many government agencies around the world on how it conducts its businesses and expects state attorneys general to ask similar questions.</p><p> \"We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition,\" Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs, said in a blog post.</p><p> Big Tech won't be an easy target. Current interpretations of U.S. law against monopolies don't obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services.</p><p> Traditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically through practices that raise prices for consumers.

Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. </p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said. </p><p>Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ORSENT-OS0101963103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORSENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-9RC1-DY37-F033-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Forty-eight states, led by Texas, and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico announced an investigation into Google's \"potential monopolistic behavior.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Monday announcement closely followed one from a separate group of states Friday that disclosed an investigation into Facebook's market dominance. </p><p>The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators. </p><p>Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a news  conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation. </p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. </p><p>Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's  impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services.</p><p>Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. </p><p>Google expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday. </p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance. </p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business. </p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. </p><p>Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006. </p><p>Joining Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, in the investigation are the attorneys general of almost all U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. </p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" Walker wrote. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\" </p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The states are expected to stage the announcement in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the people said. The plans could change.</p><p>U.S. antitrust enforcers are already investigating the search giant, which is also a major player in online ads and mobile operating systems. The Department of Justice is scrutinizing the latter two operations, Bloomberg has reported.</p><p>The company has faced antitrust investigations in Europe as well. Although states with Democratic attorneys general have recently led the charge on technology and telecommunications issues, the group scrutinizing Google is led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, one of the people said.</p><p>In July, Paxton said that a bipartisan group of eight  state attorneys general spoke with Attorney General William Barr about \"the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the Internet\" and indicated that the state officials were \"considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.\"</p><p>The Justice Department will not be involved in the announcement, one of the people said. The department declined to comment.</p><p>The Washington Post previously reported the state investigation. It was not immediately clear what the probe would focus on or which states would participate.</p><p>A group of state attorneys general said in June at an enforcement workshop hosted by the Federal Trade Commission that they are examining a wide range of practices, including data collection, digital advertising and innovation, among large tech companies.</p><p>Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said the company continues \"to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p><p>States often team up to investigate and sue companies over conduct that is national in scope. Different groups of states sued Standard &amp; Poor's over faulty ratings on mortgage bonds in 2013 and foreclosure practices by banks in 2012. </p><p>The states also negotiated a sweeping settlement with the tobacco industry in the 1990s.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0101306098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYX-GNN1-DY37-F2CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GROUP OF EIGHT (G8)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Many argue that since the internet \u2014 or more specifically broadband and wireless connectivity \u2014 crosses state lines, it is an interstate commerce issue.The Competitive Enterprise Institute's (CEI) Jessica Meluginwrote in February[2], 'it's difficult to imagine an industry more obviously interstate than the Internet.'FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, a Republican, agrees, telling The Daily Caller News Foundation that 'when consumers visit a website or send an email, their data packets are generally not confined to a state, local, or other political boundary.' 'It's fairly problematic. The FCC has ruled under Democrats and Republicans alike that broadband internet access is an inherently interstate offering,' a Washington D.C.-based attorney with telecommunications expertise told TheDCNF. </p><p>'That's the first pretty big roadblock under the commerce clause in the Constitution which regulates that area.' The second hindrance for states, according to the lawyer, who is also a former FCC official, is that past FCC administration's of all political balances have said that state efforts to adopt requirements conflicting with the federal regime would be preempted. 'The 2015 order under [then-FCC] Chairman Tom Wheeler said that, and the current order said that as well,' the legal expert continued. He asked to remain anonymous due to potential complications with his practice and clients. 'Even some of the more cute approaches that some states have taken having to do with state procurement, like requirements, those are also generally inconsistent with the law.' FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's office declined to provide insight into the situation, but did point to the preemption section of the2017 final order[3], which apparently gives them authority to override states in this respect. Aside from potential legal issues with violating interstate commerce fluidity, O'Rielly believes states cannot technically create their own laws because it 'is impossible to set rules in New York or Montana, that will not impact every other state.' 'A patchwork of state or local laws and/or restrictions will make it impossible for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to follow and this will affect the consumer experience,' the commissioner continues. Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an influential digital privacy rights group, says net neutrality supporters really had no choice. 'In the absence of federal protections, the state, local governments are really the only avenue that remains,' Falcon told TheDCNF. A considerable portion of Congress is currently attempting to pass its own legislation, specifically a Congressional Review Act (CRA)resolution[4]that would undo the FCC's most recent nullification, and effectively re-enact the 2015Open Internet Order[5]. Fifty senators \u2014 47 Democrats, two Independents, and a lone Republican,Sen. Susan Collins of Maine \u2014have so far endorsed the legislative move[6], which some, like Falcon, assert is a legitimate attempt at positive reform (or perhaps more aptly a preservation of post-2015 internet policy). Others argue it's just a cunning and not-so-subtle political maneuver meant to stoke fervor before the 2018 midterms since it likely won't pass all lawmaking steps. When asked about the CRA and if it will conflict with the states' push, Falcon said 'these things move in tandem.' 'You really can't control the organic nature of people, if you will. In terms of people, they expect results from their elected officials,' Falcon continued. And many agree with that perception, just not with the states moving forward, but rather federal officials, so they can decisively end the bureaucratic back-and-forth that has been occurring as the FCC makeup changes concur with presidential administration changes. Fred Royal, president of the Milwaukee Chapter of the NAACP \u2014 who also said that activists with fierce opposition to the undoing of internet regulations from 2015 'are backed by the wealthiest companies in Silicon Valley' \u2014 contends that federal lawmakers, not states, need to take the lead. 'Congress must begin the work to pass a net neutrality law that clearly spellsout the rules of the road: no blocking, no throttlingand no unfair discrimination,' Royalwrote[7]in a USA Today op-ed. 'These rules should apply to all players in the Internet economy, instead of selectively applying them to just broadband providers.' The broadband industry itself, for the most part, says the same. 'Congress should come together and pass bipartisan legislation, which is the best way to enshrine the principles of net neutrality, encourage investment and ensure an open internet continues to work for everyone,' CTIA, the trade association representing many wireless communications corporations,said[8]in a statement. AT...the world's largest telecommunications company,expressed[9]the need for an 'Internet Bill of Rights' earlier in the year, a decisionapplauded[10]by CTIA President and CEO Meredith Atwell Baker. Ferras Vinh of the Center for Democracy ...chnology (CDT) supports strong net neutrality rules, but doesn't think companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix (known as edge providers, which are entities that produce content or provide a service through the internet) should be treated the same when it comes to restrictions \u2014 or what some call, consumer protections. 'While platforms can certainly facilitate communication online, ISPs serve as a gateway to the internet itself,' says Vinh. 'With this in mind, it's important to provide some form of protection or oversight to prevent ISPs from leveraging this position to harm consumers or competition between different platforms.' (Both CDT andEFF[11]receive funding from Google insome capacity[12], and EFF and the tech giant seem to have a sort of 'revolving door[13]' relationship). Not including edge providers when they have a lot of control over making the net neutral, in a somewhatdifferent[14], butstill important[15]sense,[16]isn't considered a smart prospect for all left-leaning parties. 'Everyone understands that the internet is the new town square \u2014 our first stop for news, culture, work or access to the government. It must be protected and kept free and open for all,'wrote[17]Ev Ehrlich[18], the former U.S. undersecretary of commerce in then-President Bill Clinton's administration. 'No one \u2014 whether it's a search engine, social media platform or internet provider \u2014 should be allowed to line their pockets by blocking or censoring internet traffic or manipulating the flow of data to choke off competition.' There have beenother attempts[19]at federal legislation besides the CRA, like Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn's Open Internet Preservation Act, which so far seems to only have received limited, if not minimal, enthusiasm. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana recently proposed his own bill rather thanjoining[20]his one fellow party colleague, Collins, in support of the CRA \u2014 something that drew theire[21]of the aforementioned activists supporting the CRA, which is a complete reversion to 2015-2017 FCC policy. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is also considering, or already in the process of, creating his own legislation in an attempt to end the exhausting squabbling, a source with firsthand knowledge of prospective net neutrality bills told TheDCNF. Nevertheless, as Falcon noted, states are pushing ahead so they can ensure that something gets done in this respect \u2014 forbidding and preventing unfair or restrictive actions \u2014 even if some believe it's not practical or legal. Practicality and legality, according to Vinh, depends on how the rules are applied. 'In many cases, it's an unsettled legal question. The FCC included language in its repeal to preempt states and localities from implementing net neutrality protections,' says Vinh. 'But states have chosen to pursue protections through different avenues. From a legal perspective, it appears likely that states can contract with ISPs to ensure that the service that they provide to the government complies with principles of net neutrality.' The state of Washington[22] is moving ahead regardless of ostensible operational or regulatory uncertainty. Earlier in March, Washington Governor Jay Insleesigned[23] the nation's first state law aimed at safeguarding or locally bringing back the recently nixed net neutrality rules. 'Washington state's new net neutrality law underscores what we all know: that a substantial majority of the public is in favor of net neutrality protections,' Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn told TheDCNF. 'I commend Gov. Inslee and the Washington state legislature for listening to their constituents and ensuring that the citizens of Washington continue to experience a free and open internet.' Washington's attorney general is alsojoining[24]20 other state chief law enforcement officers in challenging the FCC's 2017 mandated repeal in court. 'We believe the FCC acted unlawfully when it gutted net neutrality, and I look forward to holding the FCC accountable to the rule of law,'said[25]Washington A.G. Bob Ferguson. The consensus on state's legislative endeavors is, as many issues naturally are, divided, but not as clearly across party lines as it seems. 'The neutrality issue has a bipartisan pedigree going back to the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was championed by the Clinton administration, which I was a part of,' said Ehrlich. 'But every law needs to evolve with the times Congress has the power to pass a permanent, strong net neutrality law today \u2014 one that applies not just to the cable, telecom, mobile and satellite service providers, but the Big Tech monopoly platforms that dominate our lives and activities online.' Ehrlich clarifies though that the CRA is not what he means by 'strong' because 'that will leave the issue in the hands of the FCC rather than a substantive law that will genuinely fix the problem.' He continues: On the far left, many seem happy to sacrifice net neutrality regulation as a stalking horse for nationalizing the internet and regulating it into submission. Like the animals who wouldn't help the Little Red Hen, they're happy to enjoy high-speed broadband (except when they complain about how much better it ought to be) but unwilling to work with the companies that have spent over a trillion dollars to build it.His criticism wasn't just directed at one distant end of the political spectrum, which seems to bedominating[26]the more superficial aspects of the debate. 'Rather than a law establishing modest ground rules for cyberspace, the far right seems to prefer a Wild West internet that leaves the tech monopolies free to scrape valuable content, pick through user data, and decide what we can do and see online,' argues Ehrlich. Overall, the issue of net neutrality, and what is the best way to ensure that tech companies don't take advantage of their stature in the market, has been, and still is, extremely divisive (even vitriolic[27]). States' advances in creating their own separate laws, for example, are met with both heavy scrutiny and support. What a bipartisan, all-encompassing legislative effort to clarify rules surrounding net neutrality looks like is not yet clear. But what is becoming more clear by the day is the desire for Congress to do something about the uncertainty. If they don't, 5G, or the next generation of wireless technology, and its comprehensive implementation in America could falter, according to Ryan Radia, regulatory counsel and research fellow at CEI. 'If states are able to Balkanize the internet through regulation,' says Radia, 'the deployment of 5G will suffer.'Republished by permission. Original here[28].

Which may be impossible</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Years ago, long before Mark Zuckerberg became Mark Zuckerberg, the young founder reached out to a friend of mine who had also started a social-media company, albeit a considerably smaller one, and suggested that they get together. As Facebook has grown into a global colossus that connects about a third of the world, Zuckerberg has subsequently assumed a reputation as an aloof megalomaniac who is deeply out of touch with the people who use his product. But back then, when Facebook had only 100 million users, he wasn't quite perceived that way. When he contacted my friend, Zuckerberg was rather solicitous. He made overtures that suggested a possible acquisition-and, once rebuffed, returned with the notion that Facebook could at least partner with my friend's company. The chief executive of the little start-up was excited by the seemingly harmless proposition from the growing hegemon. Zuckerberg suggested that the two guys take a walk.</p><p>Taking a walk, it should be noted, was Zuckerberg's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thing.</emphasis> He regularly took potential recruits and acquisition targets on long walks in the nearby woods to try to persuade them to join his company. After the walk with my friend, Zuckerberg appeared to take the relationship to the next level. He initiated a series of conference calls with his underlings in Facebook's product group. My friend's small start-up shared its product road map with Facebook's business-development team. It all seemed very collegial, and really exciting. And then, after some weeks passed, the C.E.O. of the little start-up saw the news that Facebook had just launched a new product that competed with his own. After all that obsequiousness, it looked as if his company was toast.</p><p>Stories about Zuckerberg's ruthlessness are now the stuff of legend, immortalized by Aaron Sorkin's cynical portrayal of him in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Social Network.</emphasis> Facebook, after all, has behaved as a bully could be expected to when it is vying for global dominance-slurping the lifeblood out of its competitors (as it did most recently with Snap, after C.E.O. Evan Spiegel also rebuffed Zuckerberg's acquisition attempt), blatantly copying key features (as it did with Snapchat's Stories), usurping ideas (remember those Winklevoss twins?), and poaching senior executives (the joint is crawling with former Twitter, Google, and Apple personnel).</p><p>Zuckerberg may look aloof, but there are stories of him giving rousing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Braveheart</emphasis>-esque speeches to employees, sometimes using Latin. (He compared the threat of the ill-fated Google Plus to the start of the Punic Wars.) A former employee of the company once told me that Zuckerberg's strategy is really quite simple: first he tries to buy you, then he tries to kill you. Twitter, Snap, and Foursquare have all been marooned or impeded, at various points, because of Facebook's implacable desire to grow. Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, among others, are breathing life because they assented to Facebook's acquisition desires. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg moved quickly to circumnavigate regulations before governments realized the problems that Facebook posed-and certainly before they understood exactly how dangerous a social network could be to privacy and democracy.</p><p>From a business standpoint, Facebook's barbarism seemed to work out well. The social network is now worth more than half a trillion dollars, and Zuckerberg himself is worth roughly $76 billion. Facebook has some of the smartest engineers and executives in the entire industry. But the fallout from that success has also become increasingly obvious, especially since the 2016 election, which prompted a year of public-relations battles over the company's most fundamental problems. In Silicon Valley, many are asking a once unfathomable question: is Facebook in real trouble?</p><p>Facebook's mortality is perhaps best recognized by those who know the company the most intimately. In recent months, several former executives have publicly articulated the perils of social media for their families, society, and democracy. Chamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook executive who now runs the influential venture-capital firm Social Capital, said social networks \"are destroying how society works\"; Sean Parker, Facebook's founding president, said, \"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.\" Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, said he won't let his nephew on social media.</p><p>Privately, early Facebook employees are more morose, with many of them enduring real agony over what they have wrought. \"Most of the early employees I know are totally overwhelmed by what this thing has become,\" the former Facebook employee, who was there in its early years, told me recently. \"They look at the role Facebook now plays in society, and how Russia used it during the election to elect Trump, and they have this sort of 'Oh my God, what have I done?' moment.\" This person confessed to having similar feelings: \"I lie awake at night thinking about all the things we built in the early days and what we could have done to avoid the product being used this way.\" In February, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> reported that a group of early Facebook and Google employees would form a consortium, dubbed the Center for Humane Technology, that would help alert students and others to technology's dangers.</p><p>AS A SOCIETY, WE FEEL AS IF WE'RE AT WAR WITH A COMPUTER ALGORITHM.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook has been left with no choice but to engage with people and the media to explore if it is possible to fix these problems. Zuckerberg determined that his 2018 annual challenge would be fixing his own Web site, noting that \"the world feels anxious and divided,\" and that Facebook might-just maybe-be contributing to that. \"My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues,\" he wrote. Now the company has said it's going to change the focus of the site to be less about news and more about human connections.</p><p>The question, of course, revolves around his underlying motivation. Is Zuckerberg saying this because he really does worry what the world might look like tomorrow if we continue headed in the direction we're going? Is Facebook de-emphasizing news from its site because it realizes that spotting \"fake news\" is too difficult a problem to solve-even for Facebook? Or, as some people have posited to me, is Facebook rethinking the divide it has created in order to keep growing? Much of Zuckerberg's remaining growth opportunity centers on China, and the People's Republic won't let any product (digital or otherwise) enter its borders if there's a chance it could disrupt the government's control. Why would the Chinese politburo open its doors to a force that could conspire in the country's own Trumpification or Brexit or similar populist unrest?</p><p>There's another theory floating around regarding Facebook's concern about the way it's impacting the world, and it's one that I happen to agree with. When Zuckerberg looks into his big-data crystal ball, he can see a troublesome trend occurring. A few years ago, there wasn't a single person I knew who didn't have Facebook on his or her smartphone. These days, it's the opposite. This is largely anecdotal, but almost everyone I know has deleted at least one social-media app from his or her device, and Facebook is almost always the first to go. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and other privacy-piercing applications are being removed by people who simply feel icky about what these platforms are doing to them, and to society. The data seems to support this observation: in late January, Zuckerberg announced that the company's daily active-user number in the U.S. and Canada had declined-albeit from 185 million to 184 million-for the first time in history.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG IS FINALLY OWNING UP TO IT: FACEBOOK IS IN DANGER.</p><p>There are now manifold reasons to hate social media. Some people are terrified that these services are listening in to their private conversations. (The company's anti-privacy tentacles go as far as having the ability to use the dust on your phone's camera lens to figure out where you are based on environmental factors.) Others are sick of getting into an argument with a long-lost cousin, or that guy from high school who still works in the same coffee shop, over something that Trump said, or a \"news\" article that is full of bias and falsehoods. And then there's the main reason I think people are abandoning these platforms: Facebook knows us better than we know ourselves, with its algorithms that can predict if we're going to cheat on our spouse, start looking for a new job, or buy a new water bottle on Amazon in a few weeks. It knows how to send us the exact right number of pop-ups to get our endorphins going, or to not show us how many Likes we really have to set off our insecurities. As a society, we feel as if we're at war with a computer algorithm, and the only winning move is not to play.</p><p>There was a time when Facebook made us feel good about using the service-I used to love it. It was fun to connect with old friends, share pictures of your vacation with everyone, or show off a video of your nephew being extra-specially cute. But, over time, Facebook has had to make Wall Street happy, and the best way to feed that beast is to accumulate more, more, more: more clicks, more time spent on the site, more Likes, more people, more connections, more hyper-personalized ads. All of which adds up to more money. But as one recent <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mea culpa</emphasis> by an early Internet guru aptly noted, \"What if we were never meant to be a global species?\"</p><p>If Facebook doesn't solve these problems, and I'm not sure it actually can, the outcomes could be devastating for the company. As Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and former senior adviser to the Federal Trade Commission, told me recently, Facebook is in danger of running into regulatory hazards, either at home or internationally, where restrictions are traditionally more rigorous. Whether it's over hate speech or privacy protections, governments all around the world are exploring how to stop social-media sites, specifically Facebook, from enabling more harm to spread through society. Wu predicts that if the U.S. government turns its sights on Facebook it could quite easily break the company up, leaving Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook as four separate entities, similar to the way regulators treated AT&amp;T in the 80s. Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, echoed this sentiment in a separate interview with me last year, when he predicted that, among the five big tech companies-Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook-Facebook bears the most legal risk owing to the consistency of its portfolio. Amazon may become our first trillion-dollar company, but it's an amalgamation of a retail colossus, a book business, a supermarket chain, and a TV-and-film studio, among other assets. Facebook, on the other hand, operates four of the world's largest social networks. \"This is serious. Either it's this government or the European government, but this is going to get real,\" Galloway told me.</p><p>It's impossible to predict where Facebook and other major sites will be in five years. Will they be largely extinct? Will they be more akin to Netflix, or like TV channels we can group-comment on? Will they have fixed their problems and be thriving? Just a couple of years ago, many people believed Twitter was dead, and then Donald Trump came along and made it his 24-hour mouthpiece and therefore once again relevant. Facebook could go in this direction, saved by its nascent foray into filmic content, or the mass adoption of virtual reality. Or it could be split up into half a dozen pieces.</p><p>But one thing is certain. For years, Zuckerberg and Facebook have tromped through the technology landscape and demolished everything that stood in their way. As my friend learned the hard way, this was done without any reprisal, and without any consequence. In fact, each time Facebook destroyed a competitor, or found a way around traditional regulatory concerns, its valuation would go up. But now it seems that all of those actions are coming back to haunt the company, and social media as a whole. Facebook was always famous for the sign that hung in its offices, written in big red type on a white background, that said, MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS. But every time I think about the company now, I realize it has done just that to itself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VNFAIR-07338899_VF_0318_23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNFAIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S35-HPX1-JCDS-V2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266942</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vanity Fair</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33408\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0733-8899</issn><volume>Vol. 60</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But we have now reached over 1,600 and we're growing so fast that it's filling up. So we've taken space for another 800 desks in a new building in East Wall with growth over the next few years in mind.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A workforce of 2,800 people would place Facebook among a handful of mega-employers between Dublin's two canals. Throw Google's 6,000 workers into the mix and a new picture of Dublin emerges, where a growing percentage of the city's entire private sector workforce clocks into one or other of the two firms.</p><p>Facebook's expansion will also help to allay one of industrial Ireland's most vocal anxieties: that President Donald Trump's high-octane industrial nationalism might freeze investment projects by US multinationals in this country.</p><p>\"It certainly has had no impact on our investment decisions for now, as evidenced by everything we're doing around our buildings and acquisitions,\" says Lambe. \"We're a global company and we need to service our regions within those regions and languages and with knowledge of the cultural norms. You know, you can't do a lot of what we need to do from the US midwest.\"</p><p>Officially, Lambe has two jobs in Facebook. One is as country lead, making local decisions about staff, buildings, HR and communications. His other role is running the company's sales planning and operations for Europe, Africa and the Asian Pacific regions.</p><p>\"That basically means forecasting our revenues, setting our quotas, organising our sales teams, choosing what industries or verticals to go after and where we open new offices,\" he says. \"So it's a little bit of a chief operating officer role to the regional leadership position. I've teams all around the world to support me on it.\"</p><p>In this role, Lambe is well placed to figure out how and why the Irish operation's presence in Facebook is getting bigger.</p><p>\"It's no longer just Facebook,\" he says.</p><p>\"It's now also WhatsApp and Instagram and Messenger. WhatsApp has 1.2bn users. Messenger has over a billion users while Instagram has 600m. We've monetised Instagram and our business is growing pretty dramatically. Our last earnings showed growth of over 50pc year on year. When you're growing users and business as fast as that, we [in Ireland] need to scale up. We've been very successful here in Ireland at delivering results for Facebook. So we continue to get investment.\"</p><p>Facebook's main source of income is advertising. In this, its growth is staggering: it now hoovers up somewhere between 15pc to 25pc of all the world's online ads. (Google is the only bigger company, with over a third of the entire market.) Its ads are successful because of the time people spend on Facebook. In Ireland alone, some two-thirds of adults have a Facebook account with more than half checking it every single day. Globally, it's a similar story. Facebook has an astonishing 1.8bn users - one-in-four of all the men, women and children on earth. They're spending longer every day on the service and using it for more diverse purposes.</p><p>With such scale comes great power.</p><p>Facebook has become the de facto news delivery service of the world. Twitter may dominate breaking news headlines, but it is Facebook that boasts unprecedented depth and reach, used by virtually every major news organisation as its main secondary platform to target audiences.</p><p>This hasn't been without its difficulties. Facebook's position as the online resource most checked has led to increasing calls for it to be acknowledged - and perhaps even regulated -as a media company. Alongside this are similar demands for Facebook to do something about what critics call its 'fake news' problem, where made-up news reports are given some of the same algorithmic boosts as legitimate, properly sourced news articles. This became an especially charged issue during the recent US presidential election, when a number of made-up news stories achieved wide circulation on Facebook, with headlines such as 'Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump'.</p><p>Dealing with fake news is not Gareth Lambe's day job. But the Ireland boss still doesn't believe that the 'media company' tag levelled at it is a proportionate one. He also says that Facebook is trying in earnest to deal with the proliferation of 'fake news'.</p><p>\"We don't consider ourselves to be a media company,\" he says. \"We consider ourselves to be a technology company. But we do acknowledge our responsibilities in that [media] space. Take fake news, for example. I think that term encompasses a lot of things. At one end of it is hoaxes, the part that's easiest for us to address. That often relates to the second part of fake news, which is financial scams where people use clickbait to bring you into ad farms and manipulate you. We're really aggressively going after that. But the third part of what people are calling fake news is not necessarily a question of something being fake or true, but of something just being incredibly charged or biased. And whether that's fake or true depends on the receiver. We do not intend to be the arbiter of that truth and I don't think anyone else wants us to be.</p><p>\"So one way we're tackling this is by having our users decide. We've introduced a new product in the US, Germany and France where, if an article is disputed by enough users, it goes to a third party fact-checker. And if they deem it to be on the wrong side of fake versus true, it's flagged as such. We don't remove it, but it's flagged as disputed and so people can click on the link that explains why they it's flagged as disputed. So that's a real users-up mechanism way to try and reduce fake news rather than us saying 'that's false or that's true'.\"</p><p>Lambe also points to digital literacy projects being undertaken by Facebook to try to increase awareness of online standards and processes.</p><p>\"We have acknowledged that there are issues there,\" he says. \"We're focused on the worst of the worst. The other parts, which are disputable, are hard - and it's not just Facebook's accountability. It's also the job of industry, the internet and the media to help get that right.</p><p>\"We think there's a digital literacy job to be done, which is what we're working closely with the journalism profession to do.\"</p><p>Despite such protestations about not being a media firm, Facebook is forging ahead with media partnerships that bring it closer in form and function to many current media companies. Last week, it signed a deal to broadcast 22 Major League Soccer (MLS) matches live in the US. It also has eyes on commissioning or broadcasting original content of its own in future.</p><p>Again, though, this is not inconsistent with Facebook remaining a tech company says Lambe.</p><p>\"We consider ourselves very much as a tech company,\" he says. \"But we understand that we have a large role in the media space because so much content is provided on Facebook. One of the biggest developments for us here is video. Video is exploding on the internet and on Facebook, in particular. What we've done is a deal for 22 MLS games but it's a mobile-first product, so it's going to have tighter video angles.</p><p>\"We're experimenting with ad breaks during live video but overall it's about collaborating and extending their reach and, for us, harnessing the power of video and content. Sports is inherently social.\"</p><p>Facebook's Dublin headquarters - which serves parts of Asia as well as all of Europe and Africa - does a few main things. It has a huge safety and policy section, looking after things such as abusive content and bullying. It also has a massive sales staff, dealing with ads and campaigns for small firms and big corporates. And there is a sizeable engineering and data centre cohort located here.</p><p>None of the new features we see rolled out on our phones - such as Instagram Stories or Messenger Day - are coded from Dublin. But the Irish operation feeds into almost everything else.</p><p>\"We now have over 50 functions here,\" says Lambe. \"It's by far our largest footprint in any country outside our Silicon Valley headquarters. If the business and platform continue to grow, we expect to continue to grow pretty substantially in Ireland.\"</p><p>The new Facebook building, which won't be ready for a year, is close to Dublin's Point Depot on the northside docklands. Big tech companies are notorious for turning down northside city locations. But Lambe sees a different future for Dublin 1. \"I think us moving there is a statement for the area,\" he says. \"We see this area as having a lot of potential, a lot like the current area [Facebook's current home in the Grand Canal basin] 10 or 15 years ago. We considered places with lower costs on the outskirts of Dublin. But because we'll be moving some people from this building to the new one, we wanted to keep disruption to a minimum.\"</p><p>These days, planning for the capacity to add an extra 1,000 jobs comes with certain challenges. Where to live is close to the top of such challenges. Dublin is currently undergoing a housing crunch, with soaring rents a symptom of a chronic lack of supply.</p><p>\"It would be a concern for the future, both in the affordability and the availability,\" says Lambe. \"In five years time, will we have the infrastructure to accommodate future growth? That said, it hasn't been an issue to date in that we've managed to scale effectively here. We were 30 people in 2009 and now we're 1,600 with plans for expansion. But it's certainly something we're watching for the future.\"</p><p>The new building will take close to a year to fit out. By the time, company founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will have just about finished his 50-state tour of the US.</p><p>Might he drop in to Dublin? \"Yeah, I expect him to come by in the next year or so,\" says Lambe. \"He was here a few years ago but hasn't been in a while. We have a lot of very senior people like Sheryl Sandberg coming all the time. David Fisher, who runs our sales and marketing function, is over here regularly as is Jay Parikh [vice-president of infrastructure engineering] who has an engineering team here.</p><p>\"Mark is a busy guy and tends to focus his travel on initiatives that only he can have the impact on, like <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Internet.org\">www.Internet.org</url>.

Wood, who no longer has Indian private banks in his Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio for the first time since its inception, said he is less negative on banks after the Reserve Bank of India decided not to extend the loan moratorium. Edited excerpts:The coronavirus risk continues, but the markets seem unperturbed. How do you read the situation?</p><p>All markets including India are influenced by the US market, and the US market has continued to rally... For India, my understanding is the net recovery rates are improving. While the case load continues to rise, the reality is that the death rate in India is very low. The market is probably taking the view that the worst has been seen in India... In terms of domestic activity, most things are not locked down anymore. The key, most positive thing that has happened in India since Covid-19 started is that the government ended this lockdown. The lockdown was very negative for the Indian economy.Is the market rally a bear market rally or a sustainable one? Do you see the Indian market hitting record highs soon?I would stay invested in India. There are better markets to invest in but in my view, the market will not go back to the lows of March. The other positive thing that has happened is that the government has not extended the moratorium. The RBI has announced a restructuring process. That is more positive. I was worried they were going to extend the moratorium to the end of the year. I am less negative on banks as opposed to positive on Indian banks.You don't have Indian banks in your Asia ex-Japan portfolio anymore.It has happened for the first time since 2002 when I started my Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio that I do not have an Indian private sector bank in it. The reason for that is there is a risk. We already had this risk because of the NBFC crisis and the dramatic slowdown in growth in India. We had this dramatic slowdown in growth in India even before Covid-19. My concern is we may get a big increase in consumer NPLs. That's why I don't have any Indian banks in my portfolio... If I am wrong and there is not going to be a consumer NPL cycle in India, then you should buy the Indian banks.What is your outlook on gold prices? There are mixed views on whether the rally will sustain.I am long term very bullish on gold because I believe US real interest rates will remain very low. In the short term, gold can correct a bit more. The worst case for gold is a correction back to 1,750 level. One thing about India is in the last several years, you had positive real rates in India.HDFC Bank will soon have a new CEO. What is your outlook on the bank?It is good that they have made an internal appointment. The previous CEO did such a fantastic job. It is a bit like replacing the manager of a very successful football team, it is not easy. Right now, HDFC Bank has the lowest percentage of loans in moratorium... It would make me more nervous if they had made an external appointment.What is your reading of the economic data coming out of India?We have seen the worst. I am hoping the second quarter was the bottom. The data suggests that the economy is 80% back to normal.Where does India stand within your preference list for EMs?I am a bit overweight on India, but I was much more overweight two years ago. I raised the weighting a little bit when they announced the bank restructuring but my biggest overweight in the Asian portfolio remain China and Taiwan.How will the market react to a Trump victory or a Biden victory?It is very hard for Donald Trump to win the election unless the cases and deaths because of the virus decline significantly by, let's say, the end of September... If the election was held today, then the Democratic Party would win, and they would probably take control of the Senate. In the stock market that would be good for everything to do with alternative energy because the Democrats want to do a $2 trillion Green New Deal... In the market there would be concern that the Democrat administration will want to regulate and tax more aggressively Big Tech.

Jon, let's talk about it, what is meant to be the most efficient discounting machine on the planet has suddenly woken up and realized some tax cuts are coming.  Am I really meant to believe that's what's happening?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well what happened was up until probably the very last minute, everyone was focused on are we going to get something, what's going to be in it, what's it going to look like?  </p><p>      And all of a sudden now the question is, what does it mean for every single company separately and there's this massive readjustment on asset values that's happening.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So what does it mean?  What's the kind of research you've been doing in the last couple of weeks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well what you're seeing is is that the market is making a very crude initial attempt to figure out who are the very big winners which would be companies that are mostly domestically oriented like banks and transports and retailers, and companies that are more global in nature that are able to kind of lower their tax rate or shield it abroad like tech companies.  </p><p>      And it's literally just rotating from those companies like tech into some of those other natures.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  It all looked calm yesterday on the S&amp;P500, it must have missed its rotation that was taking place beneath it.  And Steve, we can take a look at the chart, the (INAUDIBLE) courtesy of Goldman Sachs.  </p><p>      The high tax stocks and the low tax stocks and it's a pivot away from low tax and a pivot towards high tax.  It's starting to pick up. Does this have similar longevity Steve?  Some room to run?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  We do.  We think so Jonathan.  We've been -- our last equities back in September we added to small CAP value stocks probably because we thought the tax bill would be going through.  </p><p>      The market has been a rotational market for the last 18 months and people forget that financials had a big run right after the president was elected.  Then we took a rest, techs led.  I think it's very naturally the tech stocks are a little stretched. </p><p>      We still like them here.  Google and Facebook are trading at 21 times in next year's earnings in these numbers.  So I didn't think this correction will last forever on the tech but certainly the big beneficiaries of the tax bill if you factor in the better growth, the steeper yield curve that we think we get, and certainly lower taxes, really financials, the cyclicals, so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Steve, something I'm trying to get my head around is whether this is a switch from low tax to high tax or high tax to low tax or from growth to value.  Is it the former or the latter or is it a mixed of these two things?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I think there's a few trends going on here but certainly our view is there is going to be a shift to value at least the first half of next year.    </p><p>      You're going to have -- the economy has put in two, three percent in quarters, people have thought that it couldn't happen, we've heard that all year long, people have the wrong framework.  Now we have a three percent quarter in Q4 and the tax bill, just listening to the commentary Jonathan, people just have the wrong framework on this tax bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Well how does this working out then?  What are they doing wrong?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  It's this Keynesian idea we've had 30 years of nothing but Keynesian economics in tax bill.  So the way we analyze tax bills is, we go around and we try to figure out how many dollars each person got, we added it all up, and we say that's the stimulus for the next three weeks and we go back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So what should we be doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  This is a supply-driven tax bill.  It's improving the long-term after tax returns on investment.  It is going to change the productivity profile of the economy and it should overtime improve corporate investment because the after tax returns on investment have just gone up.  </p><p>      So we see this as it's not about how much stimulus we get next year from a dollar's perspective, maybe from a confidence perspective, and maybe from an investment perspective.  I think people just have the wrong framework on this bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Do you believe Jonathan Golub that we move away from capital returns and move towards capital spending and that's fueled by this tax bill?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  You know, it's -- Steve and I have had this conversation and in all honesty, Steve was right, I didn't think the thing was good policy, I still question that.  I didn't think it would get through and if it was, it's quickly and Steve was right.  And that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Yes.  Was it pulled back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  On the other --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I was pulling back to your third line of defense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  On the other hand, do I think that the big win here is that on average, company's EPS was going to adjust something like 10 percent whenever this hits, whether it's in 2018 or in 2019.  </p><p>      Yes.  So I think that that will dwarf the economic impact of 20 or 30 or 40 basis points, whatever the economic growth, I do.  And companies have been able borrow at really low cost of capital and have not done infrastructure spending when capital was relatively free.  </p><p>      So I'm a little bit skeptical, not that there won't be any response but that is going to be a big overwhelming response.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Right.  The 150 in earnings, I think that's where you're heading for next year, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well -- I mean consensus is right, if this hit in 2018 and we don't think it will but we have $146 as a consensus view, that goes to about --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  But $150 --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Because of that $160.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  OK.  And so -- now -- but it's not --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  But this is the owe it moment for much of Wall Street right now all year long.  And we've done this on this show Jonathan, people have been fighting about -- they just assume it's a fact the market is expensive.  </p><p>      It's just been assumed fact.  They're looking at the valuation on the market relative to a recession earnings number in 2016, earnings recession, 115.  And the owe it moment is we're here three weeks from the end of the year and we're talking about, is the earnings number for next year $150 or $160?  That's 16 to 17 time multiple on a market that we were told is trading mid 20s.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So we're trading at 18 times forward --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  But there is a different story --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Exactly.  Well this market (INAUDIBLE) cheap but the market is not expensive and everyone that's been telling their client said it is is literally now trying to back away from this position gently.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Yes.  And what you also know is I've been quite bullish on the market and I don't think the market has been --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  You've been dead writing on the market Jonathan just so you -- </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Right.  You're throwing me --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  We can do something, I appreciate that.  I'm -- and you've been consistently bullish on the market largely on your earnings (INAUDIBLE) which have been good.  But my point is you're now upgrading it to $150, $160, you got to be --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Yes.  Or when -- and you have to wait for the exact details to come up.  But if something, it has to move on that.  So the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up.  </p><p>      And that the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up, let's just say 10 percent, I don't know what the number is.  Does the market say, I give you 10 percent extra price?  Does it say, it's a lower quality benefit because it's taxes and it give you 5?    </p><p>      Is Steve Auth right?  And you say, you get that plus the potential for more efficiency and you get 15?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Right.  And that's the opportunity, that's the debate now because that bears on the thing happening, they're falling back to, \"Oh, this is a kind of short-term stimulus, long-term,\" no difference.  </p><p>      Where we're different at Federated is we believe this actually makes the economy more productive in a higher growth trajectory over the next three to five years.  And on that basis, it's not just the one auth hit to earnings but it puts us on a more stable platform.  </p><p>      It keeps the Fed at bay because of the productivity impacting inflation and you've got a pretty healthy environment for stocks.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Is the Fed (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  We're talking value stocks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well I don't think there's a bear case on this.  I think the question is, is this bullish for the market or is this really, really bullish for the market?  And I'm kind of -- and so the question is, does this set off another wave of spending?  </p><p>      Does this ultimately -- I mean, what we know is this will increase deficits.  I mean, that's -- there's always the commerce that's telling you that this is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  They're telling you -- you know it's going to increase deficits.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well this engage the Fed to be a little bit more aggressive because the labor market's already tied and it squeezes.  </p><p>      I mean, when I look at market behavior, the most important thing is that the recovery just keeps going.  If this shortens the recovery by pulling the Fed even six months earlier, that may undo some of the benefit here. </p><p>      And that's perhaps where you and I are -- there's no question on the basic math.  The question is, second order effect, not going to affect the --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Productivity in the longer term growth impact.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  I'm skeptical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  And you know what, I rather be skeptical and be right later.  But --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  You know why Steve feels so good?  He's been right for the most of the last 12 months.  Look at him he's smiling at your end.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  There are times when I'm wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes, right.  Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse sticking with us.  Steve Auth of federated staying with us as well.    </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Steve Auth.  Steve, are you comfortable?  Still bullish going into next year if the Deutsche Bank will prove correct for hikes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Oh no, they're right.  I would be much more cautious on the market, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  You would think?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Yes.  But I don't think they're right.  But --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Why don't you think they're right?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I think they have the wrong framework again.  The Fed -- first of all, you can't say this bill is at one hand not going to stimulate that much and then turn around later and say it's going to cost the Fed to panic.  So in the near-term, there isn't a lot of extra spending unleashed by the bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Is four hikes a panic?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Four hikes is a lot more than the market expects.  At Federated we're thinking we get December, we get maybe one or two hikes next year and the primary way of the Fed tightening from here is QT, reversing QE basically.  </p><p>      And maybe they accelerate that path which actually would steepen the yield curve which, again, would be good for the financial.  So this is a little contrarian to where the market is.  A market is into this idea that the yield curve is going to continue to flatten.  And, yes, I think that's bad for the equity market, and Brett's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So let's play this out, Brett's on the phone, Brett gets you call he says four next year, what would you say back to him?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I say, Brett, I disagree with you, I just don't see it. What Brett is depending on I believe and I would ask him, \"Brett, what are you depending on?\"  And he would say he's depending on inflation picking up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Are you dependent on that Brett?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  That is one of the key (INAUDIBLE) I mean the Fed's credibility is, of course, with an inflation.  I would say listen, these are valid points and one thing I would say is that we've been in this sort of market where they're reluctant to press much beyond the next six months in this environment.  </p><p>      And I don't exactly know why.  I don't think that that's going to change its balance sheet policy but I think there's a valid point about the steeping of the curve as we get more details out of the ECD and potentially some action further down the line with the BOJ.  So there are certainly risks and very valid points, understood.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  In order to get four next year, the Fed needs to move market participants along that path which means they need to basically start screaming fire right now that we have an inflation problem. It doesn't mean that if you --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Pretty difficult to scream fire when there's hardly any smoke.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  There's no inflation problem.  We've got all these deflationary forces out there --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  And so I'm say, to get from here to four that means they have to start basically getting the market convinced that this is happening right away.  Which means they are going to -- they're going to knowingly smash the yield curve and assume that equity investors aren't going to -- you look at that as a sign to panic.  </p><p>      And I think that they're going to drive the -- if they do what's being laid out here, they are knowingly telling the equity market that it's -- that the party is over and I just don't think the Fed would do that unless you have a real steepening of the yield curve and really truly visible inflation which may happen.  But until we actually see that, I think that this kind of call is -- would be startling.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Well in fairness, let's give the final word to Brett Ryan.  Brett, is there going to be a communication problems to achieve the kind of hikes at a kind of velocity that you think they're going to be up to deliver the map?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Well -- I mean, let's look what happened over the past year, the market had nothing prices in for dealing of this year (INAUDIBLE) three times and surprise the market a bit and stock markets have gone up.  </p><p>      I think the last I've said is that even like what the Fed's framework is, they see neutral to eight and they don't see this as a necessarily tightening stance in a sense that it's pushing back against growth.  </p><p>      They see this as being a prudent move to get to neutral.  And to your point about the stock market, they're looking at financial conditions and they're obviously factoring in the fact that financial conditions continue to ease even though they keep tightening.  </p><p>      And it's starting to at least bother them a little bit and make them a little concern.  So maybe it's less about the inflation picture and more about financial stability which they're taking into account.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  All right Brett, really appreciate your time sir to join us.  Brett Ryan of Deutche Bank, thank you.  Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse and Steve Auth of Federated will be sticking with us up.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Mark Yusko joining the team around the table in New York, Morgan Creek Capital Founder and CIO.  Mark, 400k, I think it's fair to say the experts on Bitcoin and not on Wall Street, they're elsewhere because pretty much everyone I've spoken to so far says the following.  </p><p>      Don't know anything about it but think there's some value in block chain and that's kind of where the conversation begins and ends. For you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Well but the problem is Bitcoin is a block chain, right? It is a block chain.  So it is a form of this revolutionary disruptive technology.  </p><p>      And look, all the bank, people that you showed, they should be deathly afraid of this.  This displaces -- this has the potential to displace the need for banks as a trust institution.  If you and I exchange currency or CAP commerce using Bitcoin and it goes on the ledger on the block chain, we don't need a bank to confirm that that is a valid transaction.  So it has the potential to disrupt banking as we know it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  How do we get to 400l?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  So 400k is very simple, it's just math, right?  It is gold equivalence.  So there are 21 million Bitcoin total.  No, actually it won't be 21 million because a few have been destroyed.  So call it 20 million-ish.  </p><p>      So 20 million in gold today is about eight trillion, it gives you 400k.  Now that doesn't include any use cases like currency.  Like if you and I want to exchange a medium of currency, I'm just talking about gold equivalence.  </p><p>      And the reason that's so interesting for a gold equivalent is think about gold, all of it in the world fits into an Olympic-size swimming pool.  It's very heavy, if I have a bar, it's really hard for me to give everybody a piece.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  I can't even afford a single piece of Bitcoin, never mind a bar of gold, we're not even there yet.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek is going to be sticking with us.    </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Around the table with me to strip back this open is Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  Mark, is this still the most hated bull market ever?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  I think that is such a ridiculous state.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Will you tell me why because --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Cash --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Wait, wait, wait, we're at record highs and no one comes on this program saying that the market is cheap, they say it's expensive.  No one sits here and says this is going to last longer and say we remain defensive and then we keep grinding up to all time high. It doesn't feel (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Well that's because the quality -- the host attracts quality client (INAUDIBLE) you have smart people who come on the show. And intelligent person has to look at the market and say it's expensive, you have to do that.  </p><p>      It doesn't mean it can't get more expensive but you can't say it's cheap.  There's no definition on the planet except denominated in gold.  Actually denominated in gold were lower than 2000 or lower than 2007.    </p><p>      But in dollars you can't say it's cheap.  But what you can say is that we are in a period where there's bullions and their speculative fervor towards stocks but you can't say it's cheap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  It still feels unloved to me Steve.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Oh, it's completely unloved.  It's been an unloved rally all the way up.  That's what creates 20-year bull markets which is what we're in.    </p><p>      We came off 2008, 2009, everybody in the game believes we got a 40 percent down draft around the corner and that's what get people relatively light in equities, that's what kept flows out of equity funds.  It's why people say it's expensive even though it isn't, you got one year --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Wait a second, how do you say there are people on investment?  We have the highest waiting -- the individual investor has the highest waiting in equities in history, we have the lowest cash holdings in mutual funds since 2000.  How do you say it's unloved?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  First of all, it is unloved based on how -- what allocations are to equities unless where you're getting numbers from. And I don't know what kind of flows you're looking at but flows in equities over the last five or six years have been basically constantly selling net sales of equity funds.  </p><p>      Jonathan and I were just at a dinner last night with a bunch of investors, very typical, the kind of things I see, people are cautious.  They've been cautious all the way up because they think even if they acknowledge that, \"OK, maybe we get another pop here\" and then it's going to heck in a hand basket to use an old expression.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  And it's that fear that keeps the markets at a reasonable level.  The goldilocks situation we have around us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Jon, you want to weigh in?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  You know, markets don't move up because of sentiment because you like it and he doesn't.  They move up because -- I mean there's really two things that matter, is the economic expansion going to continue for the next year or two or longer?  Yes.  </p><p>      Our company's generating positive cash flows and I'll take a swipe but at the -- relative to Bitcoin which it doesn't create cash flows but nonetheless, do as big companies spit off a boatload of cash.    </p><p>      Yes, if you look in the last 10 years while the economy has been weaker, companies have generated twice the cash flow for dollar or sales than they have historically.  That directly translates into what you call expensive but I would call is justifiable above average valuations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So about three, four minutes into the open guys, I just want to get up to the -- up the scores on the screen.  </p><p>      Jon, you think this has got legs, don't you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Every single stock has to be revalued right now because there's a new tax rate that gets applied to their earnings.  We know that tech is a low tax rate sector, we know that you're talking about an alternative, minimum tax for corporations which is going to make it a little expensive.  </p><p>      And so there's an adjustment going on until the market thinks that they're done in getting everything to fair value which we're probably 60 percent through or something.  We're going to see rotation.  </p><p>      People are not selling or buying the market, they're simply trying to realign their portfolios in order to figure out what fair value is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  What are your thoughts on tech Mark because it can't just be about technology and tax pure and simple?  These are the companies that generate tremendous earnings growth, revenue growth for 2017 as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  And actually what's happening this week really has nothing to do with taxes and has nothing to do with tech selling.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Tell us what's going on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  It's a big hedge fund unwinding with big leverage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  What's the source for that?  What are you looking at?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  We talked -- we do a lot of work with a lot of hedge funds and there's a big hedge fund that I won't name to protect the innocent.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  But they're having to unwind a very large tech book, they run a lot of leverage.  And there are these platform funds out there and they use a lot of managers and they all individual mangers run market neutral.  Equal dollar, long dollar short, then the fund puts big leverage on top of it.    </p><p>      Five, six, eight, ten times leverage.  When that turns and they got caught, OK, long tech and short the consumer and the media names and that's going the wrong way.  So they're losing on both sides, they have to de-risk and --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  But their pain is our gain.  I mean we've got the S&amp;P at 3,000 for next year and what I like about it is you can certainly look at the financials.  Take at J.P. Morgan, it's trading, it's got maybe $10.00 in earnings next year with this tax bill, it's trading at $1.06.  </p><p>      That is not expensive, that's like an 11 multiple.  Yet in this correction, Facebook today is trading I think at 20 times next year as earnings.  These are big growth companies.  I do think that tech --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Well Facebook is (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Exactly.  But, OK, it's currently pushed these big tech stocks a little lower, technical reasons, they unwind.  I think it's going to end up being a great opportunity.  I mean, we've been buying the financials all year.  </p><p>      But I think -- and longer time but I would see a great opportunity here setting up to add to these big tech positions.  These are winners in the global --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  I was only talking about this week.  I'm not talking about a big trend.  The challenge we have is earnings and PE multiples, right?  If you look earnings today or where they were on an as reported basis, not this earnings before bad stuff pro forma garbage.  </p><p>      But the actual earnings of the S&amp;P are the same as they were five years ago yet the market is 80 percent higher, that's all multiples --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well wait, that's not a fair share.  First of all, you had oil prices adjust massively.  If you take out the earnings in the energy sector, the earnings have --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Yes, so that's what I'm trying --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  But, of course, but as soon as take out --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Look, in 2010 the S&amp;P earnings are $60.00, today we're talking about $150.  It's been almost a three bagger.  Two-thirds of the run up in the S&amp;P and everyone here has said it's not going to happen as --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  I'm not talking about --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  Two-thirds of a runoff off of -- run up off of 2009 has been actually --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  I'm not talking about 2009 to 2012.  I'm talking about the last five years, 2012 to 2017, the earnings --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  But your starting point is a peak dollar a price of oil.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  But over four years when you did well at the bottom and --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Oil peaked 2014.  Oil peaked at 2014.  I'm talking about since 2012 to 2017, oil prices are lower certainly but you can't take out one sector.  That's like saying, I would be six foot four if I had former --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  That's what makes the market.  It could have people that are --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  I want to take out one (INAUDIBLE) Gerard Cassidy, obviously Capital Markets Managing Director on his rotation into the financial.  Gerard, for a lot of people out there that have seen this run out (INAUDIBLE) in the last couple weeks and say, \"Am I too late?\" What do you say back to them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  I would say no.  When we look at the banks we are still seeing expectations for a higher interest rates and the higher interest rates will lead to better profitability for the sector.  </p><p>      And the tax rate cuts are obviously important but the bigger impact for the banks is the expected growth that's coming from tax reform and that will lead to stronger loan growth on top of higher interest rates.  So you're still going to --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Gerard, the pushback -- the pushback sir is that the demand might not be there on the consumer and the business side but the loan growth might be available, the supply might be ther ready to go but no one wants to borrow.  Do you see that changing because at the moment in the data, it looks a little softer?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  You're right.  The data certainly is specifically in commercial lending but when you look at commercial real estate and you look at the consumer side, we're seeing mid single digital growth.    </p><p>      So if real GDP is going to accelerate next year, that should drive commercial loan growth stronger than it is today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Mark Yusko?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  But Gerard, how does GDP accelerate next year?  One thing we know is that deficits and debt actually crowd out and lower economic growth.  So it's likely the economic growth goes lower.  </p><p>      GDP -- nominal GDP growth is equal to working in population growth plus productivity, both of which are sub one percent.  So I don't know how we get this big boom in economic growth and the CNI data says that loans are softening, credit card delinquencies are rising?  </p><p>      Loan payment -- student loan delinquencies are over one-third today, how is that positive for banks?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  I would say first on the student loan side, that's us as taxpayers, the banks have nothing to do with the student lending, that's all U.S. government.  So for the banks, that's an issue.    </p><p>      But delinquencies on credit cards, you got to remember we were at all time record lows two years ago and we're still at unusually low level.  So the credit card delinquencies doesn't -- don't really concern us unless unemployment starts to rise.  </p><p>      But when you look at the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, both of those time periods within four quarters of the tax cuts, the economy in those time periods accelerated and, of course, in the Reagan cuts, you remember all the deficits and the concerns about deficits crowding out borrowers and it didn't happen and it doesn't appear to be (INAUDIBLE) today.  </p><p>      So as more people have money to spend as well as corporate, traditionally, again, using the history as a guide, we would suggest we're going to see an accelerated GDP number when this kicks in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Jonathan Golub, before we lose you, Deutsche Bank was on this program 20 minutes ago talking about four rate hikes.  We were talking about anticipating a flatter yield curve.  What does that mean for financials four rate hike next year, the potential for even flatter yield curve?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  If you have four rate hikes that means you have an environment where growth is much stronger and the longer yield curve is coming out.  So what -- I don't know what this means to Gerard.  </p><p>      But the conditions that you would have for rate hikes would probably mean that we got much more economic flow through the tax plan.  The yield curve is ripping at the long end of the curve and the market may be looking at this thing thinking, \"Gosh, things are almost too good.\"  </p><p>      But the Fed's not doing four rate hikes next year unless conditions are that good.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  You agree? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I agree completely.  (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Steve Auth of Federated, great to have you with us. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, thank you.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  And to you, of course, Gerard Cassidy joining us on a telephone, thank you very much sir.    </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Mark Yusko, when you think about media, are you thinking more about tech in the same story?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Not that I agree.  I think it is that merging of TM&amp;T, (INAUDIBLE) communications is all becoming one big conglomerate.    </p><p>      And these vertical integrations and horizontal expansions I think are going to continue to (INAUDIBLE) right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Steve Auth, looking it more broadly we thought we'd get this big high push up in CEO confidence, it's there.  We thought that that would then translate into a more M&amp;A activity.  We haven't seen it.  </p><p>      We also thought that this administration would be a light touch on antitrust, we're learning they probably won't be.  What does this all mean from consolidation and M&amp;A?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I think some of the M&amp;A guidance has been waiting for this tax bill to know the rules they run.  So we expect to see quite a bit of M&amp;A going into next year.  </p><p>      On the media front, look, there's value in these big old media companies for sure.  We keep sniffing around for that reason.  Our problem is we can't quite figure out how this thing gets end up being put together.    </p><p>      There are major cost disadvantage to the big new economy players if you will.  We'd rather for now stick with the guys who are winning game, the Facebooks, the Googles, those guys just have a big margin advantage, asset and cash flow advantage for these traditional media companies to sort that.  </p><p>      I think eventually there's going to be something very interesting here but --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Just a final question to you, do you think there will be some recognition from antitrust and this administration that these guys aren't competing with themselves anymore, they're competing with Amazon, they're competing with Facebook, et cetera, and this sector is a lot, lot bigger than maybe they thought it was?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMOBI</emphasis>:  No question this administration is more inclined to a rollback of media regulations that will provide we think a catalyst.  </p><p>      Now, we're a little confused by the kind of the resistance to the AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal.  If you kind of take that aside, you see that the bag drop for regulation has become more attractive, things like the reinstatement of the (INAUDIBLE) discount which catalyze (INAUDIBLE) merger.  </p><p>      And I might also add in a long period that we've covered this sector, never before have we seen a conflict of ingredient that we think will kind of provide that next wave of M&amp;A where that is kind of the attractive stock price for media companies, the ample cash reserves, financial flexibility.  </p><p>      And then what we call the Amazon and Netflix factor where companies are trying to anticipate what these two companies are going to do and provide kind of defensive motivation for them to go out and try to mitigate the potential threats from these two companies as another potential catalyst for M&amp;A activity.  </p><p>      So I would argue that this is as good a time as we've ever seen in long time that we've covered this phase for more deals to unfold.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Tuna Amobi of CFRA, really appreciate your time this morning sir.  Thank you.  Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek will be sticking with us.    </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Still with us Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  Mark, it must be probably one of the biggest non- stories of this year so far, the changing of the heads at the Federal Reserve because they all look pretty mainstream to me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YUSKO</emphasis>:  Yes.  And we're talking about hawks earlier in the year and we got more dove and I don't see a lot changing.  </p><p>      I do a little bit of variant perception on hikes and I actually don't think the hikes are doing anything to restrict liquidity.  If you look at financial conditions, they are still very, very loose, in fact, the loosest we've had in a couple decades.  </p><p>      I think what they're trying to do is get back to neutral.  See, for a hundred years the Fed fund rate has been equal to nominal GDP which means we really need to be back around three percent.    </p><p>      The problem with getting there is that the yield curve is inverted which probably we need to do a little cleansing but --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Steve, biggest challenge for the F1C next year.  Just quickly, what is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUTH</emphasis>:  I think it's just communicating with the market as we move through here and dealing with maybe a little bit of extra pressure on inflation.  But I think they're in a pretty predictable play out, very few rate hikes, more QT and scale back on the regulation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Gents, I really enjoyed your appearance on the show today.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Steve Auth of Federated. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  That does it for us here on the open about 26 minutes into the session.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 PERCENT ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Jon, let's talk about it, what is meant to be the most efficient discounting machine on the planet has suddenly woken up and realized some tax cuts are coming. Am I really meant to believe that's what's happening?</p><p>JONATHAN GOLUB, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE: Well what happened was up until probably the very last minute, everyone was focused on are we going to get something, what's going to be in it, what's it going to look like?</p><p>And all of a sudden now the question is, what does it mean for every single company separately and there's this massive readjustment on asset values that's happening.</p><p>FERRO: So what does it mean? What's the kind of research you've been doing in the last couple of weeks?</p><p>GOLUB: Well what you're seeing is is that the market is making a very crude initial attempt to figure out who are the very big winners which would be companies that are mostly domestically oriented like banks and transports and retailers, and companies that are more global in nature that are able to kind of lower their tax rate or shield it abroad like tech companies.</p><p>And it's literally just rotating from those companies like tech into some of those other natures.</p><p>FERRO: It all looked calm yesterday on the S&amp;P500, it must have missed its rotation that was taking place beneath it. And Steve, we can take a look at the chart, the (INAUDIBLE) courtesy of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The high tax stocks and the low tax stocks and it's a pivot away from low tax and a pivot towards high tax. It's starting to pick up. Does this have similar longevity Steve? Some room to run?</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CIO OF GLOBAL EQUITY, FEDERATED INVESTORS: We do. We think so Jonathan. We've been -- our last equities back in September we added to small CAP value stocks probably because we thought the tax bill would be going through.</p><p>The market has been a rotational market for the last 18 months and people forget that financials had a big run right after the president was elected. Then we took a rest, techs led. I think it's very naturally the tech stocks are a little stretched.</p><p>We still like them here. Google and Facebook are trading at 21 times in next year's earnings in these numbers. So I didn't think this correction will last forever on the tech but certainly the big beneficiaries of the tax bill if you factor in the better growth, the steeper yield curve that we think we get, and certainly lower taxes, really financials, the cyclicals, so.</p><p>FERRO: Steve, something I'm trying to get my head around is whether this is a switch from low tax to high tax or high tax to low tax or from growth to value. Is it the former or the latter or is it a mixed of these two things?</p><p>AUTH: I think there's a few trends going on here but certainly our view is there is going to be a shift to value at least the first half of next year.</p><p>You're going to have -- the economy has put in two, three percent in quarters, people have thought that it couldn't happen, we've heard that all year long, people have the wrong framework. Now we have a three percent quarter in Q4 and the tax bill, just listening to the commentary Jonathan, people just have the wrong framework on this tax bill.</p><p>FERRO: Well how does this working out then? What are they doing wrong?</p><p>AUTH: It's this Keynesian idea we've had 30 years of nothing but Keynesian economics in tax bill. So the way we analyze tax bills is, we go around and we try to figure out how many dollars each person got, we added it all up, and we say that's the stimulus for the next three weeks and we go back.</p><p>FERRO: So what should we be doing?</p><p>AUTH: This is a supply-driven tax bill. It's improving the long-term after tax returns on investment. It is going to change the productivity profile of the economy and it should overtime improve corporate investment because the after tax returns on investment have just gone up.</p><p>So we see this as it's not about how much stimulus we get next year from a dollar's perspective, maybe from a confidence perspective, and maybe from an investment perspective. I think people just have the wrong framework on this bill.</p><p>FERRO: Do you believe Jonathan Golub that we move away from capital returns and move towards capital spending and that's fueled by this tax bill?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, it's -- Steve and I have had this conversation and in all honesty, Steve was right, I didn't think the thing was good policy, I still question that. I didn't think it would get through and if it was, it's quickly and Steve was right. And that --</p><p>AUTH: Yes. Was it pulled back?</p><p>GOLUB: On the other --</p><p>AUTH: I was pulling back to your third line of defense.</p><p>GOLUB: On the other hand, do I think that the big win here is that on average, company's EPS was going to adjust something like 10 percent whenever this hits, whether it's in 2018 or in 2019.</p><p>Yes. So I think that that will dwarf the economic impact of 20 or 30 or 40 basis points, whatever the economic growth, I do. And companies have been able borrow at really low cost of capital and have not done infrastructure spending when capital was relatively free.</p><p>So I'm a little bit skeptical, not that there won't be any response but that is going to be a big overwhelming response.</p><p>AUTH: Right. The 150 in earnings, I think that's where you're heading for next year, right?</p><p>GOLUB: Well -- I mean consensus is right, if this hit in 2018 and we don't think it will but we have $146 as a consensus view, that goes to about --</p><p>AUTH: But $150 --</p><p>GOLUB: Because of that $160.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: OK. And so -- now -- but it's not --</p><p>AUTH: But this is the owe it moment for much of Wall Street right now all year long. And we've done this on this show Jonathan, people have been fighting about -- they just assume it's a fact the market is expensive.</p><p>It's just been assumed fact. They're looking at the valuation on the market relative to a recession earnings number in 2016, earnings recession, 115. And the owe it moment is we're here three weeks from the end of the year and we're talking about, is the earnings number for next year $150 or $160? That's 16 to 17 time multiple on a market that we were told is trading mid 20s.</p><p>FERRO: So we're trading at 18 times forward --</p><p>GOLUB: But there is a different story --</p><p>AUTH: Exactly. Well this market (INAUDIBLE) cheap but the market is not expensive and everyone that's been telling their client said it is is literally now trying to back away from this position gently.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes. And what you also know is I've been quite bullish on the market and I don't think the market has been --</p><p>AUTH: You've been dead writing on the market Jonathan just so you --</p><p>GOLUB: Right. You're throwing me --</p><p>AUTH: We can do something, I appreciate that. I'm -- and you've been consistently bullish on the market largely on your earnings (INAUDIBLE) which have been good. But my point is you're now upgrading it to $150, $160, you got to be --</p><p>GOLUB: Yes. Or when -- and you have to wait for the exact details to come up. But if something, it has to move on that. So the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up.</p><p>And that the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up, let's just say 10 percent, I don't know what the number is. Does the market say, I give you 10 percent extra price? Does it say, it's a lower quality benefit because it's taxes and it give you 5?</p><p>Is Steve Auth right? And you say, you get that plus the potential for more efficiency and you get 15?</p><p>AUTH: Right. And that's the opportunity, that's the debate now because that bears on the thing happening, they're falling back to, \"Oh, this is a kind of short-term stimulus, long-term,\" no difference.</p><p>Where we're different at Federated is we believe this actually makes the economy more productive in a higher growth trajectory over the next three to five years. And on that basis, it's not just the one auth hit to earnings but it puts us on a more stable platform.</p><p>It keeps the Fed at bay because of the productivity impacting inflation and you've got a pretty healthy environment for stocks.</p><p>GOLUB: Is the Fed (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>AUTH: We're talking value stocks.</p><p>GOLUB: Well I don't think there's a bear case on this. I think the question is, is this bullish for the market or is this really, really bullish for the market? And I'm kind of -- and so the question is, does this set off another wave of spending?</p><p>Does this ultimately -- I mean, what we know is this will increase deficits. I mean, that's -- there's always the commerce that's telling you that this is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO: They're telling you -- you know it's going to increase deficits.</p><p>GOLUB: Well this engage the Fed to be a little bit more aggressive because the labor market's already tied and it squeezes.</p><p>I mean, when I look at market behavior, the most important thing is that the recovery just keeps going. If this shortens the recovery by pulling the Fed even six months earlier, that may undo some of the benefit here.</p><p>And that's perhaps where you and I are -- there's no question on the basic math. The question is, second order effect, not going to affect the --</p><p>AUTH: Productivity in the longer term growth impact.</p><p>GOLUB: I'm skeptical.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: And you know what, I rather be skeptical and be right later. But - -</p><p>FERRO: You know why Steve feels so good? He's been right for the most of the last 12 months. Look at him he's smiling at your end.</p><p>AUTH: There are times when I'm wrong.</p><p>FERRO: Yes, right. Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse sticking with us. Steve Auth of federated staying with us as well.</p><p>FERRO: I want to bring in Steve Auth. Steve, are you comfortable? Still bullish going into next year if the Deutsche Bank will prove correct for hikes?</p><p>AUTH: Oh no, they're right. I would be much more cautious on the market, yes.</p><p>FERRO: You would think?</p><p>AUTH: Yes. But I don't think they're right. But --</p><p>FERRO: Why don't you think they're right?</p><p>AUTH: I think they have the wrong framework again. The Fed -- first of all, you can't say this bill is at one hand not going to stimulate that much and then turn around later and say it's going to cost the Fed to panic. So in the near-term, there isn't a lot of extra spending unleashed by the bill.</p><p>FERRO: Is four hikes a panic?</p><p>AUTH: Four hikes is a lot more than the market expects. At Federated we're thinking we get December, we get maybe one or two hikes next year and the primary way of the Fed tightening from here is QT, reversing QE basically.</p><p>And maybe they accelerate that path which actually would steepen the yield curve which, again, would be good for the financial. So this is a little contrarian to where the market is. A market is into this idea that the yield curve is going to continue to flatten. And, yes, I think that's bad for the equity market, and Brett's right.</p><p>FERRO: So let's play this out, Brett's on the phone, Brett gets you call he says four next year, what would you say back to him?</p><p>AUTH: I say, Brett, I disagree with you, I just don't see it. What Brett is depending on I believe and I would ask him, \"Brett, what are you depending on?\" And he would say he's depending on inflation picking up.</p><p>FERRO: Are you dependent on that Brett?</p><p>BRETT RYAN, U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK: That is one of the key (INAUDIBLE) I mean the Fed's credibility is, of course, with an inflation. I would say listen, these are valid points and one thing I would say is that we've been in this sort of market where they're reluctant to press much beyond the next six months in this environment.</p><p>And I don't exactly know why. I don't think that that's going to change its balance sheet policy but I think there's a valid point about the steeping of the curve as we get more details out of the ECD and potentially some action further down the line with the BOJ. So there are certainly risks and very valid points, understood.</p><p>GOLUB: In order to get four next year, the Fed needs to move market participants along that path which means they need to basically start screaming fire right now that we have an inflation problem. It doesn't mean that if you --</p><p>FERRO: Pretty difficult to scream fire when there's hardly any smoke.</p><p>AUTH: There's no inflation problem. We've got all these deflationary forces out there --</p><p>GOLUB: And so I'm say, to get from here to four that means they have to start basically getting the market convinced that this is happening right away. Which means they are going to -- they're going to knowingly smash the yield curve and assume that equity investors aren't going to -- you look at that as a sign to panic.</p><p>And I think that they're going to drive the -- if they do what's being laid out here, they are knowingly telling the equity market that it's -- that the party is over and I just don't think the Fed would do that unless you have a real steepening of the yield curve and really truly visible inflation which may happen. But until we actually see that, I think that this kind of call is -- would be startling.</p><p>FERRO: Well in fairness, let's give the final word to Brett Ryan. Brett, is there going to be a communication problems to achieve the kind of hikes at a kind of velocity that you think they're going to be up to deliver the map?</p><p>RYAN: Well -- I mean, let's look what happened over the past year, the market had nothing prices in for dealing of this year (INAUDIBLE) three times and surprise the market a bit and stock markets have gone up.</p><p>I think the last I've said is that even like what the Fed's framework is, they see neutral to eight and they don't see this as a necessarily tightening stance in a sense that it's pushing back against growth.</p><p>They see this as being a prudent move to get to neutral. And to your point about the stock market, they're looking at financial conditions and they're obviously factoring in the fact that financial conditions continue to ease even though they keep tightening.</p><p>And it's starting to at least bother them a little bit and make them a little concern. So maybe it's less about the inflation picture and more about financial stability which they're taking into account.</p><p>FERRO: All right Brett, really appreciate your time sir to join us. Brett Ryan of Deutche Bank, thank you. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse and Steve Auth of Federated will be sticking with us up.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko joining the team around the table in New York, Morgan Creek Capital Founder and CIO. Mark, 400k, I think it's fair to say the experts on Bitcoin and not on Wall Street, they're elsewhere because pretty much everyone I've spoken to so far says the following.</p><p>Don't know anything about it but think there's some value in block chain and that's kind of where the conversation begins and ends. For you?</p><p>MARK YUSKO, FOUNDER, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL: Well but the problem is Bitcoin is a block chain, right? It is a block chain. So it is a form of this revolutionary disruptive technology.</p><p>And look, all the bank, people that you showed, they should be deathly afraid of this. This displaces -- this has the potential to displace the need for banks as a trust institution. If you and I exchange currency or CAP commerce using Bitcoin and it goes on the ledger on the block chain, we don't need a bank to confirm that that is a valid transaction. So it has the potential to disrupt banking as we know it.</p><p>FERRO: How do we get to 400l?</p><p>YUSKO: So 400k is very simple, it's just math, right? It is gold equivalence. So there are 21 million Bitcoin total. No, actually it won't be 21 million because a few have been destroyed. So call it 20 million- ish.</p><p>So 20 million in gold today is about eight trillion, it gives you 400k. Now that doesn't include any use cases like currency. Like if you and I want to exchange a medium of currency, I'm just talking about gold equivalence.</p><p>And the reason that's so interesting for a gold equivalent is think about gold, all of it in the world fits into an Olympic-size swimming pool. It's very heavy, if I have a bar, it's really hard for me to give everybody a piece.</p><p>FERRO: I can't even afford a single piece of Bitcoin, never mind a bar of gold, we're not even there yet. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek is going to be sticking with us.</p><p>FERRO: Around the table with me to strip back this open is Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. Mark, is this still the most hated bull market ever?</p><p>YUSKO: I think that is such a ridiculous state.</p><p>FERRO: Will you tell me why because --</p><p>YUSKO: Cash --</p><p>FERRO: Wait, wait, wait, we're at record highs and no one comes on this program saying that the market is cheap, they say it's expensive. No one sits here and says this is going to last longer and say we remain defensive and then we keep grinding up to all time high. It doesn't feel (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>YUSKO: Well that's because the quality -- the host attracts quality client (INAUDIBLE) you have smart people who come on the show. And intelligent person has to look at the market and say it's expensive, you have to do that.</p><p>It doesn't mean it can't get more expensive but you can't say it's cheap. There's no definition on the planet except denominated in gold. Actually denominated in gold were lower than 2000 or lower than 2007.</p><p>But in dollars you can't say it's cheap. But what you can say is that we are in a period where there's bullions and their speculative fervor towards stocks but you can't say it's cheap.</p><p>FERRO: It still feels unloved to me Steve.</p><p>AUTH: Oh, it's completely unloved. It's been an unloved rally all the way up. That's what creates 20-year bull markets which is what we're in.</p><p>We came off 2008, 2009, everybody in the game believes we got a 40 percent down draft around the corner and that's what get people relatively light in equities, that's what kept flows out of equity funds. It's why people say it's expensive even though it isn't, you got one year --</p><p>YUSKO: Wait a second, how do you say there are people on investment? We have the highest waiting -- the individual investor has the highest waiting in equities in history, we have the lowest cash holdings in mutual funds since 2000. How do you say it's unloved?</p><p>AUTH: First of all, it is unloved based on how -- what allocations are to equities unless where you're getting numbers from. And I don't know what kind of flows you're looking at but flows in equities over the last five or six years have been basically constantly selling net sales of equity funds.</p><p>Jonathan and I were just at a dinner last night with a bunch of investors, very typical, the kind of things I see, people are cautious. They've been cautious all the way up because they think even if they acknowledge that, \"OK, maybe we get another pop here\" and then it's going to heck in a hand basket to use an old expression.</p><p>YUSKO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: And it's that fear that keeps the markets at a reasonable level. The goldilocks situation we have around us.</p><p>FERRO: Jon, you want to weigh in?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, markets don't move up because of sentiment because you like it and he doesn't. They move up because -- I mean there's really two things that matter, is the economic expansion going to continue for the next year or two or longer? Yes.</p><p>Our company's generating positive cash flows and I'll take a swipe but at the -- relative to Bitcoin which it doesn't create cash flows but nonetheless, do as big companies spit off a boatload of cash.</p><p>Yes, if you look in the last 10 years while the economy has been weaker, companies have generated twice the cash flow for dollar or sales than they have historically. That directly translates into what you call expensive but I would call is justifiable above average valuations.</p><p>FERRO: So about three, four minutes into the open guys, I just want to get up to the -- up the scores on the screen.</p><p>Jon, you think this has got legs, don't you?</p><p>GOLUB: Every single stock has to be revalued right now because there's a new tax rate that gets applied to their earnings. We know that tech is a low tax rate sector, we know that you're talking about an alternative, minimum tax for corporations which is going to make it a little expensive.</p><p>And so there's an adjustment going on until the market thinks that they're done in getting everything to fair value which we're probably 60 percent through or something. We're going to see rotation.</p><p>People are not selling or buying the market, they're simply trying to realign their portfolios in order to figure out what fair value is.</p><p>FERRO: What are your thoughts on tech Mark because it can't just be about technology and tax pure and simple? These are the companies that generate tremendous earnings growth, revenue growth for 2017 as well.</p><p>YUSKO: And actually what's happening this week really has nothing to do with taxes and has nothing to do with tech selling.</p><p>FERRO: Tell us what's going on?</p><p>YUSKO: It's a big hedge fund unwinding with big leverage.</p><p>FERRO: What's the source for that? What are you looking at?</p><p>YUSKO: We talked -- we do a lot of work with a lot of hedge funds and there's a big hedge fund that I won't name to protect the innocent.</p><p>FERRO: OK.</p><p>YUSKO: But they're having to unwind a very large tech book, they run a lot of leverage. And there are these platform funds out there and they use a lot of managers and they all individual mangers run market neutral. Equal dollar, long dollar short, then the fund puts big leverage on top of it.</p><p>Five, six, eight, ten times leverage. When that turns and they got caught, OK, long tech and short the consumer and the media names and that's going the wrong way. So they're losing on both sides, they have to de-risk and - -</p><p>AUTH: But their pain is our gain. I mean we've got the S&amp;P at 3,000 for next year and what I like about it is you can certainly look at the financials. Take at J.P. Morgan, it's trading, it's got maybe $10.00 in earnings next year with this tax bill, it's trading at $1.06.</p><p>That is not expensive, that's like an 11 multiple. Yet in this correction, Facebook today is trading I think at 20 times next year as earnings. These are big growth companies. I do think that tech --</p><p>YUSKO: Well Facebook is (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent.</p><p>AUTH: Exactly. But, OK, it's currently pushed these big tech stocks a little lower, technical reasons, they unwind. I think it's going to end up being a great opportunity. I mean, we've been buying the financials all year.</p><p>But I think -- and longer time but I would see a great opportunity here setting up to add to these big tech positions. These are winners in the global --</p><p>YUSKO: I was only talking about this week. I'm not talking about a big trend. The challenge we have is earnings and PE multiples, right? If you look earnings today or where they were on an as reported basis, not this earnings before bad stuff pro forma garbage.</p><p>But the actual earnings of the S&amp;P are the same as they were five years ago yet the market is 80 percent higher, that's all multiples --</p><p>GOLUB: Well wait, that's not a fair share. First of all, you had oil prices adjust massively. If you take out the earnings in the energy sector, the earnings have --</p><p>YUSKO: Yes, so that's what I'm trying --</p><p>GOLUB: But, of course, but as soon as take out --</p><p>AUTH: Look, in 2010 the S&amp;P earnings are $60.00, today we're talking about $150. It's been almost a three bagger. Two-thirds of the run up in the S&amp;P and everyone here has said it's not going to happen as --</p><p>YUSKO: I'm not talking about --</p><p>AUTH: Two-thirds of a runoff off of -- run up off of 2009 has been actually --</p><p>YUSKO: I'm not talking about 2009 to 2012. I'm talking about the last five years, 2012 to 2017, the earnings --</p><p>AUTH: But your starting point is a peak dollar a price of oil.</p><p>GOLUB: But over four years when you did well at the bottom and --</p><p>YUSKO: Oil peaked 2014. Oil peaked at 2014. I'm talking about since 2012 to 2017, oil prices are lower certainly but you can't take out one sector. That's like saying, I would be six foot four if I had former --</p><p>AUTH: That's what makes the market. It could have people that are --</p><p>FERRO: I want to take out one (INAUDIBLE) Gerard Cassidy, obviously Capital Markets Managing Director on his rotation into the financial. Gerard, for a lot of people out there that have seen this run out (INAUDIBLE) in the last couple weeks and say, \"Am I too late?\" What do you say back to them?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: I would say no. When we look at the banks we are still seeing expectations for a higher interest rates and the higher interest rates will lead to better profitability for the sector.</p><p>And the tax rate cuts are obviously important but the bigger impact for the banks is the expected growth that's coming from tax reform and that will lead to stronger loan growth on top of higher interest rates. So you're still going to --</p><p>FERRO: Gerard, the pushback -- the pushback sir is that the demand might not be there on the consumer and the business side but the loan growth might be available, the supply might be ther ready to go but no one wants to borrow. Do you see that changing because at the moment in the data, it looks a little softer?</p><p>CASSIDY: You're right. The data certainly is specifically in commercial lending but when you look at commercial real estate and you look at the consumer side, we're seeing mid single digital growth.</p><p>So if real GDP is going to accelerate next year, that should drive commercial loan growth stronger than it is today.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko?</p><p>YUSKO: But Gerard, how does GDP accelerate next year? One thing we know is that deficits and debt actually crowd out and lower economic growth. So it's likely the economic growth goes lower.</p><p>GDP -- nominal GDP growth is equal to working in population growth plus productivity, both of which are sub one percent. So I don't know how we get this big boom in economic growth and the CNI data says that loans are softening, credit card delinquencies are rising?</p><p>Loan payment -- student loan delinquencies are over one-third today, how is that positive for banks?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say first on the student loan side, that's us as taxpayers, the banks have nothing to do with the student lending, that's all U.S. government. So for the banks, that's an issue.</p><p>But delinquencies on credit cards, you got to remember we were at all time record lows two years ago and we're still at unusually low level. So the credit card delinquencies doesn't -- don't really concern us unless unemployment starts to rise.</p><p>But when you look at the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, both of those time periods within four quarters of the tax cuts, the economy in those time periods accelerated and, of course, in the Reagan cuts, you remember all the deficits and the concerns about deficits crowding out borrowers and it didn't happen and it doesn't appear to be (INAUDIBLE) today.</p><p>So as more people have money to spend as well as corporate, traditionally, again, using the history as a guide, we would suggest we're going to see an accelerated GDP number when this kicks in.</p><p>FERRO: Jonathan Golub, before we lose you, Deutsche Bank was on this program 20 minutes ago talking about four rate hikes. We were talking about anticipating a flatter yield curve. What does that mean for financials four rate hike next year, the potential for even flatter yield curve?</p><p>GOLUB: If you have four rate hikes that means you have an environment where growth is much stronger and the longer yield curve is coming out. So what -- I don't know what this means to Gerard.</p><p>But the conditions that you would have for rate hikes would probably mean that we got much more economic flow through the tax plan. The yield curve is ripping at the long end of the curve and the market may be looking at this thing thinking, \"Gosh, things are almost too good.\"</p><p>But the Fed's not doing four rate hikes next year unless conditions are that good.</p><p>FERRO: Yes. You agree?</p><p>AUTH: I agree completely. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO: Steve Auth of Federated, great to have you with us. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, thank you. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. And to you, of course, Gerard Cassidy joining us on a telephone, thank you very much sir.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko, when you think about media, are you thinking more about tech in the same story?</p><p>YUSKO: Not that I agree. I think it is that merging of TM&amp;T, (INAUDIBLE) communications is all becoming one big conglomerate.</p><p>And these vertical integrations and horizontal expansions I think are going to continue to (INAUDIBLE) right.</p><p>FERRO: Steve Auth, looking it more broadly we thought we'd get this big high push up in CEO confidence, it's there. We thought that that would then translate into a more M&amp;A activity. We haven't seen it.</p><p>We also thought that this administration would be a light touch on antitrust, we're learning they probably won't be. What does this all mean from consolidation and M&amp;A?</p><p>AUTH: I think some of the M&amp;A guidance has been waiting for this tax bill to know the rules they run. So we expect to see quite a bit of M&amp;A going into next year.</p><p>On the media front, look, there's value in these big old media companies for sure. We keep sniffing around for that reason. Our problem is we can't quite figure out how this thing gets end up being put together.</p><p>There are major cost disadvantage to the big new economy players if you will. We'd rather for now stick with the guys who are winning game, the Facebooks, the Googles, those guys just have a big margin advantage, asset and cash flow advantage for these traditional media companies to sort that.</p><p>I think eventually there's going to be something very interesting here but --</p><p>FERRO: Just a final question to you, do you think there will be some recognition from antitrust and this administration that these guys aren't competing with themselves anymore, they're competing with Amazon, they're competing with Facebook, et cetera, and this sector is a lot, lot bigger than maybe they thought it was?</p><p>TUNA AMOBI, CONSUMER CYCLICAL ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: No question this administration is more inclined to a rollback of media regulations that will provide we think a catalyst.</p><p>Now, we're a little confused by the kind of the resistance to the AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal. If you kind of take that aside, you see that the bag drop for regulation has become more attractive, things like the reinstatement of the (INAUDIBLE) discount which catalyze (INAUDIBLE) merger.</p><p>And I might also add in a long period that we've covered this sector, never before have we seen a conflict of ingredient that we think will kind of provide that next wave of M&amp;A where that is kind of the attractive stock price for media companies, the ample cash reserves, financial flexibility.</p><p>And then what we call the Amazon and Netflix factor where companies are trying to anticipate what these two companies are going to do and provide kind of defensive motivation for them to go out and try to mitigate the potential threats from these two companies as another potential catalyst for M&amp;A activity.</p><p>So I would argue that this is as good a time as we've ever seen in long time that we've covered this phase for more deals to unfold.</p><p>FERRO: Tuna Amobi of CFRA, really appreciate your time this morning sir. Thank you. Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek will be sticking with us.</p><p>FERRO: Still with us Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. Mark, it must be probably one of the biggest non-stories of this year so far, the changing of the heads at the Federal Reserve because they all look pretty mainstream to me.</p><p>YUSKO: Yes. And we're talking about hawks earlier in the year and we got more dove and I don't see a lot changing.</p><p>I do a little bit of variant perception on hikes and I actually don't think the hikes are doing anything to restrict liquidity. If you look at financial conditions, they are still very, very loose, in fact, the loosest we've had in a couple decades.</p><p>I think what they're trying to do is get back to neutral. See, for a hundred years the Fed fund rate has been equal to nominal GDP which means we really need to be back around three percent.</p><p>The problem with getting there is that the yield curve is inverted which probably we need to do a little cleansing but --</p><p>FERRO: Steve, biggest challenge for the F1C next year. Just quickly, what is it?</p><p>AUTH: I think it's just communicating with the market as we move through here and dealing with maybe a little bit of extra pressure on inflation. But I think they're in a pretty predictable play out, very few rate hikes, more QT and scale back on the regulation?</p><p>FERRO: Gents, I really enjoyed your appearance on the show today. Thank you very much for joining us. Steve Auth of Federated. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. That does it for us here on the open about 26 minutes into the session.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Jon, let's talk about it,  what is meant to be the most efficient discounting machine on the planet  has suddenly woken up and realized some tax cuts are coming.  Am I really  meant to believe that's what's happening?</p><p>JONATHAN GOLUB, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE:  Well what  happened was up until probably the very last minute, everyone was focused  on are we going to get something, what's going to be in it, what's it going  to look like?</p><p>And all of a sudden now the question is, what does it mean for every single  company separately and there's this massive readjustment on asset values  that's happening.</p><p>FERRO:  So what does it mean?  What's the kind of research you've been  doing in the last couple of weeks?</p><p>GOLUB:  Well what you're seeing is is that the market is making a very  crude initial attempt to figure out who are the very big winners which  would be companies that are mostly domestically oriented like banks and  transports and retailers, and companies that are more global in nature that  are able to kind of lower their tax rate or shield it abroad like tech  companies.</p><p>And it's literally just rotating from those companies like tech into some  of those other natures.</p><p>FERRO:  It all looked calm yesterday on the S&amp;P500, it must have missed its  rotation that was taking place beneath it.  And Steve, we can take a look  at the chart, the (INAUDIBLE) courtesy of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The high tax stocks and the low tax stocks and it's a pivot away from low  tax and a pivot towards high tax.  It's starting to pick up.  Does this  have similar longevity Steve?  Some room to run?</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CIO OF GLOBAL EQUITY, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  We do.  We think  so Jonathan.  We've been -- our last equities back in September we added to  small CAP value stocks probably because we thought the tax bill would be  going through.</p><p>The market has been a rotational market for the last 18 months and people  forget that financials had a big run right after the president was elected.   Then we took a rest, techs led.  I think it's very naturally the tech  stocks are a little stretched.</p><p>We still like them here.  Google and Facebook are trading at 21 times in  next year's earnings in these numbers.  So I didn't think this correction  will last forever on the tech but certainly the big beneficiaries of the  tax bill if you factor in the better growth, the steeper yield curve that  we think we get, and certainly lower taxes, really financials, the  cyclicals, so.</p><p>FERRO:  Steve, something I'm trying to get my head around is whether this  is a switch from low tax to high tax or high tax to low tax or from growth  to value.  Is it the former or the latter or is it a mixed of these two  things?</p><p>AUTH:  I think there's a few trends going on here but certainly our view is  there is going to be a shift to value at least the first half of next year.</p><p>You're going to have -- the economy has put in two, three percent in  quarters, people have thought that it couldn't happen, we've heard that all  year long, people have the wrong framework.  Now we have a three percent  quarter in Q4 and the tax bill, just listening to the commentary Jonathan,  people just have the wrong framework on this tax bill.</p><p>FERRO:  Well how does this working out then?  What are they doing wrong?</p><p>AUTH:  It's this Keynesian idea we've had 30 years of nothing but Keynesian  economics in tax bill.  So the way we analyze tax bills is, we go around  and we try to figure out how many dollars each person got, we added it all  up, and we say that's the stimulus for the next three weeks and we go back.</p><p>FERRO:  So what should we be doing?</p><p>AUTH:  This is a supply-driven tax bill.  It's improving the long-term  after tax returns on investment.  It is going to change the productivity  profile of the economy and it should overtime improve corporate investment  because the after tax returns on investment have just gone up.</p><p>So we see this as it's not about how much stimulus we get next year from a  dollar's perspective, maybe from a confidence perspective, and maybe from  an investment perspective.  I think people just have the wrong framework on  this bill.</p><p>FERRO:  Do you believe Jonathan Golub that we move away from capital  returns and move towards capital spending and that's fueled by this tax  bill?</p><p>GOLUB:  You know, it's -- Steve and I have had this conversation and in all  honesty, Steve was right, I didn't think the thing was good policy, I still  question that.  I didn't think it would get through and if it was, it's  quickly and Steve was right.  And that --</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.  Was it pulled back?</p><p>GOLUB:  On the other --</p><p>AUTH:  I was pulling back to your third line of defense.</p><p>GOLUB:  On the other hand, do I think that the big win here is that on  average, company's EPS was going to adjust something like 10 percent  whenever this hits, whether it's in 2018 or in 2019.</p><p>Yes.  So I think that that will dwarf the economic impact of 20 or 30 or 40  basis points, whatever the economic growth, I do.  And companies have been  able borrow at really low cost of capital and have not done infrastructure  spending when capital was relatively free.</p><p>So I'm a little bit skeptical, not that there won't be any response but  that is going to be a big overwhelming response.</p><p>AUTH:  Right.  The 150 in earnings, I think that's where you're heading for  next year, right?</p><p>GOLUB:  Well -- I mean consensus is right, if this hit in 2018 and we don't  think it will but we have $146 as a consensus view, that goes to about --</p><p>AUTH:  But $150 --</p><p>GOLUB:  Because of that $160.</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>GOLUB:  OK.  And so -- now -- but it's not --</p><p>AUTH:  But this is the owe it moment for much of Wall Street right now all  year long.  And we've done this on this show Jonathan, people have been  fighting about -- they just assume it's a fact the market is expensive.</p><p>It's just been assumed fact.  They're looking at the valuation on the  market relative to a recession earnings number in 2016, earnings recession,  115.  And the owe it moment is we're here three weeks from the end of the  year and we're talking about, is the earnings number for next year $150 or  $160?  That's 16 to 17 time multiple on a market that we were told is  trading mid 20s.</p><p>FERRO:  So we're trading at 18 times forward --</p><p>GOLUB:  But there is a different story --</p><p>AUTH:  Exactly.  Well this market (INAUDIBLE) cheap but the market is not  expensive and everyone that's been telling their client said it is is  literally now trying to back away from this position gently.</p><p>GOLUB:  Yes.  And what you also know is I've been quite bullish on the  market and I don't think the market has been --</p><p>AUTH:  You've been dead writing on the market Jonathan just so you --</p><p>GOLUB:  Right.  You're throwing me --</p><p>AUTH:  We can do something, I appreciate that.  I'm -- and you've been  consistently bullish on the market largely on your earnings (INAUDIBLE)  which have been good.  But my point is you're now upgrading it to $150,  $160, you got to be --</p><p>GOLUB:  Yes.  Or when -- and you have to wait for the exact details to come  up.  But if something, it has to move on that.  So the question which we  don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up.</p><p>And that the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to  go up, let's just say 10 percent, I don't know what the number is.  Does  the market say, I give you 10 percent extra price?  Does it say, it's a  lower quality benefit because it's taxes and it give you 5?</p><p>Is Steve Auth right?  And you say, you get that plus the potential for more  efficiency and you get 15?</p><p>AUTH:  Right.  And that's the opportunity, that's the debate now because  that bears on the thing happening, they're falling back to, \"Oh, this is a  kind of short-term stimulus, long-term,\" no difference.</p><p>Where we're different at Federated is we believe this actually makes the  economy more productive in a higher growth trajectory over the next three  to five years.  And on that basis, it's not just the one auth hit to  earnings but it puts us on a more stable platform.</p><p>It keeps the Fed at bay because of the productivity impacting inflation and  you've got a pretty healthy environment for stocks.</p><p>GOLUB:  Is the Fed (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>AUTH:  We're talking value stocks.</p><p>GOLUB:  Well I don't think there's a bear case on this.  I think the  question is, is this bullish for the market or is this really, really  bullish for the market?  And I'm kind of -- and so the question is, does  this set off another wave of spending?</p><p>Does this ultimately -- I mean, what we know is this will increase  deficits.  I mean, that's -- there's always the commerce that's telling you  that this is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO:  They're telling you -- you know it's going to increase deficits.</p><p>GOLUB:  Well this engage the Fed to be a little bit more aggressive because  the labor market's already tied and it squeezes.</p><p>I mean, when I look at market behavior, the most important thing is that  the recovery just keeps going.  If this shortens the recovery by pulling  the Fed even six months earlier, that may undo some of the benefit here.</p><p>And that's perhaps where you and I are -- there's no question on the basic  math.  The question is, second order effect, not going to affect the --</p><p>AUTH:  Productivity in the longer term growth impact.</p><p>GOLUB:  I'm skeptical.</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>GOLUB:  And you know what, I rather be skeptical and be right later.  But - -</p><p>FERRO:  You know why Steve feels so good?  He's been right for the most of  the last 12 months.  Look at him he's smiling at your end.</p><p>AUTH:  There are times when I'm wrong.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes, right.  Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse sticking with us.   Steve Auth of federated staying with us as well.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  I want to bring in Steve Auth.  Steve, are you comfortable?  Still  bullish going into next year if the Deutsche Bank will prove correct for  hikes?</p><p>AUTH:  Oh no, they're right.  I would be much more cautious on the market,  yes.</p><p>FERRO:  You would think?</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.  But I don't think they're right.  But --</p><p>FERRO:  Why don't you think they're right?</p><p>AUTH:  I think they have the wrong framework again.  The Fed -- first of  all, you can't say this bill is at one hand not going to stimulate that  much and then turn around later and say it's going to cost the Fed to  panic.  So in the near-term, there isn't a lot of extra spending unleashed  by the bill.</p><p>FERRO:  Is four hikes a panic?</p><p>AUTH:  Four hikes is a lot more than the market expects.  At Federated  we're thinking we get December, we get maybe one or two hikes next year and  the primary way of the Fed tightening from here is QT, reversing QE  basically.</p><p>And maybe they accelerate that path which actually would steepen the yield  curve which, again, would be good for the financial.  So this is a little  contrarian to where the market is.  A market is into this idea that the  yield curve is going to continue to flatten.  And, yes, I think that's bad  for the equity market, and Brett's right.</p><p>FERRO:  So let's play this out, Brett's on the phone, Brett gets you call  he says four next year, what would you say back to him?</p><p>AUTH:  I say, Brett, I disagree with you, I just don't see it.  What Brett  is depending on I believe and I would ask him, \"Brett, what are you  depending on?\"  And he would say he's depending on inflation picking up.</p><p>FERRO:  Are you dependent on that Brett?</p><p>BRETT RYAN, U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK:  That is one of the key  (INAUDIBLE) I mean the Fed's credibility is, of course, with an inflation.   I would say listen, these are valid points and one thing I would say is  that we've been in this sort of market where they're reluctant to press  much beyond the next six months in this environment.</p><p>And I don't exactly know why.  I don't think that that's going to change  its balance sheet policy but I think there's a valid point about the  steeping of the curve as we get more details out of the ECD and potentially  some action further down the line with the BOJ.  So there are certainly  risks and very valid points, understood.</p><p>GOLUB:  In order to get four next year, the Fed needs to move market  participants along that path which means they need to basically start  screaming fire right now that we have an inflation problem. It doesn't mean  that if you --</p><p>FERRO:  Pretty difficult to scream fire when there's hardly any smoke.</p><p>AUTH:  There's no inflation problem.  We've got all these deflationary  forces out there --</p><p>GOLUB:  And so I'm say, to get from here to four that means they have to  start basically getting the market convinced that this is happening right  away.  Which means they are going to -- they're going to knowingly smash  the yield curve and assume that equity investors aren't going to -- you  look at that as a sign to panic.</p><p>And I think that they're going to drive the -- if they do what's being laid  out here, they are knowingly telling the equity market that it's -- that  the party is over and I just don't think the Fed would do that unless you  have a real steepening of the yield curve and really truly visible  inflation which may happen.  But until we actually see that, I think that  this kind of call is -- would be startling.</p><p>FERRO:  Well in fairness, let's give the final word to Brett Ryan.  Brett,  is there going to be a communication problems to achieve the kind of hikes  at a kind of velocity that you think they're going to be up to deliver the  map?</p><p>RYAN:  Well -- I mean, let's look what happened over the past year, the  market had nothing prices in for dealing of this year (INAUDIBLE) three  times and surprise the market a bit and stock markets have gone up.</p><p>I think the last I've said is that even like what the Fed's framework is,  they see neutral to eight and they don't see this as a necessarily  tightening stance in a sense that it's pushing back against growth.</p><p>They see this as being a prudent move to get to neutral.  And to your point  about the stock market, they're looking at financial conditions and they're  obviously factoring in the fact that financial conditions continue to ease  even though they keep tightening.</p><p>And it's starting to at least bother them a little bit and make them a  little concern.  So maybe it's less about the inflation picture and more  about financial stability which they're taking into account.</p><p>FERRO:  All right Brett, really appreciate your time sir to join us.  Brett  Ryan of Deutche Bank, thank you.  Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse and Steve  Auth of Federated will be sticking with us up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  Mark Yusko joining the team around the table in New York, Morgan  Creek Capital Founder and CIO.  Mark, 400k, I think it's fair to say the  experts on Bitcoin and not on Wall Street, they're elsewhere because pretty  much everyone I've spoken to so far says the following.</p><p>Don't know anything about it but think there's some value in block chain  and that's kind of where the conversation begins and ends.  For you?</p><p>MARK YUSKO, FOUNDER, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL:  Well but the  problem is Bitcoin is a block chain, right?  It is a block chain.  So it is  a form of this revolutionary disruptive technology.</p><p>And look, all the bank, people that you showed, they should be deathly  afraid of this.  This displaces -- this has the potential to displace the  need for banks as a trust institution.  If you and I exchange currency or  CAP commerce using Bitcoin and it goes on the ledger on the block chain, we  don't need a bank to confirm that that is a valid transaction.  So it has  the potential to disrupt banking as we know it.</p><p>FERRO:  How do we get to 400l?</p><p>YUSKO:  So 400k is very simple, it's just math, right?  It is gold  equivalence.  So there are 21 million Bitcoin total.  No, actually it won't  be 21 million because a few have been destroyed.  So call it 20 million- ish.</p><p>So 20 million in gold today is about eight trillion, it gives you 400k.   Now that doesn't include any use cases like currency.  Like if you and I  want to exchange a medium of currency, I'm just talking about gold  equivalence.</p><p>And the reason that's so interesting for a gold equivalent is think about  gold, all of it in the world fits into an Olympic-size swimming pool.  It's  very heavy, if I have a bar, it's really hard for me to give everybody a  piece.</p><p>FERRO:  I can't even afford a single piece of Bitcoin, never mind a bar of  gold, we're not even there yet.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek is going to be  sticking with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  Around the table with me to strip back this open is Jonathan Golub  of Credit Suisse, Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.   Mark, is this still the most hated bull market ever?</p><p>YUSKO:  I think that is such a ridiculous state.</p><p>FERRO:  Will you tell me why because --</p><p>YUSKO:  Cash --</p><p>FERRO:  Wait, wait, wait, we're at record highs and no one comes on this  program saying that the market is cheap, they say it's expensive.  No one  sits here and says this is going to last longer and say we remain defensive  and then we keep grinding up to all time high.  It doesn't feel (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>YUSKO:  Well that's because the quality -- the host attracts quality client  (INAUDIBLE) you have smart people who come on the show.  And intelligent  person has to look at the market and say it's expensive, you have to do  that.</p><p>It doesn't mean it can't get more expensive but you can't say it's cheap.   There's no definition on the planet except denominated in gold.  Actually  denominated in gold were lower than 2000 or lower than 2007.</p><p>But in dollars you can't say it's cheap.  But what you can say is that we  are in a period where there's bullions and their speculative fervor towards  stocks but you can't say it's cheap.</p><p>FERRO:  It still feels unloved to me Steve.</p><p>AUTH:  Oh, it's completely unloved.  It's been an unloved rally all the way  up.  That's what creates 20-year bull markets which is what we're in.</p><p>We came off 2008, 2009, everybody in the game believes we got a 40 percent  down draft around the corner and that's what get people relatively light in  equities, that's what kept flows out of equity funds.  It's why people say  it's expensive even though it isn't, you got one year --</p><p>YUSKO:  Wait a second, how do you say there are people on investment?  We  have the highest waiting -- the individual investor has the highest waiting  in equities in history, we have the lowest cash holdings in mutual funds  since 2000.  How do you say it's unloved?</p><p>AUTH:  First of all, it is unloved based on how -- what allocations are to  equities unless where you're getting numbers from.  And I don't know what  kind of flows you're looking at but flows in equities over the last five or  six years have been basically constantly selling net sales of equity funds.</p><p>Jonathan and I were just at a dinner last night with a bunch of investors,  very typical, the kind of things I see, people are cautious.  They've been  cautious all the way up because they think even if they acknowledge that,  \"OK, maybe we get another pop here\" and then it's going to heck in a hand  basket to use an old expression.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  And it's that fear that keeps the markets at a reasonable level.   The goldilocks situation we have around us.</p><p>FERRO:  Jon, you want to weigh in?</p><p>GOLUB:  You know, markets don't move up because of sentiment because you  like it and he doesn't.  They move up because -- I mean there's really two  things that matter, is the economic expansion going to continue for the  next year or two or longer?  Yes.</p><p>Our company's generating positive cash flows and I'll take a swipe but at  the -- relative to Bitcoin which it doesn't create cash flows but  nonetheless, do as big companies spit off a boatload of cash.</p><p>Yes, if you look in the last 10 years while the economy has been weaker,  companies have generated twice the cash flow for dollar or sales than they  have historically.  That directly translates into what you call expensive  but I would call is justifiable above average valuations.</p><p>FERRO:  So about three, four minutes into the open guys, I just want to get  up to the -- up the scores on the screen.</p><p>Jon, you think this has got legs, don't you?</p><p>GOLUB:  Every single stock has to be revalued right now because there's a  new tax rate that gets applied to their earnings.  We know that tech is a  low tax rate sector, we know that you're talking about an alternative,  minimum tax for corporations which is going to make it a little expensive.</p><p>And so there's an adjustment going on until the market thinks that they're  done in getting everything to fair value which we're probably 60 percent  through or something.  We're going to see rotation.</p><p>People are not selling or buying the market, they're simply trying to  realign their portfolios in order to figure out what fair value is.</p><p>FERRO:  What are your thoughts on tech Mark because it can't just be about  technology and tax pure and simple?  These are the companies that generate  tremendous earnings growth, revenue growth for 2017 as well.</p><p>YUSKO:  And actually what's happening this week really has nothing to do  with taxes and has nothing to do with tech selling.</p><p>FERRO:  Tell us what's going on?</p><p>YUSKO:  It's a big hedge fund unwinding with big leverage.</p><p>FERRO:  What's the source for that?  What are you looking at?</p><p>YUSKO:  We talked -- we do a lot of work with a lot of hedge funds and  there's a big hedge fund that I won't name to protect the innocent.</p><p>FERRO:  OK.</p><p>YUSKO:  But they're having to unwind a very large tech book, they run a lot  of leverage.  And there are these platform funds out there and they use a  lot of managers and they all individual mangers run market neutral.  Equal  dollar, long dollar short, then the fund puts big leverage on top of it.</p><p>Five, six, eight, ten times leverage.  When that turns and they got caught,  OK, long tech and short the consumer and the media names and that's going  the wrong way.  So they're losing on both sides, they have to de-risk and - -</p><p>AUTH:  But their pain is our gain.  I mean we've got the S&amp;P at 3,000 for  next year and what I like about it is you can certainly look at the  financials.  Take at J.P. Morgan, it's trading, it's got maybe $10.00 in  earnings next year with this tax bill, it's trading at $1.06.</p><p>That is not expensive, that's like an 11 multiple.  Yet in this correction,  Facebook today is trading I think at 20 times next year as earnings.  These  are big growth companies.  I do think that tech --</p><p>YUSKO:  Well Facebook is (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent.</p><p>AUTH:  Exactly.  But, OK, it's currently pushed these big tech stocks a  little lower, technical reasons, they unwind.  I think it's going to end up  being a great opportunity.  I mean, we've been buying the financials all  year.</p><p>But I think -- and longer time but I would see a great opportunity here  setting up to add to these big tech positions.  These are winners in the  global --</p><p>YUSKO:  I was only talking about this week.  I'm not talking about a big  trend.  The challenge we have is earnings and PE multiples, right?  If you  look earnings today or where they were on an as reported basis, not this  earnings before bad stuff pro forma garbage.</p><p>But the actual earnings of the S&amp;P are the same as they were five years ago  yet the market is 80 percent higher, that's all multiples --</p><p>GOLUB:  Well wait, that's not a fair share.  First of all, you had oil  prices adjust massively.  If you take out the earnings in the energy  sector, the earnings have --</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, so that's what I'm trying --</p><p>GOLUB:  But, of course, but as soon as take out --</p><p>AUTH:  Look, in 2010 the S&amp;P earnings are $60.00, today we're talking about  $150.  It's been almost a three bagger.  Two-thirds of the run up in the  S&amp;P and everyone here has said it's not going to happen as --</p><p>YUSKO:  I'm not talking about --</p><p>AUTH:  Two-thirds of a runoff off of -- run up off of 2009 has been  actually --</p><p>YUSKO:  I'm not talking about 2009 to 2012.  I'm talking about the last  five years, 2012 to 2017, the earnings --</p><p>AUTH:  But your starting point is a peak dollar a price of oil.</p><p>GOLUB:  But over four years when you did well at the bottom and --</p><p>YUSKO:  Oil peaked 2014.  Oil peaked at 2014.  I'm talking about since 2012  to 2017, oil prices are lower certainly but you can't take out one sector.   That's like saying, I would be six foot four if I had former --</p><p>AUTH:  That's what makes the market.  It could have people that are --</p><p>FERRO:  I want to take out one (INAUDIBLE) Gerard Cassidy, obviously  Capital Markets Managing Director on his rotation into the financial.   Gerard, for a lot of people out there that have seen this run out  (INAUDIBLE) in the last couple weeks and say, \"Am I too late?\"  What do you  say back to them?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  I would say no.   When we look at the banks we are still seeing expectations for a higher  interest rates and the higher interest rates will lead to better  profitability for the sector.</p><p>And the tax rate cuts are obviously important but the bigger impact for the  banks is the expected growth that's coming from tax reform and that will  lead to stronger loan growth on top of higher interest rates.  So you're  still going to --</p><p>FERRO:  Gerard, the pushback -- the pushback sir is that the demand might  not be there on the consumer and the business side but the loan growth  might be available, the supply might be ther ready to go but no one wants  to borrow.  Do you see that changing because at the moment in the data, it  looks a little softer?</p><p>CASSIDY:  You're right.  The data certainly is specifically in commercial  lending but when you look at commercial real estate and you look at the  consumer side, we're seeing mid single digital growth.</p><p>So if real GDP is going to accelerate next year, that should drive  commercial loan growth stronger than it is today.</p><p>FERRO:  Mark Yusko?</p><p>YUSKO:  But Gerard, how does GDP accelerate next year?  One thing we know  is that deficits and debt actually crowd out and lower economic growth.  So  it's likely the economic growth goes lower.</p><p>GDP -- nominal GDP growth is equal to working in population growth plus  productivity, both of which are sub one percent.  So I don't know how we  get this big boom in economic growth and the CNI data says that loans are  softening, credit card delinquencies are rising?</p><p>Loan payment -- student loan delinquencies are over one-third today, how is  that positive for banks?</p><p>CASSIDY:  I would say first on the student loan side, that's us as  taxpayers, the banks have nothing to do with the student lending, that's  all U.S. government.  So for the banks, that's an issue.</p><p>But delinquencies on credit cards, you got to remember we were at all time  record lows two years ago and we're still at unusually low level.  So the  credit card delinquencies doesn't -- don't really concern us unless  unemployment starts to rise.</p><p>But when you look at the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, both of  those time periods within four quarters of the tax cuts, the economy in  those time periods accelerated and, of course, in the Reagan cuts, you  remember all the deficits and the concerns about deficits crowding out  borrowers and it didn't happen and it doesn't appear to be (INAUDIBLE)  today.</p><p>So as more people have money to spend as well as corporate, traditionally,  again, using the history as a guide, we would suggest we're going to see an  accelerated GDP number when this kicks in.</p><p>FERRO:  Jonathan Golub, before we lose you, Deutsche Bank was on this  program 20 minutes ago talking about four rate hikes.  We were talking  about anticipating a flatter yield curve.  What does that mean for  financials four rate hike next year, the potential for even flatter yield  curve?</p><p>GOLUB:  If you have four rate hikes that means you have an environment  where growth is much stronger and the longer yield curve is coming out.  So  what -- I don't know what this means to Gerard.</p><p>But the conditions that you would have for rate hikes would probably mean  that we got much more economic flow through the tax plan.  The yield curve  is ripping at the long end of the curve and the market may be looking at  this thing thinking, \"Gosh, things are almost too good.\"</p><p>But the Fed's not doing four rate hikes next year unless conditions are  that good.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.  You agree?</p><p>AUTH:  I agree completely.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO:  Steve Auth of Federated, great to have you with us.  Jonathan Golub  of Credit Suisse, thank you.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  And to you, of  course, Gerard Cassidy joining us on a telephone, thank you very much sir.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  Mark Yusko, when you think about media, are you thinking more about  tech in the same story?</p><p>YUSKO:  Not that I agree.  I think it is that merging of TM&amp;T, (INAUDIBLE)  communications is all becoming one big conglomerate.</p><p>And these vertical integrations and horizontal expansions I think are going  to continue to (INAUDIBLE) right.</p><p>FERRO:  Steve Auth, looking it more broadly we thought we'd get this big  high push up in CEO confidence, it's there.  We thought that that would  then translate into a more M&amp;A activity.  We haven't seen it.</p><p>We also thought that this administration would be a light touch on  antitrust, we're learning they probably won't be.  What does this all mean  from consolidation and M&amp;A?</p><p>AUTH:  I think some of the M&amp;A guidance has been waiting for this tax bill  to know the rules they run.  So we expect to see quite a bit of M&amp;A going  into next year.</p><p>On the media front, look, there's value in these big old media companies  for sure.  We keep sniffing around for that reason.  Our problem is we  can't quite figure out how this thing gets end up being put together.</p><p>There are major cost disadvantage to the big new economy players if you  will.  We'd rather for now stick with the guys who are winning game, the  Facebooks, the Googles, those guys just have a big margin advantage, asset  and cash flow advantage for these traditional media companies to sort that.</p><p>I think eventually there's going to be something very interesting here but  --</p><p>FERRO:  Just a final question to you, do you think there will be some  recognition from antitrust and this administration that these guys aren't  competing with themselves anymore, they're competing with Amazon, they're  competing with Facebook, et cetera, and this sector is a lot, lot bigger  than maybe they thought it was?</p><p>TUNA AMOBI, CONSUMER CYCLICAL ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH:  No question this  administration is more inclined to a rollback of media regulations that  will provide we think a catalyst.</p><p>Now, we're a little confused by the kind of the resistance to the AT&amp;T/Time  Warner deal.  If you kind of take that aside, you see that the bag drop for  regulation has become more attractive, things like the reinstatement of the  (INAUDIBLE) discount which catalyze (INAUDIBLE) merger.</p><p>And I might also add in a long period that we've covered this sector, never  before have we seen a conflict of ingredient that we think will kind of  provide that next wave of M&amp;A where that is kind of the attractive stock  price for media companies, the ample cash reserves, financial flexibility.</p><p>And then what we call the Amazon and Netflix factor where companies are  trying to anticipate what these two companies are going to do and provide  kind of defensive motivation for them to go out and try to mitigate the  potential threats from these two companies as another potential catalyst  for M&amp;A activity.</p><p>So I would argue that this is as good a time as we've ever seen in long  time that we've covered this phase for more deals to unfold.</p><p>FERRO:  Tuna Amobi of CFRA, really appreciate your time this morning sir.   Thank you.  Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek will be  sticking with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  Still with us Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan  Creek.  Mark, it must be probably one of the biggest non-stories of this  year so far, the changing of the heads at the Federal Reserve because they  all look pretty mainstream to me.</p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  And we're talking about hawks earlier in the year and we got  more dove and I don't see a lot changing.</p><p>I do a little bit of variant perception on hikes and I actually don't think  the hikes are doing anything to restrict liquidity.  If you look at  financial conditions, they are still very, very loose, in fact, the loosest  we've had in a couple decades.</p><p>I think what they're trying to do is get back to neutral.  See, for a  hundred years the Fed fund rate has been equal to nominal GDP which means  we really need to be back around three percent.</p><p>The problem with getting there is that the yield curve is inverted which  probably we need to do a little cleansing but --</p><p>FERRO:  Steve, biggest challenge for the F1C next year.  Just quickly, what  is it?</p><p>AUTH:  I think it's just communicating with the market as we move through  here and dealing with maybe a little bit of extra pressure on inflation.   But I think they're in a pretty predictable play out, very few rate hikes,  more QT and scale back on the regulation?</p><p>FERRO:  Gents, I really enjoyed your appearance on the show today.  Thank  you very much for joining us.  Steve Auth of Federated.  Mark Yusko of  Morgan Creek.  That does it for us here on the open about 26 minutes into  the session.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Jon, let's talk about it,  what is meant to be the most efficient discounting machine on the planet  has suddenly woken up and realized some tax cuts are coming.  Am I really  meant to believe that's what's happening?</p><p> JONATHAN GOLUB, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE:  Well what  happened was up until probably the very last minute, everyone was focused  on are we going to get something, what's going to be in it, what's it going  to look like?</p><p> And all of a sudden now the question is, what does it mean for every single  company separately and there's this massive readjustment on asset values  that's happening.</p><p> FERRO:  So what does it mean?  What's the kind of research you've been  doing in the last couple of weeks?</p><p> GOLUB:  Well what you're seeing is is that the market is making a very  crude initial attempt to figure out who are the very big winners which  would be companies that are mostly domestically oriented like banks and  transports and retailers, and companies that are more global in nature that  are able to kind of lower their tax rate or shield it abroad like tech  companies.</p><p> And it's literally just rotating from those companies like tech into some  of those other natures.</p><p> FERRO:  It all looked calm yesterday on the S&amp;P500, it must have missed its  rotation that was taking place beneath it.  And Steve, we can take a look  at the chart, the (INAUDIBLE) courtesy of Goldman Sachs.</p><p> The high tax stocks and the low tax stocks and it's a pivot away from low  tax and a pivot towards high tax.  It's starting to pick up.  Does this  have similar longevity Steve?  Some room to run?</p><p> STEPHEN AUTH, CIO OF GLOBAL EQUITY, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  We do.  We think  so Jonathan.  We've been -- our last equities back in September we added to  small CAP value stocks probably because we thought the tax bill would be  going through.</p><p> The market has been a rotational market for the last 18 months and people  forget that financials had a big run right after the president was elected.   Then we took a rest, techs led.  I think it's very naturally the tech  stocks are a little stretched.</p><p> We still like them here.  Google and Facebook are trading at 21 times in  next year's earnings in these numbers.  So I didn't think this correction  will last forever on the tech but certainly the big beneficiaries of the  tax bill if you factor in the better growth, the steeper yield curve that  we think we get, and certainly lower taxes, really financials, the  cyclicals, so.</p><p> FERRO:  Steve, something I'm trying to get my head around is whether this  is a switch from low tax to high tax or high tax to low tax or from growth  to value.  Is it the former or the latter or is it a mixed of these two  things?</p><p> AUTH:  I think there's a few trends going on here but certainly our view is  there is going to be a shift to value at least the first half of next year.</p><p> You're going to have -- the economy has put in two, three percent in  quarters, people have thought that it couldn't happen, we've heard that all  year long, people have the wrong framework.  Now we have a three percent  quarter in Q4 and the tax bill, just listening to the commentary Jonathan,  people just have the wrong framework on this tax bill.</p><p> FERRO:  Well how does this working out then?  What are they doing wrong?</p><p> AUTH:  It's this Keynesian idea we've had 30 years of nothing but Keynesian  economics in tax bill.  So the way we analyze tax bills is, we go around  and we try to figure out how many dollars each person got, we added it all  up, and we say that's the stimulus for the next three weeks and we go back.</p><p> FERRO:  So what should we be doing?</p><p> AUTH:  This is a supply-driven tax bill.  It's improving the long-term  after tax returns on investment.  It is going to change the productivity  profile of the economy and it should overtime improve corporate investment  because the after tax returns on investment have just gone up.</p><p> So we see this as it's not about how much stimulus we get next year from a  dollar's perspective, maybe from a confidence perspective, and maybe from  an investment perspective.  I think people just have the wrong framework on  this bill.</p><p> FERRO:  Do you believe Jonathan Golub that we move away from capital  returns and move towards capital spending and that's fueled by this tax  bill?</p><p> GOLUB:  You know, it's -- Steve and I have had this conversation and in all  honesty, Steve was right, I didn't think the thing was good policy, I still  question that.  I didn't think it would get through and if it was, it's  quickly and Steve was right.  And that --</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.  Was it pulled back?</p><p> GOLUB:  On the other --</p><p> AUTH:  I was pulling back to your third line of defense.</p><p> GOLUB:  On the other hand, do I think that the big win here is that on  average, company's EPS was going to adjust something like 10 percent  whenever this hits, whether it's in 2018 or in 2019.</p><p> Yes.  So I think that that will dwarf the economic impact of 20 or 30 or 40  basis points, whatever the economic growth, I do.  And companies have been  able borrow at really low cost of capital and have not done infrastructure  spending when capital was relatively free.</p><p> So I'm a little bit skeptical, not that there won't be any response but  that is going to be a big overwhelming response.</p><p> AUTH:  Right.  The 150 in earnings, I think that's where you're heading for  next year, right?</p><p> GOLUB:  Well -- I mean consensus is right, if this hit in 2018 and we don't  think it will but we have $146 as a consensus view, that goes to about --</p><p> AUTH:  But $150 --</p><p> GOLUB:  Because of that $160.</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.</p><p> GOLUB:  OK.  And so -- now -- but it's not --</p><p> AUTH:  But this is the owe it moment for much of Wall Street right now all  year long.  And we've done this on this show Jonathan, people have been  fighting about -- they just assume it's a fact the market is expensive.</p><p> It's just been assumed fact.  They're looking at the valuation on the  market relative to a recession earnings number in 2016, earnings recession,  115.  And the owe it moment is we're here three weeks from the end of the  year and we're talking about, is the earnings number for next year $150 or  $160?  That's 16 to 17 time multiple on a market that we were told is  trading mid 20s.</p><p> FERRO:  So we're trading at 18 times forward --</p><p> GOLUB:  But there is a different story --</p><p> AUTH:  Exactly.  Well this market (INAUDIBLE) cheap but the market is not  expensive and everyone that's been telling their client said it is is  literally now trying to back away from this position gently.</p><p> GOLUB:  Yes.  And what you also know is I've been quite bullish on the  market and I don't think the market has been --</p><p> AUTH:  You've been dead writing on the market Jonathan just so you --</p><p> GOLUB:  Right.  You're throwing me --</p><p> AUTH:  We can do something, I appreciate that.  I'm -- and you've been  consistently bullish on the market largely on your earnings (INAUDIBLE)  which have been good.  But my point is you're now upgrading it to $150,  $160, you got to be --</p><p> GOLUB:  Yes.  Or when -- and you have to wait for the exact details to come  up.  But if something, it has to move on that.  So the question which we  don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up.</p><p> And that the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to  go up, let's just say 10 percent, I don't know what the number is.  Does  the market say, I give you 10 percent extra price?  Does it say, it's a  lower quality benefit because it's taxes and it give you 5?</p><p> Is Steve Auth right?  And you say, you get that plus the potential for more  efficiency and you get 15?</p><p> AUTH:  Right.  And that's the opportunity, that's the debate now because  that bears on the thing happening, they're falling back to, \"Oh, this is a  kind of short-term stimulus, long-term,\" no difference.</p><p> Where we're different at Federated is we believe this actually makes the  economy more productive in a higher growth trajectory over the next three  to five years.  And on that basis, it's not just the one auth hit to  earnings but it puts us on a more stable platform.</p><p> It keeps the Fed at bay because of the productivity impacting inflation and  you've got a pretty healthy environment for stocks.</p><p> GOLUB:  Is the Fed (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> AUTH:  We're talking value stocks.</p><p> GOLUB:  Well I don't think there's a bear case on this.  I think the  question is, is this bullish for the market or is this really, really  bullish for the market?  And I'm kind of -- and so the question is, does  this set off another wave of spending?</p><p> Does this ultimately -- I mean, what we know is this will increase  deficits.  I mean, that's -- there's always the commerce that's telling you  that this is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> FERRO:  They're telling you -- you know it's going to increase deficits.</p><p> GOLUB:  Well this engage the Fed to be a little bit more aggressive because  the labor market's already tied and it squeezes.</p><p> I mean, when I look at market behavior, the most important thing is that  the recovery just keeps going.  If this shortens the recovery by pulling  the Fed even six months earlier, that may undo some of the benefit here.</p><p> And that's perhaps where you and I are -- there's no question on the basic  math.  The question is, second order effect, not going to affect the --</p><p> AUTH:  Productivity in the longer term growth impact.</p><p> GOLUB:  I'm skeptical.</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.</p><p> GOLUB:  And you know what, I rather be skeptical and be right later.  But - -</p><p> FERRO:  You know why Steve feels so good?  He's been right for the most of  the last 12 months.  Look at him he's smiling at your end.</p><p> AUTH:  There are times when I'm wrong.</p><p> FERRO:  Yes, right.  Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse sticking with us.   Steve Auth of federated staying with us as well.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  I want to bring in Steve Auth.  Steve, are you comfortable?  Still  bullish going into next year if the Deutsche Bank will prove correct for  hikes?</p><p> AUTH:  Oh no, they're right.  I would be much more cautious on the market,  yes.</p><p> FERRO:  You would think?</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.  But I don't think they're right.  But --</p><p> FERRO:  Why don't you think they're right?</p><p> AUTH:  I think they have the wrong framework again.  The Fed -- first of  all, you can't say this bill is at one hand not going to stimulate that  much and then turn around later and say it's going to cost the Fed to  panic.  So in the near-term, there isn't a lot of extra spending unleashed  by the bill.</p><p> FERRO:  Is four hikes a panic?</p><p> AUTH:  Four hikes is a lot more than the market expects.  At Federated  we're thinking we get December, we get maybe one or two hikes next year and  the primary way of the Fed tightening from here is QT, reversing QE  basically.</p><p> And maybe they accelerate that path which actually would steepen the yield  curve which, again, would be good for the financial.  So this is a little  contrarian to where the market is.  A market is into this idea that the  yield curve is going to continue to flatten.  And, yes, I think that's bad  for the equity market, and Brett's right.</p><p> FERRO:  So let's play this out, Brett's on the phone, Brett gets you call  he says four next year, what would you say back to him?</p><p> AUTH:  I say, Brett, I disagree with you, I just don't see it.  What Brett  is depending on I believe and I would ask him, \"Brett, what are you  depending on?\"  And he would say he's depending on inflation picking up.</p><p> FERRO:  Are you dependent on that Brett?</p><p> BRETT RYAN, U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK:  That is one of the key  (INAUDIBLE) I mean the Fed's credibility is, of course, with an inflation.   I would say listen, these are valid points and one thing I would say is  that we've been in this sort of market where they're reluctant to press  much beyond the next six months in this environment.</p><p> And I don't exactly know why.  I don't think that that's going to change  its balance sheet policy but I think there's a valid point about the  steeping of the curve as we get more details out of the ECD and potentially  some action further down the line with the BOJ.  So there are certainly  risks and very valid points, understood.</p><p> GOLUB:  In order to get four next year, the Fed needs to move market  participants along that path which means they need to basically start  screaming fire right now that we have an inflation problem. It doesn't mean  that if you --</p><p> FERRO:  Pretty difficult to scream fire when there's hardly any smoke.</p><p> AUTH:  There's no inflation problem.  We've got all these deflationary  forces out there --</p><p> GOLUB:  And so I'm say, to get from here to four that means they have to  start basically getting the market convinced that this is happening right  away.  Which means they are going to -- they're going to knowingly smash  the yield curve and assume that equity investors aren't going to -- you  look at that as a sign to panic.</p><p> And I think that they're going to drive the -- if they do what's being laid  out here, they are knowingly telling the equity market that it's -- that  the party is over and I just don't think the Fed would do that unless you  have a real steepening of the yield curve and really truly visible  inflation which may happen.  But until we actually see that, I think that  this kind of call is -- would be startling.</p><p> FERRO:  Well in fairness, let's give the final word to Brett Ryan.  Brett,  is there going to be a communication problems to achieve the kind of hikes  at a kind of velocity that you think they're going to be up to deliver the  map?</p><p> RYAN:  Well -- I mean, let's look what happened over the past year, the  market had nothing prices in for dealing of this year (INAUDIBLE) three  times and surprise the market a bit and stock markets have gone up.</p><p> I think the last I've said is that even like what the Fed's framework is,  they see neutral to eight and they don't see this as a necessarily  tightening stance in a sense that it's pushing back against growth.</p><p> They see this as being a prudent move to get to neutral.  And to your point  about the stock market, they're looking at financial conditions and they're  obviously factoring in the fact that financial conditions continue to ease  even though they keep tightening.</p><p> And it's starting to at least bother them a little bit and make them a  little concern.  So maybe it's less about the inflation picture and more  about financial stability which they're taking into account.</p><p> FERRO:  All right Brett, really appreciate your time sir to join us.  Brett  Ryan of Deutche Bank, thank you.  Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse and Steve  Auth of Federated will be sticking with us up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  Mark Yusko joining the team around the table in New York, Morgan  Creek Capital Founder and CIO.  Mark, 400k, I think it's fair to say the  experts on Bitcoin and not on Wall Street, they're elsewhere because pretty  much everyone I've spoken to so far says the following.</p><p> Don't know anything about it but think there's some value in block chain  and that's kind of where the conversation begins and ends.  For you?</p><p> MARK YUSKO, FOUNDER, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL:  Well but the  problem is Bitcoin is a block chain, right?  It is a block chain.  So it is  a form of this revolutionary disruptive technology.</p><p> And look, all the bank, people that you showed, they should be deathly  afraid of this.  This displaces -- this has the potential to displace the  need for banks as a trust institution.  If you and I exchange currency or  CAP commerce using Bitcoin and it goes on the ledger on the block chain, we  don't need a bank to confirm that that is a valid transaction.  So it has  the potential to disrupt banking as we know it.</p><p> FERRO:  How do we get to 400l?</p><p> YUSKO:  So 400k is very simple, it's just math, right?  It is gold  equivalence.  So there are 21 million Bitcoin total.  No, actually it won't  be 21 million because a few have been destroyed.  So call it 20 million- ish.</p><p> So 20 million in gold today is about eight trillion, it gives you 400k.   Now that doesn't include any use cases like currency.  Like if you and I  want to exchange a medium of currency, I'm just talking about gold  equivalence.</p><p> And the reason that's so interesting for a gold equivalent is think about  gold, all of it in the world fits into an Olympic-size swimming pool.  It's  very heavy, if I have a bar, it's really hard for me to give everybody a  piece.</p><p> FERRO:  I can't even afford a single piece of Bitcoin, never mind a bar of  gold, we're not even there yet.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek is going to be  sticking with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  Around the table with me to strip back this open is Jonathan Golub  of Credit Suisse, Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.   Mark, is this still the most hated bull market ever?</p><p> YUSKO:  I think that is such a ridiculous state.</p><p> FERRO:  Will you tell me why because --</p><p> YUSKO:  Cash --</p><p> FERRO:  Wait, wait, wait, we're at record highs and no one comes on this  program saying that the market is cheap, they say it's expensive.  No one  sits here and says this is going to last longer and say we remain defensive  and then we keep grinding up to all time high.  It doesn't feel (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> YUSKO:  Well that's because the quality -- the host attracts quality client  (INAUDIBLE) you have smart people who come on the show.  And intelligent  person has to look at the market and say it's expensive, you have to do  that.</p><p> It doesn't mean it can't get more expensive but you can't say it's cheap.   There's no definition on the planet except denominated in gold.  Actually  denominated in gold were lower than 2000 or lower than 2007.</p><p> But in dollars you can't say it's cheap.  But what you can say is that we  are in a period where there's bullions and their speculative fervor towards  stocks but you can't say it's cheap.</p><p> FERRO:  It still feels unloved to me Steve.</p><p> AUTH:  Oh, it's completely unloved.  It's been an unloved rally all the way  up.  That's what creates 20-year bull markets which is what we're in.</p><p> We came off 2008, 2009, everybody in the game believes we got a 40 percent  down draft around the corner and that's what get people relatively light in  equities, that's what kept flows out of equity funds.  It's why people say  it's expensive even though it isn't, you got one year --</p><p> YUSKO:  Wait a second, how do you say there are people on investment?  We  have the highest waiting -- the individual investor has the highest waiting  in equities in history, we have the lowest cash holdings in mutual funds  since 2000.  How do you say it's unloved?</p><p> AUTH:  First of all, it is unloved based on how -- what allocations are to  equities unless where you're getting numbers from.  And I don't know what  kind of flows you're looking at but flows in equities over the last five or  six years have been basically constantly selling net sales of equity funds.</p><p> Jonathan and I were just at a dinner last night with a bunch of investors,  very typical, the kind of things I see, people are cautious.  They've been  cautious all the way up because they think even if they acknowledge that,  \"OK, maybe we get another pop here\" and then it's going to heck in a hand  basket to use an old expression.</p><p> YUSKO:  Yes.</p><p> AUTH:  And it's that fear that keeps the markets at a reasonable level.   The goldilocks situation we have around us.</p><p> FERRO:  Jon, you want to weigh in?</p><p> GOLUB:  You know, markets don't move up because of sentiment because you  like it and he doesn't.  They move up because -- I mean there's really two  things that matter, is the economic expansion going to continue for the  next year or two or longer?  Yes.</p><p>Our company's generating positive cash flows and I'll take a swipe but at  the -- relative to Bitcoin which it doesn't create cash flows but  nonetheless, do as big companies spit off a boatload of cash.</p><p> Yes, if you look in the last 10 years while the economy has been weaker,  companies have generated twice the cash flow for dollar or sales than they  have historically.  That directly translates into what you call expensive  but I would call is justifiable above average valuations.</p><p> FERRO:  So about three, four minutes into the open guys, I just want to get  up to the -- up the scores on the screen.</p><p> Jon, you think this has got legs, don't you?</p><p> GOLUB:  Every single stock has to be revalued right now because there's a  new tax rate that gets applied to their earnings.  We know that tech is a  low tax rate sector, we know that you're talking about an alternative,  minimum tax for corporations which is going to make it a little expensive.</p><p> And so there's an adjustment going on until the market thinks that they're  done in getting everything to fair value which we're probably 60 percent  through or something.  We're going to see rotation.</p><p> People are not selling or buying the market, they're simply trying to  realign their portfolios in order to figure out what fair value is.</p><p> FERRO:  What are your thoughts on tech Mark because it can't just be about  technology and tax pure and simple?  These are the companies that generate  tremendous earnings growth, revenue growth for 2017 as well.</p><p> YUSKO:  And actually what's happening this week really has nothing to do  with taxes and has nothing to do with tech selling.</p><p> FERRO:  Tell us what's going on?</p><p> YUSKO:  It's a big hedge fund unwinding with big leverage.</p><p> FERRO:  What's the source for that?  What are you looking at?</p><p> YUSKO:  We talked -- we do a lot of work with a lot of hedge funds and  there's a big hedge fund that I won't name to protect the innocent.</p><p> FERRO:  OK.</p><p> YUSKO:  But they're having to unwind a very large tech book, they run a lot  of leverage.  And there are these platform funds out there and they use a  lot of managers and they all individual mangers run market neutral.  Equal  dollar, long dollar short, then the fund puts big leverage on top of it.</p><p> Five, six, eight, ten times leverage.  When that turns and they got caught,  OK, long tech and short the consumer and the media names and that's going  the wrong way.  So they're losing on both sides, they have to de-risk and - -</p><p> AUTH:  But their pain is our gain.  I mean we've got the S&amp;P at 3,000 for  next year and what I like about it is you can certainly look at the  financials.  Take at J.P. Morgan, it's trading, it's got maybe $10.00 in  earnings next year with this tax bill, it's trading at $1.06.</p><p> That is not expensive, that's like an 11 multiple.  Yet in this correction,  Facebook today is trading I think at 20 times next year as earnings.  These  are big growth companies.  I do think that tech --</p><p> YUSKO:  Well Facebook is (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent.</p><p> AUTH:  Exactly.  But, OK, it's currently pushed these big tech stocks a  little lower, technical reasons, they unwind.  I think it's going to end up  being a great opportunity.  I mean, we've been buying the financials all  year.</p><p> But I think -- and longer time but I would see a great opportunity here  setting up to add to these big tech positions.  These are winners in the  global --</p><p> YUSKO:  I was only talking about this week.  I'm not talking about a big  trend.  The challenge we have is earnings and PE multiples, right?  If you  look earnings today or where they were on an as reported basis, not this  earnings before bad stuff pro forma garbage.</p><p> But the actual earnings of the S&amp;P are the same as they were five years ago  yet the market is 80 percent higher, that's all multiples --</p><p> GOLUB:  Well wait, that's not a fair share.  First of all, you had oil  prices adjust massively.  If you take out the earnings in the energy  sector, the earnings have --</p><p> YUSKO:  Yes, so that's what I'm trying --</p><p> GOLUB:  But, of course, but as soon as take out --</p><p> AUTH:  Look, in 2010 the S&amp;P earnings are $60.00, today we're talking about  $150.  It's been almost a three bagger.  Two-thirds of the run up in the  S&amp;P and everyone here has said it's not going to happen as --</p><p> YUSKO:  I'm not talking about --</p><p> AUTH:  Two-thirds of a runoff off of -- run up off of 2009 has been  actually --</p><p> YUSKO:  I'm not talking about 2009 to 2012.  I'm talking about the last  five years, 2012 to 2017, the earnings --</p><p> AUTH:  But your starting point is a peak dollar a price of oil.</p><p> GOLUB:  But over four years when you did well at the bottom and --</p><p> YUSKO:  Oil peaked 2014.  Oil peaked at 2014.  I'm talking about since 2012  to 2017, oil prices are lower certainly but you can't take out one sector.   That's like saying, I would be six foot four if I had former --</p><p> AUTH:  That's what makes the market.  It could have people that are --</p><p> FERRO:  I want to take out one (INAUDIBLE) Gerard Cassidy, obviously  Capital Markets Managing Director on his rotation into the financial.   Gerard, for a lot of people out there that have seen this run out  (INAUDIBLE) in the last couple weeks and say, \"Am I too late?\"  What do you  say back to them?</p><p> GERARD CASSIDY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  I would say no.   When we look at the banks we are still seeing expectations for a higher  interest rates and the higher interest rates will lead to better  profitability for the sector.</p><p> And the tax rate cuts are obviously important but the bigger impact for the  banks is the expected growth that's coming from tax reform and that will  lead to stronger loan growth on top of higher interest rates.  So you're  still going to --</p><p> FERRO:  Gerard, the pushback -- the pushback sir is that the demand might  not be there on the consumer and the business side but the loan growth  might be available, the supply might be ther ready to go but no one wants  to borrow.  Do you see that changing because at the moment in the data, it  looks a little softer?</p><p> CASSIDY:  You're right.  The data certainly is specifically in commercial  lending but when you look at commercial real estate and you look at the  consumer side, we're seeing mid single digital growth.</p><p> So if real GDP is going to accelerate next year, that should drive  commercial loan growth stronger than it is today.</p><p> FERRO:  Mark Yusko?</p><p> YUSKO:  But Gerard, how does GDP accelerate next year?  One thing we know  is that deficits and debt actually crowd out and lower economic growth.  So  it's likely the economic growth goes lower.</p><p> GDP -- nominal GDP growth is equal to working in population growth plus  productivity, both of which are sub one percent.  So I don't know how we  get this big boom in economic growth and the CNI data says that loans are  softening, credit card delinquencies are rising?</p><p> Loan payment -- student loan delinquencies are over one-third today, how is  that positive for banks?</p><p> CASSIDY:  I would say first on the student loan side, that's us as  taxpayers, the banks have nothing to do with the student lending, that's  all U.S. government.  So for the banks, that's an issue.</p><p> But delinquencies on credit cards, you got to remember we were at all time  record lows two years ago and we're still at unusually low level.  So the  credit card delinquencies doesn't -- don't really concern us unless  unemployment starts to rise.</p><p> But when you look at the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, both of  those time periods within four quarters of the tax cuts, the economy in  those time periods accelerated and, of course, in the Reagan cuts, you  remember all the deficits and the concerns about deficits crowding out  borrowers and it didn't happen and it doesn't appear to be (INAUDIBLE)  today.</p><p> So as more people have money to spend as well as corporate, traditionally,  again, using the history as a guide, we would suggest we're going to see an  accelerated GDP number when this kicks in.</p><p> FERRO:  Jonathan Golub, before we lose you, Deutsche Bank was on this  program 20 minutes ago talking about four rate hikes.  We were talking  about anticipating a flatter yield curve.  What does that mean for  financials four rate hike next year, the potential for even flatter yield  curve?</p><p> GOLUB:  If you have four rate hikes that means you have an environment  where growth is much stronger and the longer yield curve is coming out.  So  what -- I don't know what this means to Gerard.</p><p> But the conditions that you would have for rate hikes would probably mean  that we got much more economic flow through the tax plan.  The yield curve  is ripping at the long end of the curve and the market may be looking at  this thing thinking, \"Gosh, things are almost too good.\"</p><p> But the Fed's not doing four rate hikes next year unless conditions are  that good.</p><p> FERRO:  Yes.  You agree?</p><p> AUTH:  I agree completely.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> FERRO:  Steve Auth of Federated, great to have you with us.  Jonathan Golub  of Credit Suisse, thank you.  Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek.  And to you, of  course, Gerard Cassidy joining us on a telephone, thank you very much sir.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  Mark Yusko, when you think about media, are you thinking more about  tech in the same story?</p><p> YUSKO:  Not that I agree.  I think it is that merging of TM&amp;T, (INAUDIBLE)  communications is all becoming one big conglomerate.</p><p> And these vertical integrations and horizontal expansions I think are going  to continue to (INAUDIBLE) right.</p><p> FERRO:  Steve Auth, looking it more broadly we thought we'd get this big  high push up in CEO confidence, it's there.  We thought that that would  then translate into a more M&amp;A activity.  We haven't seen it.</p><p> We also thought that this administration would be a light touch on  antitrust, we're learning they probably won't be.  What does this all mean  from consolidation and M&amp;A?</p><p> AUTH:  I think some of the M&amp;A guidance has been waiting for this tax bill  to know the rules they run.  So we expect to see quite a bit of M&amp;A going  into next year.</p><p> On the media front, look, there's value in these big old media companies  for sure.  We keep sniffing around for that reason.  Our problem is we  can't quite figure out how this thing gets end up being put together.</p><p> There are major cost disadvantage to the big new economy players if you  will.  We'd rather for now stick with the guys who are winning game, the  Facebooks, the Googles, those guys just have a big margin advantage, asset  and cash flow advantage for these traditional media companies to sort that.</p><p> I think eventually there's going to be something very interesting here but  --</p><p> FERRO:  Just a final question to you, do you think there will be some  recognition from antitrust and this administration that these guys aren't  competing with themselves anymore, they're competing with Amazon, they're  competing with Facebook, et cetera, and this sector is a lot, lot bigger  than maybe they thought it was?</p><p> TUNA AMOBI, CONSUMER CYCLICAL ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH:  No question this  administration is more inclined to a rollback of media regulations that  will provide we think a catalyst.</p><p> Now, we're a little confused by the kind of the resistance to the AT&amp;T/Time  Warner deal.  If you kind of take that aside, you see that the bag drop for  regulation has become more attractive, things like the reinstatement of the  (INAUDIBLE) discount which catalyze (INAUDIBLE) merger.</p><p> And I might also add in a long period that we've covered this sector, never  before have we seen a conflict of ingredient that we think will kind of  provide that next wave of M&amp;A where that is kind of the attractive stock  price for media companies, the ample cash reserves, financial flexibility.</p><p> And then what we call the Amazon and Netflix factor where companies are  trying to anticipate what these two companies are going to do and provide  kind of defensive motivation for them to go out and try to mitigate the  potential threats from these two companies as another potential catalyst  for M&amp;A activity.</p><p> So I would argue that this is as good a time as we've ever seen in long  time that we've covered this phase for more deals to unfold.</p><p> FERRO:  Tuna Amobi of CFRA, really appreciate your time this morning sir.   Thank you.  Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek will be  sticking with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  Still with us Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan  Creek.  Mark, it must be probably one of the biggest non-stories of this  year so far, the changing of the heads at the Federal Reserve because they  all look pretty mainstream to me.</p><p> YUSKO:  Yes.  And we're talking about hawks earlier in the year and we got  more dove and I don't see a lot changing.</p><p> I do a little bit of variant perception on hikes and I actually don't think  the hikes are doing anything to restrict liquidity.  If you look at  financial conditions, they are still very, very loose, in fact, the loosest  we've had in a couple decades.</p><p> I think what they're trying to do is get back to neutral.  See, for a  hundred years the Fed fund rate has been equal to nominal GDP which means  we really need to be back around three percent.</p><p> The problem with getting there is that the yield curve is inverted which  probably we need to do a little cleansing but --</p><p> FERRO:  Steve, biggest challenge for the F1C next year.  Just quickly, what  is it?</p><p> AUTH:  I think it's just communicating with the market as we move through  here and dealing with maybe a little bit of extra pressure on inflation.   But I think they're in a pretty predictable play out, very few rate hikes,  more QT and scale back on the regulation?</p><p> FERRO:  Gents, I really enjoyed your appearance on the show today.  Thank  you very much for joining us.  Steve Auth of Federated.  Mark Yusko of  Morgan Creek.  That does it for us here on the open about 26 minutes into  the session.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Jon, let's talk about it, what is meant to be the most efficient discounting machine on the planet has suddenly woken up and realized some tax cuts are coming. Am I really meant to believe that's what's happening?</p><p>JONATHAN GOLUB, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE: Well what happened was up until probably the very last minute, everyone was focused on are we going to get something, what's going to be in it, what's it going to look like?</p><p>And all of a sudden now the question is, what does it mean for every single company separately and there's this massive readjustment on asset values that's happening.</p><p>FERRO: So what does it mean? What's the kind of research you've been doing in the last couple of weeks?</p><p>GOLUB: Well what you're seeing is is that the market is making a very crude initial attempt to figure out who are the very big winners which would be companies that are mostly domestically oriented like banks and transports and retailers, and companies that are more global in nature that are able to kind of lower their tax rate or shield it abroad like tech companies.</p><p>And it's literally just rotating from those companies like tech into some of those other natures.</p><p>FERRO: It all looked calm yesterday on the S&amp;P500, it must have missed its rotation that was taking place beneath it. And Steve, we can take a look at the chart, the (INAUDIBLE) courtesy of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The high tax stocks and the low tax stocks and it's a pivot away from low tax and a pivot towards high tax. It's starting to pick up. Does this have similar longevity Steve? Some room to run?</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CIO OF GLOBAL EQUITY, FEDERATED INVESTORS: We do. We think so Jonathan. We've been -- our last equities back in September we added to small CAP value stocks probably because we thought the tax bill would be going through.</p><p>The market has been a rotational market for the last 18 months and people forget that financials had a big run right after the president was elected. Then we took a rest, techs led. I think it's very naturally the tech stocks are a little stretched.</p><p>We still like them here. Google and Facebook are trading at 21 times in next year's earnings in these numbers. So I didn't think this correction will last forever on the tech but certainly the big beneficiaries of the tax bill if you factor in the better growth, the steeper yield curve that we think we get, and certainly lower taxes, really financials, the cyclicals, so.</p><p>FERRO: Steve, something I'm trying to get my head around is whether this is a switch from low tax to high tax or high tax to low tax or from growth to value. Is it the former or the latter or is it a mixed of these two things?</p><p>AUTH: I think there's a few trends going on here but certainly our view is there is going to be a shift to value at least the first half of next year.</p><p>You're going to have -- the economy has put in two, three percent in quarters, people have thought that it couldn't happen, we've heard that all year long, people have the wrong framework. Now we have a three percent quarter in Q4 and the tax bill, just listening to the commentary Jonathan, people just have the wrong framework on this tax bill.</p><p>FERRO: Well how does this working out then? What are they doing wrong?</p><p>AUTH: It's this Keynesian idea we've had 30 years of nothing but Keynesian economics in tax bill. So the way we analyze tax bills is, we go around and we try to figure out how many dollars each person got, we added it all up, and we say that's the stimulus for the next three weeks and we go back.</p><p>FERRO: So what should we be doing?</p><p>AUTH: This is a supply-driven tax bill. It's improving the long-term after tax returns on investment. It is going to change the productivity profile of the economy and it should overtime improve corporate investment because the after tax returns on investment have just gone up.</p><p>So we see this as it's not about how much stimulus we get next year from a dollar's perspective, maybe from a confidence perspective, and maybe from an investment perspective. I think people just have the wrong framework on this bill.</p><p>FERRO: Do you believe Jonathan Golub that we move away from capital returns and move towards capital spending and that's fueled by this tax bill?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, it's -- Steve and I have had this conversation and in all honesty, Steve was right, I didn't think the thing was good policy, I still question that. I didn't think it would get through and if it was, it's quickly and Steve was right. And that --</p><p>AUTH: Yes. Was it pulled back?</p><p>GOLUB: On the other --</p><p>AUTH: I was pulling back to your third line of defense.</p><p>GOLUB: On the other hand, do I think that the big win here is that on average, company's EPS was going to adjust something like 10 percent whenever this hits, whether it's in 2018 or in 2019.</p><p>Yes. So I think that that will dwarf the economic impact of 20 or 30 or 40 basis points, whatever the economic growth, I do. And companies have been able borrow at really low cost of capital and have not done infrastructure spending when capital was relatively free.</p><p>So I'm a little bit skeptical, not that there won't be any response but that is going to be a big overwhelming response.</p><p>AUTH: Right. The 150 in earnings, I think that's where you're heading for next year, right?</p><p>GOLUB: Well -- I mean consensus is right, if this hit in 2018 and we don't think it will but we have $146 as a consensus view, that goes to about --</p><p>AUTH: But $150 --</p><p>GOLUB: Because of that $160.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: OK. And so -- now -- but it's not --</p><p>AUTH: But this is the owe it moment for much of Wall Street right now all year long. And we've done this on this show Jonathan, people have been fighting about -- they just assume it's a fact the market is expensive.</p><p>It's just been assumed fact. They're looking at the valuation on the market relative to a recession earnings number in 2016, earnings recession, 115. And the owe it moment is we're here three weeks from the end of the year and we're talking about, is the earnings number for next year $150 or $160? That's 16 to 17 time multiple on a market that we were told is trading mid 20s.</p><p>FERRO: So we're trading at 18 times forward --</p><p>GOLUB: But there is a different story --</p><p>AUTH: Exactly. Well this market (INAUDIBLE) cheap but the market is not expensive and everyone that's been telling their client said it is is literally now trying to back away from this position gently.</p><p>GOLUB: Yes. And what you also know is I've been quite bullish on the market and I don't think the market has been --</p><p>AUTH: You've been dead writing on the market Jonathan just so you --</p><p>GOLUB: Right. You're throwing me --</p><p>AUTH: We can do something, I appreciate that. I'm -- and you've been consistently bullish on the market largely on your earnings (INAUDIBLE) which have been good. But my point is you're now upgrading it to $150, $160, you got to be --</p><p>GOLUB: Yes. Or when -- and you have to wait for the exact details to come up. But if something, it has to move on that. So the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up.</p><p>And that the question which we don't know is if let's say earnings were to go up, let's just say 10 percent, I don't know what the number is. Does the market say, I give you 10 percent extra price? Does it say, it's a lower quality benefit because it's taxes and it give you 5?</p><p>Is Steve Auth right? And you say, you get that plus the potential for more efficiency and you get 15?</p><p>AUTH: Right. And that's the opportunity, that's the debate now because that bears on the thing happening, they're falling back to, \"Oh, this is a kind of short-term stimulus, long-term,\" no difference.</p><p>Where we're different at Federated is we believe this actually makes the economy more productive in a higher growth trajectory over the next three to five years. And on that basis, it's not just the one auth hit to earnings but it puts us on a more stable platform.</p><p>It keeps the Fed at bay because of the productivity impacting inflation and you've got a pretty healthy environment for stocks.</p><p>GOLUB: Is the Fed (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>AUTH: We're talking value stocks.</p><p>GOLUB: Well I don't think there's a bear case on this. I think the question is, is this bullish for the market or is this really, really bullish for the market? And I'm kind of -- and so the question is, does this set off another wave of spending?</p><p>Does this ultimately -- I mean, what we know is this will increase deficits. I mean, that's -- there's always the commerce that's telling you that this is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO: They're telling you -- you know it's going to increase deficits.</p><p>GOLUB: Well this engage the Fed to be a little bit more aggressive because the labor market's already tied and it squeezes.</p><p>I mean, when I look at market behavior, the most important thing is that the recovery just keeps going. If this shortens the recovery by pulling the Fed even six months earlier, that may undo some of the benefit here.</p><p>And that's perhaps where you and I are -- there's no question on the basic math. The question is, second order effect, not going to affect the --</p><p>AUTH: Productivity in the longer term growth impact.</p><p>GOLUB: I'm skeptical.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>GOLUB: And you know what, I rather be skeptical and be right later. But - -</p><p>FERRO: You know why Steve feels so good? He's been right for the most of the last 12 months. Look at him he's smiling at your end.</p><p>AUTH: There are times when I'm wrong.</p><p>FERRO: Yes, right. Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse sticking with us. Steve Auth of federated staying with us as well.</p><p>FERRO: I want to bring in Steve Auth. Steve, are you comfortable? Still bullish going into next year if the Deutsche Bank will prove correct for hikes?</p><p>AUTH: Oh no, they're right. I would be much more cautious on the market, yes.</p><p>FERRO: You would think?</p><p>AUTH: Yes. But I don't think they're right. But --</p><p>FERRO: Why don't you think they're right?</p><p>AUTH: I think they have the wrong framework again. The Fed -- first of all, you can't say this bill is at one hand not going to stimulate that much and then turn around later and say it's going to cost the Fed to panic. So in the near-term, there isn't a lot of extra spending unleashed by the bill.</p><p>FERRO: Is four hikes a panic?</p><p>AUTH: Four hikes is a lot more than the market expects. At Federated we're thinking we get December, we get maybe one or two hikes next year and the primary way of the Fed tightening from here is QT, reversing QE basically.</p><p>And maybe they accelerate that path which actually would steepen the yield curve which, again, would be good for the financial. So this is a little contrarian to where the market is. A market is into this idea that the yield curve is going to continue to flatten. And, yes, I think that's bad for the equity market, and Brett's right.</p><p>FERRO: So let's play this out, Brett's on the phone, Brett gets you call he says four next year, what would you say back to him?</p><p>AUTH: I say, Brett, I disagree with you, I just don't see it. What Brett is depending on I believe and I would ask him, \"Brett, what are you depending on?\" And he would say he's depending on inflation picking up.</p><p>FERRO: Are you dependent on that Brett?</p><p>BRETT RYAN, U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK: That is one of the key (INAUDIBLE) I mean the Fed's credibility is, of course, with an inflation. I would say listen, these are valid points and one thing I would say is that we've been in this sort of market where they're reluctant to press much beyond the next six months in this environment.</p><p>And I don't exactly know why. I don't think that that's going to change its balance sheet policy but I think there's a valid point about the steeping of the curve as we get more details out of the ECD and potentially some action further down the line with the BOJ. So there are certainly risks and very valid points, understood.</p><p>GOLUB: In order to get four next year, the Fed needs to move market participants along that path which means they need to basically start screaming fire right now that we have an inflation problem. It doesn't mean that if you --</p><p>FERRO: Pretty difficult to scream fire when there's hardly any smoke.</p><p>AUTH: There's no inflation problem. We've got all these deflationary forces out there --</p><p>GOLUB: And so I'm say, to get from here to four that means they have to start basically getting the market convinced that this is happening right away. Which means they are going to -- they're going to knowingly smash the yield curve and assume that equity investors aren't going to -- you look at that as a sign to panic.</p><p>And I think that they're going to drive the -- if they do what's being laid out here, they are knowingly telling the equity market that it's -- that the party is over and I just don't think the Fed would do that unless you have a real steepening of the yield curve and really truly visible inflation which may happen. But until we actually see that, I think that this kind of call is -- would be startling.</p><p>FERRO: Well in fairness, let's give the final word to Brett Ryan. Brett, is there going to be a communication problems to achieve the kind of hikes at a kind of velocity that you think they're going to be up to deliver the map?</p><p>RYAN: Well -- I mean, let's look what happened over the past year, the market had nothing prices in for dealing of this year (INAUDIBLE) three times and surprise the market a bit and stock markets have gone up.</p><p>I think the last I've said is that even like what the Fed's framework is, they see neutral to eight and they don't see this as a necessarily tightening stance in a sense that it's pushing back against growth.</p><p>They see this as being a prudent move to get to neutral. And to your point about the stock market, they're looking at financial conditions and they're obviously factoring in the fact that financial conditions continue to ease even though they keep tightening.</p><p>And it's starting to at least bother them a little bit and make them a little concern. So maybe it's less about the inflation picture and more about financial stability which they're taking into account.</p><p>FERRO: All right Brett, really appreciate your time sir to join us. Brett Ryan of Deutche Bank, thank you. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse and Steve Auth of Federated will be sticking with us up.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko joining the team around the table in New York, Morgan Creek Capital Founder and CIO. Mark, 400k, I think it's fair to say the experts on Bitcoin and not on Wall Street, they're elsewhere because pretty much everyone I've spoken to so far says the following.</p><p>Don't know anything about it but think there's some value in block chain and that's kind of where the conversation begins and ends. For you?</p><p>MARK YUSKO, FOUNDER, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL: Well but the problem is Bitcoin is a block chain, right? It is a block chain. So it is a form of this revolutionary disruptive technology.</p><p>And look, all the bank, people that you showed, they should be deathly afraid of this. This displaces -- this has the potential to displace the need for banks as a trust institution. If you and I exchange currency or CAP commerce using Bitcoin and it goes on the ledger on the block chain, we don't need a bank to confirm that that is a valid transaction. So it has the potential to disrupt banking as we know it.</p><p>FERRO: How do we get to 400l?</p><p>YUSKO: So 400k is very simple, it's just math, right? It is gold equivalence. So there are 21 million Bitcoin total. No, actually it won't be 21 million because a few have been destroyed. So call it 20 million- ish.</p><p>So 20 million in gold today is about eight trillion, it gives you 400k. Now that doesn't include any use cases like currency. Like if you and I want to exchange a medium of currency, I'm just talking about gold equivalence.</p><p>And the reason that's so interesting for a gold equivalent is think about gold, all of it in the world fits into an Olympic-size swimming pool. It's very heavy, if I have a bar, it's really hard for me to give everybody a piece.</p><p>FERRO: I can't even afford a single piece of Bitcoin, never mind a bar of gold, we're not even there yet. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek is going to be sticking with us.</p><p>FERRO: Around the table with me to strip back this open is Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. Mark, is this still the most hated bull market ever?</p><p>YUSKO: I think that is such a ridiculous state.</p><p>FERRO: Will you tell me why because --</p><p>YUSKO: Cash --</p><p>FERRO: Wait, wait, wait, we're at record highs and no one comes on this program saying that the market is cheap, they say it's expensive. No one sits here and says this is going to last longer and say we remain defensive and then we keep grinding up to all time high. It doesn't feel (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>YUSKO: Well that's because the quality -- the host attracts quality client (INAUDIBLE) you have smart people who come on the show. And intelligent person has to look at the market and say it's expensive, you have to do that.</p><p>It doesn't mean it can't get more expensive but you can't say it's cheap. There's no definition on the planet except denominated in gold. Actually denominated in gold were lower than 2000 or lower than 2007.</p><p>But in dollars you can't say it's cheap. But what you can say is that we are in a period where there's bullions and their speculative fervor towards stocks but you can't say it's cheap.</p><p>FERRO: It still feels unloved to me Steve.</p><p>AUTH: Oh, it's completely unloved. It's been an unloved rally all the way up. That's what creates 20-year bull markets which is what we're in.</p><p>We came off 2008, 2009, everybody in the game believes we got a 40 percent down draft around the corner and that's what get people relatively light in equities, that's what kept flows out of equity funds. It's why people say it's expensive even though it isn't, you got one year --</p><p>YUSKO: Wait a second, how do you say there are people on investment? We have the highest waiting -- the individual investor has the highest waiting in equities in history, we have the lowest cash holdings in mutual funds since 2000. How do you say it's unloved?</p><p>AUTH: First of all, it is unloved based on how -- what allocations are to equities unless where you're getting numbers from. And I don't know what kind of flows you're looking at but flows in equities over the last five or six years have been basically constantly selling net sales of equity funds.</p><p>Jonathan and I were just at a dinner last night with a bunch of investors, very typical, the kind of things I see, people are cautious. They've been cautious all the way up because they think even if they acknowledge that, \"OK, maybe we get another pop here\" and then it's going to heck in a hand basket to use an old expression.</p><p>YUSKO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: And it's that fear that keeps the markets at a reasonable level. The goldilocks situation we have around us.</p><p>FERRO: Jon, you want to weigh in?</p><p>GOLUB: You know, markets don't move up because of sentiment because you like it and he doesn't. They move up because -- I mean there's really two things that matter, is the economic expansion going to continue for the next year or two or longer? Yes.</p><p>Our company's generating positive cash flows and I'll take a swipe but at the -- relative to Bitcoin which it doesn't create cash flows but nonetheless, do as big companies spit off a boatload of cash.</p><p>Yes, if you look in the last 10 years while the economy has been weaker, companies have generated twice the cash flow for dollar or sales than they have historically. That directly translates into what you call expensive but I would call is justifiable above average valuations.</p><p>FERRO: So about three, four minutes into the open guys, I just want to get up to the -- up the scores on the screen.</p><p>Jon, you think this has got legs, don't you?</p><p>GOLUB: Every single stock has to be revalued right now because there's a new tax rate that gets applied to their earnings. We know that tech is a low tax rate sector, we know that you're talking about an alternative, minimum tax for corporations which is going to make it a little expensive.</p><p>And so there's an adjustment going on until the market thinks that they're done in getting everything to fair value which we're probably 60 percent through or something. We're going to see rotation.</p><p>People are not selling or buying the market, they're simply trying to realign their portfolios in order to figure out what fair value is.</p><p>FERRO: What are your thoughts on tech Mark because it can't just be about technology and tax pure and simple? These are the companies that generate tremendous earnings growth, revenue growth for 2017 as well.</p><p>YUSKO: And actually what's happening this week really has nothing to do with taxes and has nothing to do with tech selling.</p><p>FERRO: Tell us what's going on?</p><p>YUSKO: It's a big hedge fund unwinding with big leverage.</p><p>FERRO: What's the source for that? What are you looking at?</p><p>YUSKO: We talked -- we do a lot of work with a lot of hedge funds and there's a big hedge fund that I won't name to protect the innocent.</p><p>FERRO: OK.</p><p>YUSKO: But they're having to unwind a very large tech book, they run a lot of leverage. And there are these platform funds out there and they use a lot of managers and they all individual mangers run market neutral. Equal dollar, long dollar short, then the fund puts big leverage on top of it.</p><p>Five, six, eight, ten times leverage. When that turns and they got caught, OK, long tech and short the consumer and the media names and that's going the wrong way. So they're losing on both sides, they have to de-risk and - -</p><p>AUTH: But their pain is our gain. I mean we've got the S&amp;P at 3,000 for next year and what I like about it is you can certainly look at the financials. Take at J.P. Morgan, it's trading, it's got maybe $10.00 in earnings next year with this tax bill, it's trading at $1.06.</p><p>That is not expensive, that's like an 11 multiple. Yet in this correction, Facebook today is trading I think at 20 times next year as earnings. These are big growth companies. I do think that tech --</p><p>YUSKO: Well Facebook is (INAUDIBLE) 15 percent.</p><p>AUTH: Exactly. But, OK, it's currently pushed these big tech stocks a little lower, technical reasons, they unwind. I think it's going to end up being a great opportunity. I mean, we've been buying the financials all year.</p><p>But I think -- and longer time but I would see a great opportunity here setting up to add to these big tech positions. These are winners in the global --</p><p>YUSKO: I was only talking about this week. I'm not talking about a big trend. The challenge we have is earnings and PE multiples, right? If you look earnings today or where they were on an as reported basis, not this earnings before bad stuff pro forma garbage.</p><p>But the actual earnings of the S&amp;P are the same as they were five years ago yet the market is 80 percent higher, that's all multiples --</p><p>GOLUB: Well wait, that's not a fair share. First of all, you had oil prices adjust massively. If you take out the earnings in the energy sector, the earnings have --</p><p>YUSKO: Yes, so that's what I'm trying --</p><p>GOLUB: But, of course, but as soon as take out --</p><p>AUTH: Look, in 2010 the S&amp;P earnings are $60.00, today we're talking about $150. It's been almost a three bagger. Two-thirds of the run up in the S&amp;P and everyone here has said it's not going to happen as --</p><p>YUSKO: I'm not talking about --</p><p>AUTH: Two-thirds of a runoff off of -- run up off of 2009 has been actually --</p><p>YUSKO: I'm not talking about 2009 to 2012. I'm talking about the last five years, 2012 to 2017, the earnings --</p><p>AUTH: But your starting point is a peak dollar a price of oil.</p><p>GOLUB: But over four years when you did well at the bottom and --</p><p>YUSKO: Oil peaked 2014. Oil peaked at 2014. I'm talking about since 2012 to 2017, oil prices are lower certainly but you can't take out one sector. That's like saying, I would be six foot four if I had former --</p><p>AUTH: That's what makes the market. It could have people that are --</p><p>FERRO: I want to take out one (INAUDIBLE) Gerard Cassidy, obviously Capital Markets Managing Director on his rotation into the financial. Gerard, for a lot of people out there that have seen this run out (INAUDIBLE) in the last couple weeks and say, \"Am I too late?\" What do you say back to them?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: I would say no. When we look at the banks we are still seeing expectations for a higher interest rates and the higher interest rates will lead to better profitability for the sector.</p><p>And the tax rate cuts are obviously important but the bigger impact for the banks is the expected growth that's coming from tax reform and that will lead to stronger loan growth on top of higher interest rates. So you're still going to --</p><p>FERRO: Gerard, the pushback -- the pushback sir is that the demand might not be there on the consumer and the business side but the loan growth might be available, the supply might be ther ready to go but no one wants to borrow. Do you see that changing because at the moment in the data, it looks a little softer?</p><p>CASSIDY: You're right. The data certainly is specifically in commercial lending but when you look at commercial real estate and you look at the consumer side, we're seeing mid single digital growth.</p><p>So if real GDP is going to accelerate next year, that should drive commercial loan growth stronger than it is today.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko?</p><p>YUSKO: But Gerard, how does GDP accelerate next year? One thing we know is that deficits and debt actually crowd out and lower economic growth. So it's likely the economic growth goes lower.</p><p>GDP -- nominal GDP growth is equal to working in population growth plus productivity, both of which are sub one percent. So I don't know how we get this big boom in economic growth and the CNI data says that loans are softening, credit card delinquencies are rising?</p><p>Loan payment -- student loan delinquencies are over one-third today, how is that positive for banks?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say first on the student loan side, that's us as taxpayers, the banks have nothing to do with the student lending, that's all U.S. government. So for the banks, that's an issue.</p><p>But delinquencies on credit cards, you got to remember we were at all time record lows two years ago and we're still at unusually low level. So the credit card delinquencies doesn't -- don't really concern us unless unemployment starts to rise.</p><p>But when you look at the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, both of those time periods within four quarters of the tax cuts, the economy in those time periods accelerated and, of course, in the Reagan cuts, you remember all the deficits and the concerns about deficits crowding out borrowers and it didn't happen and it doesn't appear to be (INAUDIBLE) today.</p><p>So as more people have money to spend as well as corporate, traditionally, again, using the history as a guide, we would suggest we're going to see an accelerated GDP number when this kicks in.</p><p>FERRO: Jonathan Golub, before we lose you, Deutsche Bank was on this program 20 minutes ago talking about four rate hikes. We were talking about anticipating a flatter yield curve. What does that mean for financials four rate hike next year, the potential for even flatter yield curve?</p><p>GOLUB: If you have four rate hikes that means you have an environment where growth is much stronger and the longer yield curve is coming out. So what -- I don't know what this means to Gerard.</p><p>But the conditions that you would have for rate hikes would probably mean that we got much more economic flow through the tax plan. The yield curve is ripping at the long end of the curve and the market may be looking at this thing thinking, \"Gosh, things are almost too good.\"</p><p>But the Fed's not doing four rate hikes next year unless conditions are that good.</p><p>FERRO: Yes. You agree?</p><p>AUTH: I agree completely. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FERRO: Steve Auth of Federated, great to have you with us. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, thank you. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. And to you, of course, Gerard Cassidy joining us on a telephone, thank you very much sir.</p><p>FERRO: Mark Yusko, when you think about media, are you thinking more about tech in the same story?</p><p>YUSKO: Not that I agree. I think it is that merging of TM&amp;T, (INAUDIBLE) communications is all becoming one big conglomerate.</p><p>And these vertical integrations and horizontal expansions I think are going to continue to (INAUDIBLE) right.</p><p>FERRO: Steve Auth, looking it more broadly we thought we'd get this big high push up in CEO confidence, it's there. We thought that that would then translate into a more M&amp;A activity. We haven't seen it.</p><p>We also thought that this administration would be a light touch on antitrust, we're learning they probably won't be. What does this all mean from consolidation and M&amp;A?</p><p>AUTH: I think some of the M&amp;A guidance has been waiting for this tax bill to know the rules they run. So we expect to see quite a bit of M&amp;A going into next year.</p><p>On the media front, look, there's value in these big old media companies for sure. We keep sniffing around for that reason. Our problem is we can't quite figure out how this thing gets end up being put together.</p><p>There are major cost disadvantage to the big new economy players if you will. We'd rather for now stick with the guys who are winning game, the Facebooks, the Googles, those guys just have a big margin advantage, asset and cash flow advantage for these traditional media companies to sort that.</p><p>I think eventually there's going to be something very interesting here but --</p><p>FERRO: Just a final question to you, do you think there will be some recognition from antitrust and this administration that these guys aren't competing with themselves anymore, they're competing with Amazon, they're competing with Facebook, et cetera, and this sector is a lot, lot bigger than maybe they thought it was?</p><p>TUNA AMOBI, CONSUMER CYCLICAL ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: No question this administration is more inclined to a rollback of media regulations that will provide we think a catalyst.</p><p>Now, we're a little confused by the kind of the resistance to the AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal. If you kind of take that aside, you see that the bag drop for regulation has become more attractive, things like the reinstatement of the (INAUDIBLE) discount which catalyze (INAUDIBLE) merger.</p><p>And I might also add in a long period that we've covered this sector, never before have we seen a conflict of ingredient that we think will kind of provide that next wave of M&amp;A where that is kind of the attractive stock price for media companies, the ample cash reserves, financial flexibility.</p><p>And then what we call the Amazon and Netflix factor where companies are trying to anticipate what these two companies are going to do and provide kind of defensive motivation for them to go out and try to mitigate the potential threats from these two companies as another potential catalyst for M&amp;A activity.</p><p>So I would argue that this is as good a time as we've ever seen in long time that we've covered this phase for more deals to unfold.</p><p>FERRO: Tuna Amobi of CFRA, really appreciate your time this morning sir. Thank you. Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek will be sticking with us.</p><p>FERRO: Still with us Steve Auth of Federated and Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. Mark, it must be probably one of the biggest non-stories of this year so far, the changing of the heads at the Federal Reserve because they all look pretty mainstream to me.</p><p>YUSKO: Yes. And we're talking about hawks earlier in the year and we got more dove and I don't see a lot changing.</p><p>I do a little bit of variant perception on hikes and I actually don't think the hikes are doing anything to restrict liquidity. If you look at financial conditions, they are still very, very loose, in fact, the loosest we've had in a couple decades.</p><p>I think what they're trying to do is get back to neutral. See, for a hundred years the Fed fund rate has been equal to nominal GDP which means we really need to be back around three percent.</p><p>The problem with getting there is that the yield curve is inverted which probably we need to do a little cleansing but --</p><p>FERRO: Steve, biggest challenge for the F1C next year. Just quickly, what is it?</p><p>AUTH: I think it's just communicating with the market as we move through here and dealing with maybe a little bit of extra pressure on inflation. But I think they're in a pretty predictable play out, very few rate hikes, more QT and scale back on the regulation?</p><p>FERRO: Gents, I really enjoyed your appearance on the show today. Thank you very much for joining us. Steve Auth of Federated. Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek. That does it for us here on the open about 26 minutes into the session.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

There has been a Trump rally, getting a sense of maybe a less regulation would be helpful to the sector, a new proposed impact is maybe helpful to the sector.  At the same time, there are some areas that have great concern to tech industry and to me and including some of the issues around immigration.  </p><p>      How do we make sure we continue to win what's now our global battle for talent or there's too much focus I think on building walls and we need to also focus on continuing to be a magnet for talent? Things like the startup these provision or the international entrepreneur where we'll need to be part of that.  So I think it's a -- it's a mixed bag there.  There has been no question, the Trump rally now it's, sort of -- trump reality sets in where it's a little more difficult to get things done whether it's health care or tax reform as he -- as he is acknowledging in recent weeks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Well, to pick up on tax reform for a while.  How important is that in the tech industry?  Suppose there was a fairly substantial tech -- tax reform package that went through, how much would that affect your business?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASE</emphasis>:  It really depends on which side of the tech industry.  A lot of the tax reform debate is on things like repatriation or done overall lower, you know, tax rate and repatriation really is an issue for the big, you know, global fortune 500 companies.  If you focus on the startup sector, they care more about things, like, you know, capital gains incentives and so one of the things that was introduced on a bipartisan way last year, the Investing in Opportunity Act encouraged more venture capital to go to these regions we call the rise of the rest regions to fund the entrepreneurs in those other places.  </p><p>      Last year, 80 percent of venture capital went to just three states, California, New York, and Massachusetts.  We need a level of playing field, so everybody everywhere has a shot of the American Dream.  It should be front and center, the Trump agenda because that's obviously part of the reason you got elected.  A lot of people around the country do feel, sort of, left out and left behind.  We need to back the entrepreneurs in those places so the tax reform can just be focused on simple vacation or what the big companies want.  </p><p>      It also needs to be focused on really encouraging, putting the right incentives in place around startups which you drive the job growth and do that all across the country and not just in a few places like Silicon Valley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Shawn, I want to ask you, Shawn Golhar of Barclays.  To what extent is the tech rally because of Donald Trump and what extent is it despite Donald Trump because some people say it's gone up because it's one of the sectors that's reasonably insulated from some of the Trump initiatives.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLHAR</emphasis>:  Well, I think that repatriation play is really what's driving a lot of this.  I think people are very excited.  Whenever you see the tech entrepreneurs and leadership come meet with the president or meet with the White House, this seems to be an agenda item high up on the list.  And we're still learning this.  Like, you mentioned before, we're only in a hundred days of the new administration.  The tax reform debate is just starting.  </p><p>      We have a long way to go, so I think for technology companies they're still pretty excited we can get some big corporate tax deals done.  The immigration issue that he mentioned I think is exactly spot on.  I don't think they're playing up as much in the market perception of it.  I don't see investors asking as much about that in terms of supply of labor coming in but I do think CEOs and tech founders are really worried about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So Steve, what about that repatriation?  That looms large with at least the big tech companies people like Apple.  We just saw the report just say I think they have over $250 billion now on cash on their balance sheet.  How critical is that?  How much of a difference would it make to an Apple for example if they could just bring the cash home?  Do they need it home?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASE</emphasis>:  Well, I think -- I think it does make sense to figure out some way to get it home, but I think the repatriatism has to be tied with some incentives to drive job creation and the last time there was repatriation nearly two decades ago, that didn't really happen.  They are figuring out ways to try to get that money back and get an investing and the next generation of companies that are going to create jobs all across the country, it should be a priority.  I'd also say some of tech rally has been, some of these companies you mentioned, Apple, also Amazon, and others have been reporting, you know, strong earnings and so the fundamentals of these well, particularly the large tech companies have been pretty sound and obviously that's driving a lot of the market as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Steve, if they want to tie in sense to bring it home. What is the actual incentive to bring it home in the following sense that they're already using the money to buy back stock?  Apple announced the 50-billion buyback just yesterday, so clearly they've got access to cash for the government.  Is it about getting them to use that money to invest or a one-off payment to boost the books and pad things out a little bit? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASE</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's both.  I think there wouldn't be some, kind of, one-time payment.  There would be necessary because there are a lot of initiatives that obviously are funded and a lot of pay for is that people are looking for as part of any, kind of, tax reform package but in addition to that, I do think there needs to be the right mechanism and the right incentives so some of that repatriated capital does go back into investing in this next generation of startups.  </p><p>      Particularly in this Rise of the Rest cities and there are -- you know, there's things like the investing and opportunity act is exactly the, kind of, thing that needs to be looked at as part of an overall tax reform package.  There is too much focus on tax reform in terms of what's interested to the big companies.  We need to also focus on what the whole startup sector which really is where the future is going to be, where this whole third wave is going to be, you know, fought.  </p><p>      How do we back the next generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to revolutionize health care, education, energy, food, agriculture, and doing it not just in California and New York, but in Ohio and Kansas?  That has to be a focus of the administration and it should be a focus of the whole tax reform debate.  More than has been so far.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Shawn Golhar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLHAR</emphasis>:  Yes, and I think that's -- it's really interested.  I think the idea of using repatriated money to pay for buybacks or executive compensation it's not really politically tenable in my view. I think it's a hot potato to go down that path.  I think what the congress will end up thinking about at least wanting to do is something like a repatriation for infrastructure.  Repatriation for a, you know, Create Jobs in America Act or something.  You saw previous congress talk about this.  You're seeing the current congress and administration, kind of, toy with that idea and I think that's low hanging fruit to get a deal done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes, but Shawn, low hanging fruit to get a deal done, is anyone actually going to bring the money home to do that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLHAR</emphasis>:  You could make it mandatory in a sense that you're going to be taxed on this no matter what.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLHAR</emphasis>:  And you can make it -- you know, I can see from a political perspective.  You know, you're going into midterm elections, it's a really good argument to go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Look, I went out there and I brought back the $2 trillion that I promised to do in campaign trail.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  You're saying they can force companies to bring their money home and tax it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLHAR</emphasis>:  They could tax that amount and it's up to the company to do whatever they want to do.  This is the one-time opportunity and they could get it.  Congress can do a lot of things like this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  It's a bold proposal, bold proposal.  So Steve, before I let you go , I do have to ask you, one thing has been in the news, Twitter has been in the news quite a bit because they've announced a series of partnerships on videos, streaming video on their servicing including with Bloomberg.  We're going to be part -- one of the partners providing to them.  Obviously, mobile video is where it is right now in the tech industry.  Is this, sort of, thing -- something that could really bring back Twitter?  Is this the way to go?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASE</emphasis>:  I think -- I think Twitter has done a great job of trying to position for the future.  I mean, it's a great platform.  Obviously it didn't exist at all 10 years ago, has really become a major media distribution, you know, platform and people are now relying on people they follow to, sort, of curate the news for them.  It started as, sort of, a social service and has become much more of a news distribution service and adding partnerships with Bloomberg and adding more video content, more real-time E-news is absolutely the kind of thing they should be focusing on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Steve Case, the Revolution, you can see it down there, Bloomberg Breakaway.  That's what that sign is behind in there. Steve, thank you so much for joining us and also Shawn Golhar of Barclays.

Joining us now, Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. Stephen, great to see you on the program, lots to cover with you, we'll start with Europe. So tell us about your -- your valuation story around Europe, it's cheap versus the U.S., it's cheap as it ever get. Is that justified by the political risk or not? Discuss.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: My sense is that -- that markets are -- are over aware of the political risk, and I think the reason for that is they've taken a straight line through what was perceived to be a shock in the U.K. referendum and a shock in the U.S. election, and said, you know, there is an insurgent populist movement in place, every single election's going to go the same way, but I just don't think that that's justified by what we're seeing in opinion polls. So the referendum in the U.K. was within the margin of error for opinion polls. Trump, despite winning enough votes in the Electoral College to be president, lost the electoral vote, so the -- the opinion polls actually matched (inaudible) margin of error onto the outturn in the election. The Italian referendum reflected what's happening in the opinion polls, so now we run it forward. Geert Wilders is in the lead in the opinion polls in the Netherlands, but without enough to form majority governments or even the coalition, and you know, it -- therefore, either his message will be tempered, or there will be a weak centrist government opposing him. And then you go to France where Marine Le Pen is a brilliant campaigner and she's done a great deal to detoxify the -- the (inaudible) brand but, she is finding it very difficult to break through that kind of 27 percent (inaudible) in the opinion polls which suggests that she can win in the second round.</p><p>CRANNY: You have some I would say, quite bullish calls. You say it's a good -- a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the numbers, it's going to help the overall earnings, and you're expecting earnings to rise by about 8 percent this year, and dividend plays will be critical as well.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, what we're saying is that starting yield is attractive, so you know, you're starting with a level yield of around three, but then, if the market doesn't re-rate, then you would get the (inaudible) on top of that and that will give you your title return, and that's reasonably good outturn particularly considering what happened in Europe in the last -- in the last seven years.</p><p>EDWARDS: Let me get your thoughts on this story that's -- that's across the Bloomberg this morning, looks as if it's going to develop throughout the day. Trump halting the Obama Fiduciary Rule, ordering a review of Dodd-Frank. I mean, that shouldn't surprise in the sense that he's always talked about reducing regulation, and he'd been critical of some of the regulation in the financial services actually, that have been brought in by the Obama administration. This sounds like a precursor for something to come, this will excite U.S. bank stocks perhaps, or -- or U.S. markets more generally if it signifies a reduced regulation approach.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Yes. I mean, it's in line as you say, with what he said about deregulation. I think President Trump has an entrepreneurized (ph) mindset, he wants to reduce the barriers to doing business and he perceives any kind of regulation as a barrier to that. I think that -- that what he said last night is -- is actually, you should take that in line with the letters written by Patrick McHenry to Janet Yellen on the 31st of January, pointing out the way in which the Fed have been cooperating with international regulatory bodies to the perceived disadvantage of American banks and, you know, demanding that -- that they (inaudible) more in line with the administration's thinking. So yes, you know, I think that -- that it's all part of the same ...</p><p>EDWARDS: What has the -- what has the Fed been agreeing to that the U.S. government ...</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, the letter referred to membership of the Financial Stabilities Board -- the Financial Stability Board chaired by Mark Carney, and, yes, I think it referred to bank and international (inaudible) as well, so basically, to hire regulatory capital requirements.</p><p>CRANNY: But is that a case of the administration politicizing the Fed? I mean, is the Fed -- a letter like that suggests to me, the Federal Reserve is no longer independent.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, it's -- it's ...</p><p>CRANNY: Or it's beginning that road?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: It's -- it's -- it's Capitol Hill making its views felt to -- to -- to the chair of the Fed. What the Fed does about it is the Fed's business. You know, the Fed is still independent.</p><p>EDWARDS: Would this be -- I mean, your -- your focus is on Europe of course, Stephen, but some of the excitement around the Trump trade have been around lower taxes and reduced regulation, is this going to be something that cause markets to think, \"OK, it's not all about protectionism, we're back on that Trump trade equities go higher,\" technically but in the longer term?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: I'm going to pick you up on this phrase of the Trump trade because I don't think that this is all about President Trump, I think that, you know, what -- what comes out -- the news headlines are dominated by, you know, the latest announcements form the administration, but the -- the improvement in the equity markets and the move towards a reflationary trade, it started in bond markets in June, so, you know, that was when we first saw people rotating in cyclicals in the (inaudible) defenses, and looking more favorably on financials.</p><p>EDWARDS: Stephen, thank you so much for your thoughts this morning. Stephen Macklow-Smith stays with us here on Daybreak Europe. Up next, we'll talk more about Trump and jobs.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CRANNY: Let's bring in -- back in Stephen Macklow-Smith from JPMorgan Asset Management, and we've got another guest with us, we got Mark -- Mark Hawtin from GAM. Great to have you both with us. Two very diverse interests, technology, obviously, you're hot to drop. Stephen, in terms of these markets, we've picked up on it before -- before the break, you said look, you're fed up with people talking about a Trump trade, but -- I'm paraphrasing. But you said that the ignition for renewed enthusiasm was already there, so the foundation today will be his first jobs report. What's important for you today and the day this week?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Basically, I think the most important releases this week have been the PMIs in Europe, so being parochial (ph)because I'm a European strategist, but they indicated that things are still, you know, that things are still improving, real growth is -- is -- is on track to be satisfactory, it's not going to shoot the lights out this year, it will be satisfactory, and everything we're seeing in -- in bond markets and 5 Year 5 Year Forward inflation swaps suggests that inflation's picking up as well. That leads to nominal growth, that's good for companies, so I think that's -- that's the most important thing by way of background for us.</p><p>EDWARDS: Mark, when you look at what's happening in the United States at the moment, the arrival of a new president (inaudible) there's lots of politics, there's been upsetting parts to Silicon Valley, isn't it? There's been a lot of fallout between the two. Just looking at his plans as we know them so far, Donald Trump's plans, what is it that he is doing that is going to have most impact on the universe that you look at? Is it around immigration or is it other policies?</p><p>HAWTIN: I think the most headline-grabbing policy is around immigration in terms of these companies, we're going to get the talent that they require. A lot of the programmers and software engineers. But I think funnily enough, we're not going to see as much of an issue as perhaps, the market at first thought. You know, it's all about deregulation with Trump, but in the case of technology, people have been talking more about regulation and some of the big tech names in the fourth quarter of last year, Amazon, Facebook for example, were both down 10 percent after Trump was elected, and I think that's a big overreaction. So I think the regulation will be quite light touch, and actually, things will be fine.</p><p>CRANNY: Certainly from CEO level though, the -- the stage is set for, and I'm being generous here, a moderate level of confrontation is how it would sound at this juncture. They're not bedfellows are they at the moment?</p><p>HAWTIN: No, but you know, there seem to be many bedfellows at all where Trump's concerned, I mean, confrontation is his style, and I think it will be, you know, an evolutionary process, he'll manage the relationship with Silicon Valley. It's an incredibly valuable part of the economy for the United States, so he's not going to want to upset that.</p><p>EDWARDS: But Stephen, coming back to you on the -- on the European side of things or measuring up the Europe versus the United States, where are you focused then in -- in Europe at the moment in terms of your equity strategy? You say that Europe's undervalued compared to the United States, where is that screaming at the loudest?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, Europe has -- is -- is trading at a big price-to-book discount for the United States, partly because European profitability has -- has been very unsatisfactory for seven years, and there's been kind of rolling earnings recession. You know, it -- it -- it went through most of the market in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, and then, financials were under pressure, and then you have commodities and energy. And at the moment, you know, we're seeing a relatively sustained recovery across -- across the world, so you're seeing a pick up in growth in emerging markets, pick up in growth in Europe. U.S. is still growing reasonably well, and that's very -- a very good background for profitability, so we think profitability can recover from here, and therefore, we're trying to play that through areas of the market with more exposure to economic growth, so it's classically cyclicals, and that's ...</p><p>CRANNY: And that's what we've got here for you, we got the cyclicals outperforming significantly relative to -- relative to the defenses. Defenses down 8 percent, the cyclicals really on a turn higher. Does that -- does that perpetuate in -- in your view or is that -- is that already pricing in the PMIs that -- that you've just chatted about?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, my sense is that it -- it can continue because I think, you know, people are weary of a (inaudible) here, so if we -- if we just think about where you've taken that -- that -- that chart from, it looks to me like that coincides with the turn in -- in interest rates, so that's really the -- the point at which cyclicals and financials started to move. If -- if -- if a turn up in interest rate signals sustainable real growth and a pick up in -- a sustainable pick up in inflation, then I think trade has further to run, but people will wait for evidence that cyclicals are actually delivering the earnings growth that they're expected to deliver.</p><p>EDWARDS: Stephen, thank you very much. Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. Mark Hawtin will stay with us and we'll talk much more about the technology sector in just a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Let's talk about technology a bit more then. Snap, the creator of the social app Snapchat posted a net loss of $515 million last year. We now know that, that's according to the company's IPO perspective.</p><p>CRANNY: But it's hoping that non-voting investors will see past that and focus on its vision for the future. Who better to discern what that might be than Mark Hawtin, he is from GAM, an investment director there. Good to have you with us. So here's the latest offering, Snapchat, three billion bucks, believe in my dream, believe in my future, I'll make it a half a billion dollars loss, but I want your money. Would you put your money into it given the capital structure that potentially is going to be offered to market?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I obviously need to see more of the detail. We've had some of the information out overnight. There are clearly a number of concerns as far as I'm concerned. When you look at it compared to Facebook or Twitter, it stacks up more like a -- like Twitter than a Facebook. It's interesting that if we look at Facebook at the same kind of stage of evolution back in 2009, 2010, you know, Facebook was doing two or three times the growth rate that Snap is doing, and it was profitable. And I think one of the biggest concerns for the city will be the lack of profitability that it's almost mirroring its revenue with its loss, 500 million of revenue, 500 million of losses. In this market, at this particular point in the investment cycle, investors don't like that.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes, I was reading some analysis by one of our -- one of our journalist that says as a private company Snap has been benefitted from a funding environment that valued growth over profitability. Does that change or is the -- even -- or even public market quite forgiving of the profitability now from what you've just said?</p><p>HAWTIN: No, I think the public markets are very unforgiving at the moment as far as profitability is concerned. There was a very hot IPO about a -- about a year and half ago, FireEye, very similar type of profile, half a billion dollars of losses. They reported last night, missed, stock down 20 percent. The market is not happy with companies that -- that lose money at the moment.</p><p>CRANNY: Which -- you've touched on it which is Amazon, with Amazon numbers overnight, and -- and it's interesting, you see Bezos is again, going for growth, growth, growth. Operating income in the current quarter will be quarter to $900 million less than it was a year ago. So you're -- he's going after revenue growth and he's spending more money on capital expenditure at the expense of profitability, is that a warning sign for you? What did you make of the -- of the notes last night?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So in the case of Amazon, I'm less concerned. They are profitable, they're generating lots of cash, that's the key, we want to see companies that don't need to draw on the capital markets to grow, they can do it from within their own cash resources which Amazon can clearly do. For me, Amazon is the leading disruptor amongst the big tech companies at the moment. You know, if you look at CS a few weeks ago, everybody was talking about Alexa, about artificial intelligence. It's an Amazon product.</p><p>EDWARDS: This is the box that you can talk to.</p><p>HAWTIN: It's the box you can talk to, exactly.</p><p>CRANNY: I want one of those.</p><p>HAWTIN: It's an Amazon product (inaudible) solve all your problems, Manus. So I think that, you know, it's really important to look at Amazon in that context and also, to look at it not just as a retailer, you know, it's very much dominated now by the Amazon web services business and by the third-party retail business, providing the platform for other retailers, not just its own first-party business.</p><p>EDWARDS: I'm very interested in the role of India for the tech sector at the moment because we've seen Amazon talking about India and the opportunities there, continue to push into that new big frontier for Amazon, and then we have a story also on the Bloomberg about Apple announcing production facilities over in India. This is a big frontier market -- or not frontier market, sorry, this is a big market that they want to get into. Apple is not as big a player as they want to be, and yet, this is a time when politically, perhaps these businesses are being encouraged to think more about growth in the United States. How do they manage that temptation of India, the -- the political reality at home?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think that it's clearly a fine balance. I think India is going to be a huge market, but I think it's going to take a long time to develop. It'll take a lot longer than China. It will be a lot longer before we see Indian consumers buying smartphones in the way they -- they do in China. At the same time, they've obviously got to balance the requirements and the need that's being put on them by the Trump administration, and Amazon, two, three weeks ago announced that they would create the next 18 months, a hundred thousand jobs in America, so they're balancing both sides.</p><p>CRANNY: Just looking at the Facebook numbers, you mentioned China, 1.9 billion unique users, and the topline of your note is 700 million of those happened to be in ...</p><p>HAWTIN: China.</p><p>CRANNY: ... China. So there's a couple of issues at play here, one is the China effect on Facebook, and two, have we hit peak mobile advertising revenue for Facebook? Discuss.</p><p>HAWTIN: Taking the last point first, absolutely not. You know, the global advertising market is a 600 billion-dollar market. If we ex out China, it's about $500 billion. Facebook has a mere 5 percent of that. The targeting that Facebook is able to achieve with its size. You know, China has almost half of the internet population on its platform, so its ability to target and use its network effect is so strong that it can take a much, much bigger share. So it's not about whether Facebook can grow by another 20 or 50 percent, it's about how Facebook can grow by two or three, or four times more than it is now.</p><p>EDWARDS: So it hardly started. A business the size of Facebook and the -- the way it feels like just part of the establishment, you say it's hardly started, really.</p><p>HAWTIN: I think this, and it's really interesting, the sequential growth in monthly users of Facebook was faster off -- off a -- almost two billion user-base, then snap chat of a hundred and fifty million.</p><p>CRANNY: Yes, that's a -- that's a passionate call. But the next thing for Facebook though is this, isn't it a -- if -- if we're going to go three four times, right? Then we got to be prepared, if you are an investor in it to say, right, he's going to spend a lot of money on artificial intelligence, on growing the next YouTube, do you just buy Netflix, what does he do to create -- what's he going to do? What -- what is Facebook going to do to become, you know, the TV all-consuming, all content? What's he going to spend?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I mean, they're already spending a lot of money and -- and still, they have 64 percent operating margins. I mean, if they were going for -- for profitability, they could probably have 75, 80 percent operating margins. So again, it's a balance, and I think they respect their investors, they balance the needs of growing the company against the needs of the investor base, perhaps more so than -- than people give them credit for. So they will spend, they can afford to spend a huge amount of money given their size, without necessarily denting profitability too much.</p><p>EDWARDS: Does has the fake news story stick to them at all, perhaps, not materially, you know, from an investor's perspective, but does that run and run or has that gone away?</p><p>HAWTIN: Honestly, I think it's a sideshow. I think that, you know, it's -- it's impossible to vet every news story. You know, if -- if you look at it in terms of the number of stories that get put up or the number of Tweets in the case of Twitter, you can't vet that, it's just part of doing the business.</p><p>CRANNY: Are you as bullish on Apple? Because let's be frank, I mean, they -- they don't have as many ponies in the stable, do they?</p><p>HAWTIN: No. So I'm less bullish on Apple. If I was a pension fund investor, I'd be a very happy holder of Apple. It's got a 10 percent free cash flow yield, pays a nice dividend. Its last quarter suggests that the iPhone declined has -- has been halted, so we got a good stable platform. However, longer-term, I am concerned about their ability to maintain that platform. If we look back 15 years, the -- you know, Nokia had a 30 percent at the mobile phone market, Ericsson 10, Motorola 15, where are they now? Nowhere. Blackberry, nowhere.</p><p>EDWARDS: Do they -- do they have to open up their ecosystem then, do you think that pressure mounts?</p><p>HAWTIN: It's a really tricky one because I would say yes. I mean, the world is going more open, however, if they were to open up their ecosystem, they then really put the -- put the price point of their -- of their products at a more -- at a more vulnerable position.</p><p>EDWARDS: Mark, thank you so much for your time this morning. Mark Hawtin, investment director at GAM joining us here in the studio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Joining us now, Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European  equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Stephen, great to see you on  the program, lots to cover with you, we'll start with Europe.  So tell us  about your -- your valuation story around Europe, it's cheap versus the  U.S., it's cheap as it ever get.  Is that justified by the political risk  or not?  Discuss.</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  My sense is that -- that markets are -- are over aware  of the political risk, and I think the reason for that is they've taken a  straight line through what was perceived to be a shock in the U.K.  referendum and a shock in the U.S. election, and said, you know, there is  an insurgent populist movement in place, every single election's going to  go the same way, but I just don't think that that's justified by what we're  seeing in opinion polls.  So the referendum in the U.K. was within the  margin of error for opinion polls.  Trump, despite winning enough votes in  the Electoral College to be president, lost the electoral vote, so the --  the opinion polls actually matched (inaudible) margin of error onto the  outturn in the election.  The Italian referendum reflected what's happening  in the opinion polls, so now we run it forward.  Geert Wilders is in the  lead in the opinion polls in the Netherlands, but without enough to form  majority governments or even the coalition, and you know, it -- therefore,  either his message will be tempered, or there will be a weak centrist  government opposing him.  And then you go to France where Marine Le Pen is  a brilliant campaigner and she's done a great deal to detoxify the -- the  (inaudible) brand but, she is finding it very difficult to break through  that kind of 27 percent (inaudible) in the opinion polls which suggests  that she can win in the second round.</p><p>  CRANNY:  You have some I would say, quite bullish calls.  You say it's  a good -- a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the numbers, it's  going to help the overall earnings, and you're expecting earnings to rise  by about 8 percent this year, and dividend plays will be critical as well.</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, what we're saying is that starting yield  is attractive, so you know, you're starting with a level yield of around  three, but then, if the market doesn't re-rate, then you would get the  (inaudible) on top of that and that will give you your title return, and  that's reasonably good outturn particularly considering what happened in  Europe in the last -- in the last seven years.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Let me get your thoughts on this story that's -- that's  across the Bloomberg this morning, looks as if it's going to develop  throughout the day.  Trump halting the Obama Fiduciary Rule, ordering a  review of Dodd-Frank.  I mean, that shouldn't surprise in the sense that  he's always talked about reducing regulation, and he'd been critical of  some of the regulation in the financial services actually, that have been  brought in by the Obama administration.  This sounds like a precursor for  something to come, this will excite U.S. bank stocks perhaps, or -- or U.S.  markets more generally if it signifies a reduced regulation approach.</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Yes.  I mean, it's in line as you say, with what he  said about deregulation.  I think President Trump has an entrepreneurized  (ph) mindset, he wants to reduce the barriers to doing business and he  perceives any kind of regulation as a barrier to that.  I think that --  that what he said last night is -- is actually, you should take that in  line with the letters written by Patrick McHenry to Janet Yellen on the  31st of January, pointing out the way in which the Fed have been  cooperating with international regulatory bodies to the perceived  disadvantage of American banks and, you know, demanding that -- that they  (inaudible) more in line with the administration's thinking.  So yes, you  know, I think that -- that it's all part of the same ...</p><p>  EDWARDS:  What has the -- what has the Fed been agreeing to that the  U.S. government ...</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, the letter referred to membership of the  Financial Stabilities Board -- the Financial Stability Board chaired by  Mark Carney, and, yes, I think it referred to bank and international  (inaudible) as well, so basically, to hire regulatory capital requirements.</p><p>  CRANNY:  But is that a case of the administration politicizing the  Fed?  I mean, is the Fed -- a letter like that suggests to me, the Federal  Reserve is no longer independent.</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, it's -- it's ...</p><p>  CRANNY:  Or it's beginning that road?</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  It's -- it's -- it's Capitol Hill making its views  felt to -- to -- to the chair of the Fed.  What the Fed does about it is  the Fed's business.  You know, the Fed is still independent.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Would this be -- I mean, your -- your focus is on Europe of  course, Stephen, but some of the excitement around the Trump trade have  been around lower taxes and reduced regulation, is this going to be  something that cause markets to think, \"OK, it's not all about  protectionism, we're back on that Trump trade equities go higher,\"  technically but in the longer term?</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  I'm going to pick you up on this phrase of the Trump  trade because I don't think that this is all about President Trump, I think  that, you know, what -- what comes out -- the news headlines are dominated  by, you know, the latest announcements form the administration, but the --  the improvement in the equity markets and the move towards a reflationary  trade, it started in bond markets in June, so, you know, that was when we  first saw people rotating in cyclicals in the (inaudible) defenses, and  looking more favorably on financials.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Stephen, thank you so much for your thoughts this morning.   Stephen Macklow-Smith stays with us here on Daybreak Europe.  Up next,  we'll talk more about Trump and jobs.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  CRANNY:  Let's bring in -- back in Stephen Macklow-Smith from JPMorgan  Asset Management, and we've got another guest with us, we got Mark -- Mark  Hawtin from GAM.  Great to have you both with us.  Two very diverse  interests, technology, obviously, you're hot to drop.  Stephen, in terms of  these markets, we've picked up on it before -- before the break, you said  look, you're fed up with people talking about a Trump trade, but -- I'm  paraphrasing.  But you said that the ignition for renewed enthusiasm was  already there, so the foundation today will be his first jobs report.   What's important for you today and the day this week?</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Basically, I think the most important releases this  week have been the PMIs in Europe, so being parochial (ph)because I'm a  European strategist, but they indicated that things are still, you know,  that things are still improving, real growth is -- is -- is on track to be  satisfactory, it's not going to shoot the lights out this year, it will be  satisfactory, and everything we're seeing in -- in bond markets and 5 Year  5 Year Forward inflation swaps suggests that inflation's picking up as  well.  That leads to nominal growth, that's good for companies, so I think  that's -- that's the most important thing by way of background for us.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Mark, when you look at what's happening in the United States  at the moment, the arrival of a new president (inaudible) there's lots of  politics, there's been upsetting parts to Silicon Valley, isn't it?   There's been a lot of fallout between the two.  Just looking at his plans  as we know them so far, Donald Trump's plans, what is it that he is doing  that is going to have most impact on the universe that you look at?  Is it  around immigration or is it other policies?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  I think the most headline-grabbing policy is around  immigration in terms of these companies, we're going to get the talent that  they require.  A lot of the programmers and software engineers.  But I  think funnily enough, we're not going to see as much of an issue as  perhaps, the market at first thought.  You know, it's all about  deregulation with Trump, but in the case of technology, people have been  talking more about regulation and some of the big tech names in the fourth  quarter of last year, Amazon, Facebook for example, were both down 10  percent after Trump was elected, and I think that's a big overreaction.  So  I think the regulation will be quite light touch, and actually, things will  be fine.</p><p>  CRANNY:  Certainly from CEO level though, the -- the stage is set for,  and I'm being generous here, a moderate level of confrontation is how it  would sound at this juncture.  They're not bedfellows are they at the  moment?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  No, but you know, there seem to be many bedfellows at all  where Trump's concerned, I mean, confrontation is his style, and I think it  will be, you know, an evolutionary process, he'll manage the relationship  with Silicon Valley.  It's an incredibly valuable part of the economy for  the United States, so he's not going to want to upset that.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  But Stephen, coming back to you on the -- on the European  side of things or measuring up the Europe versus the United States, where  are you focused then in -- in Europe at the moment in terms of your equity  strategy?  You say that Europe's undervalued compared to the United States,  where is that screaming at the loudest?</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, Europe has -- is -- is trading at a big  price-to-book discount for the United States, partly because European  profitability has -- has been very unsatisfactory for seven years, and  there's been kind of rolling earnings recession.  You know, it -- it -- it  went through most of the market in the immediate aftermath of the crisis,  and then, financials were under pressure, and then you have commodities and  energy.  And at the moment, you know, we're seeing a relatively sustained  recovery across -- across the world, so you're seeing a pick up in growth  in emerging markets, pick up in growth in Europe.  U.S. is still growing  reasonably well, and that's very -- a very good background for  profitability, so we think profitability can recover from here, and  therefore, we're trying to play that through areas of the market with more  exposure to economic growth, so it's classically cyclicals, and that's ...</p><p>  CRANNY:  And that's what we've got here for you, we got the cyclicals  outperforming significantly relative to -- relative to the defenses.   Defenses down 8 percent, the cyclicals really on a turn higher.  Does that  -- does that perpetuate in -- in your view or is that -- is that already  pricing in the PMIs that -- that you've just chatted about?</p><p>  MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, my sense is that it -- it can continue because I  think, you know, people are weary of a (inaudible) here, so if we -- if we  just think about where you've taken that -- that -- that chart from, it  looks to me like that coincides with the turn in -- in interest rates, so  that's really the -- the point at which cyclicals and financials started to  move.  If -- if -- if a turn up in interest rate signals sustainable real  growth and a pick up in -- a sustainable pick up in inflation, then I think  trade has further to run, but people will wait for evidence that cyclicals  are actually delivering the earnings growth that they're expected to  deliver.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Stephen, thank you very much.  Stephen Macklow-Smith, head  of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Mark Hawtin will  stay with us and we'll talk much more about the technology sector in just a  moment.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Let's talk about technology a bit more then.  Snap, the  creator of the social app Snapchat posted a net loss of $515 million last  year.  We now know that, that's according to the company's IPO perspective.</p><p>  CRANNY:  But it's hoping that non-voting investors will see past that  and focus on its vision for the future.  Who better to discern what that  might be than Mark Hawtin, he is from GAM, an investment director there.   Good to have you with us.  So here's the latest offering, Snapchat, three  billion bucks, believe in my dream, believe in my future, I'll make it a  half a billion dollars loss, but I want your money.  Would you put your  money into it given the capital structure that potentially is going to be  offered to market?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  Well, I obviously need to see more of the detail.  We've had  some of the information out overnight.  There are clearly a number of  concerns as far as I'm concerned.  When you look at it compared to Facebook  or Twitter, it stacks up more like a -- like Twitter than a Facebook.  It's  interesting that if we look at Facebook at the same kind of stage of  evolution back in 2009, 2010, you know, Facebook was doing two or three  times the growth rate that Snap is doing, and it was profitable.  And I  think one of the biggest concerns for the city will be the lack of  profitability that it's almost mirroring its revenue with its loss, 500  million of revenue, 500 million of losses.  In this market, at this  particular point in the investment cycle, investors don't like that.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Yes, I was reading some analysis by one of our -- one of our  journalist that says as a private company Snap has been benefitted from a  funding environment that valued growth over profitability.  Does that  change or is the -- even -- or even public market quite forgiving of the  profitability now from what you've just said?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  No, I think the public markets are very unforgiving at the  moment as far as profitability is concerned.  There was a very hot IPO  about a -- about a year and half ago, FireEye, very similar type of  profile, half a billion dollars of losses.  They reported last night,  missed, stock down 20 percent.  The market is not happy with companies that  -- that lose money at the moment.</p><p>  CRANNY:  Which -- you've touched on it which is Amazon, with Amazon  numbers overnight, and -- and it's interesting, you see Bezos is again,  going for growth, growth, growth.  Operating income in the current quarter  will be quarter to $900 million less than it was a year ago.  So you're --  he's going after revenue growth and he's spending more money on capital  expenditure at the expense of profitability, is that a warning sign for  you?  What did you make of the -- of the notes last night?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  OK.  So in the case of Amazon, I'm less concerned.  They are  profitable, they're generating lots of cash, that's the key, we want to see  companies that don't need to draw on the capital markets to grow, they can  do it from within their own cash resources which Amazon can clearly do.   For me, Amazon is the leading disruptor amongst the big tech companies at  the moment.  You know, if you look at CS a few weeks ago, everybody was  talking about Alexa, about artificial intelligence.  It's an Amazon  product.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  This is the box that you can talk to.</p><p>  HAWTIN:  It's the box you can talk to, exactly.</p><p>  CRANNY:  I want one of those.</p><p>  HAWTIN:  It's an Amazon product (inaudible) solve all your problems,  Manus.  So I think that, you know, it's really important to look at Amazon  in that context and also, to look at it not just as a retailer, you know,  it's very much dominated now by the Amazon web services business and by the  third-party retail business, providing the platform for other retailers,  not just its own first-party business.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  I'm very interested in the role of India for the tech sector  at the moment because we've seen Amazon talking about India and the  opportunities there, continue to push into that new big frontier for  Amazon, and then we have a story also on the Bloomberg about Apple  announcing production facilities over in India.  This is a big frontier  market -- or not frontier market, sorry, this is a big market that they  want to get into.  Apple is not as big a player as they want to be, and  yet, this is a time when politically, perhaps these businesses are being  encouraged to think more about growth in the United States.  How do they  manage that temptation of India, the -- the political reality at home?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  Well, I think that it's clearly a fine balance.  I think  India is going to be a huge market, but I think it's going to take a long  time to develop.  It'll take a lot longer than China.  It will be a lot  longer before we see Indian consumers buying smartphones in the way they --  they do in China.  At the same time, they've obviously got to balance the  requirements and the need that's being put on them by the Trump  administration, and Amazon, two, three weeks ago announced that they would  create the next 18 months, a hundred thousand jobs in America, so they're  balancing both sides.</p><p>  CRANNY:  Just looking at the Facebook numbers, you mentioned China,  1.9 billion unique users, and the topline of your note is 700 million of  those happened to be in ...</p><p>  HAWTIN:  China.</p><p>  CRANNY:  ... China.  So there's a couple of issues at play here, one  is the China effect on Facebook, and two, have we hit peak mobile  advertising revenue for Facebook?  Discuss.</p><p>  HAWTIN:  Taking the last point first, absolutely not.  You know, the  global advertising market is a 600 billion-dollar market.  If we ex out  China, it's about $500 billion.  Facebook has a mere 5 percent of that.   The targeting that Facebook is able to achieve with its size.  You know,  China has almost half of the internet population on its platform, so its  ability to target and use its network effect is so strong that it can take  a much, much bigger share.  So it's not about whether Facebook can grow by  another 20 or 50 percent, it's about how Facebook can grow by two or three,  or four times more than it is now.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  So it hardly started.  A business the size of Facebook and  the -- the way it feels like just part of the establishment, you say it's  hardly started, really.</p><p>  HAWTIN:  I think this, and it's really interesting, the sequential  growth in monthly users of Facebook was faster off -- off a -- almost two  billion user-base, then snap chat of a hundred and fifty million.</p><p>  CRANNY:  Yes, that's a -- that's a passionate call.  But the next  thing for Facebook though is this, isn't it a -- if -- if we're going to go  three four times, right?  Then we got to be prepared, if you are an  investor in it to say, right, he's going to spend a lot of money on  artificial intelligence, on growing the next YouTube, do you just buy  Netflix, what does he do to create -- what's he going to do?  What -- what  is Facebook going to do to become, you know, the TV all-consuming, all  content?  What's he going to spend?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  Well, I mean, they're already spending a lot of money and --  and still, they have 64 percent operating margins.  I mean, if they were  going for -- for profitability, they could probably have 75, 80 percent  operating margins.  So again, it's a balance, and I think they respect  their investors, they balance the needs of growing the company against the  needs of the investor base, perhaps more so than -- than people give them  credit for.  So they will spend, they can afford to spend a huge amount of  money given their size, without necessarily denting profitability too much.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Does has the fake news story stick to them at all, perhaps,  not materially, you know, from an investor's perspective, but does that run  and run or has that gone away?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  Honestly, I think it's a sideshow.  I think that, you know,  it's -- it's impossible to vet every news story.  You know, if -- if you  look at it in terms of the number of stories that get put up or the number  of Tweets in the case of Twitter, you can't vet that, it's just part of  doing the business.</p><p>  CRANNY:  Are you as bullish on Apple?  Because let's be frank, I mean,  they -- they don't have as many ponies in the stable, do they?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  No.  So I'm less bullish on Apple.  If I was a pension fund  investor, I'd be a very happy holder of Apple.  It's got a 10 percent free  cash flow yield, pays a nice dividend.  Its last quarter suggests that the  iPhone declined has -- has been halted, so we got a good stable platform.   However, longer-term, I am concerned about their ability to maintain that  platform.  If we look back 15 years, the -- you know, Nokia had a 30  percent at the mobile phone market, Ericsson 10, Motorola 15, where are  they now?  Nowhere.  Blackberry, nowhere.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Do they -- do they have to open up their ecosystem then, do  you think that pressure mounts?</p><p>  HAWTIN:  It's a really tricky one because I would say yes.  I mean,  the world is going more open, however, if they were to open up their  ecosystem, they then really put the -- put the price point of their -- of  their products at a more -- at a more vulnerable position.</p><p>  EDWARDS:  Mark, thank you so much for your time this morning.  Mark  Hawtin, investment director at GAM joining us here in the studio.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Joining us now, Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European  equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Stephen, great to see you on  the program, lots to cover with you, we'll start with Europe.  So tell us  about your -- your valuation story around Europe, it's cheap versus the  U.S., it's cheap as it ever get.  Is that justified by the political risk  or not?  Discuss.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  My sense is that -- that markets are -- are over aware  of the political risk, and I think the reason for that is they've taken a  straight line through what was perceived to be a shock in the U.K.  referendum and a shock in the U.S. election, and said, you know, there is  an insurgent populist movement in place, every single election's going to  go the same way, but I just don't think that that's justified by what we're  seeing in opinion polls.  So the referendum in the U.K. was within the  margin of error for opinion polls.  Trump, despite winning enough votes in  the Electoral College to be president, lost the electoral vote, so the --  the opinion polls actually matched (inaudible) margin of error onto the  outturn in the election.  The Italian referendum reflected what's happening  in the opinion polls, so now we run it forward.  Geert Wilders is in the  lead in the opinion polls in the Netherlands, but without enough to form  majority governments or even the coalition, and you know, it -- therefore,  either his message will be tempered, or there will be a weak centrist  government opposing him.  And then you go to France where Marine Le Pen is  a brilliant campaigner and she's done a great deal to detoxify the -- the  (inaudible) brand but, she is finding it very difficult to break through  that kind of 27 percent (inaudible) in the opinion polls which suggests  that she can win in the second round.</p><p>CRANNY:  You have some I would say, quite bullish calls.  You say it's  a good -- a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the numbers, it's  going to help the overall earnings, and you're expecting earnings to rise  by about 8 percent this year, and dividend plays will be critical as well.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, what we're saying is that starting yield  is attractive, so you know, you're starting with a level yield of around  three, but then, if the market doesn't re-rate, then you would get the  (inaudible) on top of that and that will give you your title return, and  that's reasonably good outturn particularly considering what happened in  Europe in the last -- in the last seven years.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Let me get your thoughts on this story that's -- that's  across the Bloomberg this morning, looks as if it's going to develop  throughout the day.  Trump halting the Obama Fiduciary Rule, ordering a  review of Dodd-Frank.  I mean, that shouldn't surprise in the sense that  he's always talked about reducing regulation, and he'd been critical of  some of the regulation in the financial services actually, that have been  brought in by the Obama administration.  This sounds like a precursor for  something to come, this will excite U.S. bank stocks perhaps, or -- or U.S.  markets more generally if it signifies a reduced regulation approach.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Yes.  I mean, it's in line as you say, with what he  said about deregulation.  I think President Trump has an entrepreneurized  (ph) mindset, he wants to reduce the barriers to doing business and he  perceives any kind of regulation as a barrier to that.  I think that --  that what he said last night is -- is actually, you should take that in  line with the letters written by Patrick McHenry to Janet Yellen on the  31st of January, pointing out the way in which the Fed have been  cooperating with international regulatory bodies to the perceived  disadvantage of American banks and, you know, demanding that -- that they  (inaudible) more in line with the administration's thinking.  So yes, you  know, I think that -- that it's all part of the same ...</p><p>EDWARDS:  What has the -- what has the Fed been agreeing to that the  U.S. government ...</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, the letter referred to membership of the  Financial Stabilities Board -- the Financial Stability Board chaired by  Mark Carney, and, yes, I think it referred to bank and international  (inaudible) as well, so basically, to hire regulatory capital requirements.</p><p>CRANNY:  But is that a case of the administration politicizing the  Fed?  I mean, is the Fed -- a letter like that suggests to me, the Federal  Reserve is no longer independent.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, it's -- it's ...</p><p>CRANNY:  Or it's beginning that road?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  It's -- it's -- it's Capitol Hill making its views  felt to -- to -- to the chair of the Fed.  What the Fed does about it is  the Fed's business.  You know, the Fed is still independent.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Would this be -- I mean, your -- your focus is on Europe of  course, Stephen, but some of the excitement around the Trump trade have  been around lower taxes and reduced regulation, is this going to be  something that cause markets to think, \"OK, it's not all about  protectionism, we're back on that Trump trade equities go higher,\"  technically but in the longer term?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  I'm going to pick you up on this phrase of the Trump  trade because I don't think that this is all about President Trump, I think  that, you know, what -- what comes out -- the news headlines are dominated  by, you know, the latest announcements form the administration, but the --  the improvement in the equity markets and the move towards a reflationary  trade, it started in bond markets in June, so, you know, that was when we  first saw people rotating in cyclicals in the (inaudible) defenses, and  looking more favorably on financials.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Stephen, thank you so much for your thoughts this morning.   Stephen Macklow-Smith stays with us here on Daybreak Europe.  Up next,  we'll talk more about Trump and jobs.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CRANNY:  Let's bring in -- back in Stephen Macklow-Smith from JPMorgan  Asset Management, and we've got another guest with us, we got Mark -- Mark  Hawtin from GAM.  Great to have you both with us.  Two very diverse  interests, technology, obviously, you're hot to drop.  Stephen, in terms of  these markets, we've picked up on it before -- before the break, you said  look, you're fed up with people talking about a Trump trade, but -- I'm  paraphrasing.  But you said that the ignition for renewed enthusiasm was  already there, so the foundation today will be his first jobs report.   What's important for you today and the day this week?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Basically, I think the most important releases this  week have been the PMIs in Europe, so being parochial (ph)because I'm a  European strategist, but they indicated that things are still, you know,  that things are still improving, real growth is -- is -- is on track to be  satisfactory, it's not going to shoot the lights out this year, it will be  satisfactory, and everything we're seeing in -- in bond markets and 5 Year  5 Year Forward inflation swaps suggests that inflation's picking up as  well.  That leads to nominal growth, that's good for companies, so I think  that's -- that's the most important thing by way of background for us.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Mark, when you look at what's happening in the United States  at the moment, the arrival of a new president (inaudible) there's lots of  politics, there's been upsetting parts to Silicon Valley, isn't it?   There's been a lot of fallout between the two.  Just looking at his plans  as we know them so far, Donald Trump's plans, what is it that he is doing  that is going to have most impact on the universe that you look at?  Is it  around immigration or is it other policies?</p><p>HAWTIN:  I think the most headline-grabbing policy is around  immigration in terms of these companies, we're going to get the talent that  they require.  A lot of the programmers and software engineers.  But I  think funnily enough, we're not going to see as much of an issue as  perhaps, the market at first thought.  You know, it's all about  deregulation with Trump, but in the case of technology, people have been  talking more about regulation and some of the big tech names in the fourth  quarter of last year, Amazon, Facebook for example, were both down 10  percent after Trump was elected, and I think that's a big overreaction.  So  I think the regulation will be quite light touch, and actually, things will  be fine.</p><p>CRANNY:  Certainly from CEO level though, the -- the stage is set for,  and I'm being generous here, a moderate level of confrontation is how it  would sound at this juncture.  They're not bedfellows are they at the  moment?</p><p>HAWTIN:  No, but you know, there seem to be many bedfellows at all  where Trump's concerned, I mean, confrontation is his style, and I think it  will be, you know, an evolutionary process, he'll manage the relationship  with Silicon Valley.  It's an incredibly valuable part of the economy for  the United States, so he's not going to want to upset that.</p><p>EDWARDS:  But Stephen, coming back to you on the -- on the European  side of things or measuring up the Europe versus the United States, where  are you focused then in -- in Europe at the moment in terms of your equity  strategy?  You say that Europe's undervalued compared to the United States,  where is that screaming at the loudest?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, I mean, Europe has -- is -- is trading at a big  price-to-book discount for the United States, partly because European  profitability has -- has been very unsatisfactory for seven years, and  there's been kind of rolling earnings recession.  You know, it -- it -- it  went through most of the market in the immediate aftermath of the crisis,  and then, financials were under pressure, and then you have commodities and  energy.  And at the moment, you know, we're seeing a relatively sustained  recovery across -- across the world, so you're seeing a pick up in growth  in emerging markets, pick up in growth in Europe.  U.S. is still growing  reasonably well, and that's very -- a very good background for  profitability, so we think profitability can recover from here, and  therefore, we're trying to play that through areas of the market with more  exposure to economic growth, so it's classically cyclicals, and that's ...</p><p>CRANNY:  And that's what we've got here for you, we got the cyclicals  outperforming significantly relative to -- relative to the defenses.   Defenses down 8 percent, the cyclicals really on a turn higher.  Does that  -- does that perpetuate in -- in your view or is that -- is that already  pricing in the PMIs that -- that you've just chatted about?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH:  Well, my sense is that it -- it can continue because I  think, you know, people are weary of a (inaudible) here, so if we -- if we  just think about where you've taken that -- that -- that chart from, it  looks to me like that coincides with the turn in -- in interest rates, so  that's really the -- the point at which cyclicals and financials started to  move.  If -- if -- if a turn up in interest rate signals sustainable real  growth and a pick up in -- a sustainable pick up in inflation, then I think  trade has further to run, but people will wait for evidence that cyclicals  are actually delivering the earnings growth that they're expected to  deliver.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Stephen, thank you very much.  Stephen Macklow-Smith, head  of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Mark Hawtin will  stay with us and we'll talk much more about the technology sector in just a  moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Let's talk about technology a bit more then.  Snap, the  creator of the social app Snapchat posted a net loss of $515 million last  year.  We now know that, that's according to the company's IPO perspective.</p><p>CRANNY:  But it's hoping that non-voting investors will see past that  and focus on its vision for the future.  Who better to discern what that  might be than Mark Hawtin, he is from GAM, an investment director there.   Good to have you with us.  So here's the latest offering, Snapchat, three  billion bucks, believe in my dream, believe in my future, I'll make it a  half a billion dollars loss, but I want your money.  Would you put your  money into it given the capital structure that potentially is going to be  offered to market?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Well, I obviously need to see more of the detail.  We've had  some of the information out overnight.  There are clearly a number of  concerns as far as I'm concerned.  When you look at it compared to Facebook  or Twitter, it stacks up more like a -- like Twitter than a Facebook.  It's  interesting that if we look at Facebook at the same kind of stage of  evolution back in 2009, 2010, you know, Facebook was doing two or three  times the growth rate that Snap is doing, and it was profitable.  And I  think one of the biggest concerns for the city will be the lack of  profitability that it's almost mirroring its revenue with its loss, 500  million of revenue, 500 million of losses.  In this market, at this  particular point in the investment cycle, investors don't like that.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes, I was reading some analysis by one of our -- one of our  journalist that says as a private company Snap has been benefitted from a  funding environment that valued growth over profitability.  Does that  change or is the -- even -- or even public market quite forgiving of the  profitability now from what you've just said?</p><p>HAWTIN:  No, I think the public markets are very unforgiving at the  moment as far as profitability is concerned.  There was a very hot IPO  about a -- about a year and half ago, FireEye, very similar type of  profile, half a billion dollars of losses.  They reported last night,  missed, stock down 20 percent.  The market is not happy with companies that  -- that lose money at the moment.</p><p>CRANNY:  Which -- you've touched on it which is Amazon, with Amazon  numbers overnight, and -- and it's interesting, you see Bezos is again,  going for growth, growth, growth.  Operating income in the current quarter  will be quarter to $900 million less than it was a year ago.  So you're --  he's going after revenue growth and he's spending more money on capital  expenditure at the expense of profitability, is that a warning sign for  you?  What did you make of the -- of the notes last night?</p><p>HAWTIN:  OK.  So in the case of Amazon, I'm less concerned.  They are  profitable, they're generating lots of cash, that's the key, we want to see  companies that don't need to draw on the capital markets to grow, they can  do it from within their own cash resources which Amazon can clearly do.   For me, Amazon is the leading disruptor amongst the big tech companies at  the moment.  You know, if you look at CS a few weeks ago, everybody was  talking about Alexa, about artificial intelligence.  It's an Amazon  product.</p><p>EDWARDS:  This is the box that you can talk to.</p><p>HAWTIN:  It's the box you can talk to, exactly.</p><p>CRANNY:  I want one of those.</p><p>HAWTIN:  It's an Amazon product (inaudible) solve all your problems,  Manus.  So I think that, you know, it's really important to look at Amazon  in that context and also, to look at it not just as a retailer, you know,  it's very much dominated now by the Amazon web services business and by the  third-party retail business, providing the platform for other retailers,  not just its own first-party business.</p><p>EDWARDS:  I'm very interested in the role of India for the tech sector  at the moment because we've seen Amazon talking about India and the  opportunities there, continue to push into that new big frontier for  Amazon, and then we have a story also on the Bloomberg about Apple  announcing production facilities over in India.  This is a big frontier  market -- or not frontier market, sorry, this is a big market that they  want to get into.  Apple is not as big a player as they want to be, and  yet, this is a time when politically, perhaps these businesses are being  encouraged to think more about growth in the United States.  How do they  manage that temptation of India, the -- the political reality at home?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Well, I think that it's clearly a fine balance.  I think  India is going to be a huge market, but I think it's going to take a long  time to develop.  It'll take a lot longer than China.  It will be a lot  longer before we see Indian consumers buying smartphones in the way they --  they do in China.  At the same time, they've obviously got to balance the  requirements and the need that's being put on them by the Trump  administration, and Amazon, two, three weeks ago announced that they would  create the next 18 months, a hundred thousand jobs in America, so they're  balancing both sides.</p><p>CRANNY:  Just looking at the Facebook numbers, you mentioned China,  1.9 billion unique users, and the topline of your note is 700 million of  those happened to be in ...</p><p>HAWTIN:  China.</p><p>CRANNY:  ... China.  So there's a couple of issues at play here, one  is the China effect on Facebook, and two, have we hit peak mobile  advertising revenue for Facebook?  Discuss.</p><p>HAWTIN:  Taking the last point first, absolutely not.  You know, the  global advertising market is a 600 billion-dollar market.  If we ex out  China, it's about $500 billion.  Facebook has a mere 5 percent of that.   The targeting that Facebook is able to achieve with its size.  You know,  China has almost half of the internet population on its platform, so its  ability to target and use its network effect is so strong that it can take  a much, much bigger share.  So it's not about whether Facebook can grow by  another 20 or 50 percent, it's about how Facebook can grow by two or three,  or four times more than it is now.</p><p>EDWARDS:  So it hardly started.  A business the size of Facebook and  the -- the way it feels like just part of the establishment, you say it's  hardly started, really.</p><p>HAWTIN:  I think this, and it's really interesting, the sequential  growth in monthly users of Facebook was faster off -- off a -- almost two  billion user-base, then snap chat of a hundred and fifty million.</p><p>CRANNY:  Yes, that's a -- that's a passionate call.  But the next  thing for Facebook though is this, isn't it a -- if -- if we're going to go  three four times, right?  Then we got to be prepared, if you are an  investor in it to say, right, he's going to spend a lot of money on  artificial intelligence, on growing the next YouTube, do you just buy  Netflix, what does he do to create -- what's he going to do?  What -- what  is Facebook going to do to become, you know, the TV all-consuming, all  content?  What's he going to spend?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Well, I mean, they're already spending a lot of money and --  and still, they have 64 percent operating margins.  I mean, if they were  going for -- for profitability, they could probably have 75, 80 percent  operating margins.  So again, it's a balance, and I think they respect  their investors, they balance the needs of growing the company against the  needs of the investor base, perhaps more so than -- than people give them  credit for.  So they will spend, they can afford to spend a huge amount of  money given their size, without necessarily denting profitability too much.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Does has the fake news story stick to them at all, perhaps,  not materially, you know, from an investor's perspective, but does that run  and run or has that gone away?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Honestly, I think it's a sideshow.  I think that, you know,  it's -- it's impossible to vet every news story.  You know, if -- if you  look at it in terms of the number of stories that get put up or the number  of Tweets in the case of Twitter, you can't vet that, it's just part of  doing the business.</p><p>CRANNY:  Are you as bullish on Apple?  Because let's be frank, I mean,  they -- they don't have as many ponies in the stable, do they?</p><p>HAWTIN:  No.  So I'm less bullish on Apple.  If I was a pension fund  investor, I'd be a very happy holder of Apple.  It's got a 10 percent free  cash flow yield, pays a nice dividend.  Its last quarter suggests that the  iPhone declined has -- has been halted, so we got a good stable platform.   However, longer-term, I am concerned about their ability to maintain that  platform.  If we look back 15 years, the -- you know, Nokia had a 30  percent at the mobile phone market, Ericsson 10, Motorola 15, where are  they now?  Nowhere.  Blackberry, nowhere.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Do they -- do they have to open up their ecosystem then, do  you think that pressure mounts?</p><p>HAWTIN:  It's a really tricky one because I would say yes.  I mean,  the world is going more open, however, if they were to open up their  ecosystem, they then really put the -- put the price point of their -- of  their products at a more -- at a more vulnerable position.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Mark, thank you so much for your time this morning.  Mark  Hawtin, investment director at GAM joining us here in the studio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Joining us now, Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. Stephen, great to see you on the program, lots to cover with you, we'll start with Europe. So tell us about your -- your valuation story around Europe, it's cheap versus the U.S., it's cheap as it ever get. Is that justified by the political risk or not? Discuss.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: My sense is that -- that markets are -- are over aware of the political risk, and I think the reason for that is they've taken a straight line through what was perceived to be a shock in the U.K. referendum and a shock in the U.S. election, and said, you know, there is an insurgent populist movement in place, every single election's going to go the same way, but I just don't think that that's justified by what we're seeing in opinion polls. So the referendum in the U.K. was within the margin of error for opinion polls. Trump, despite winning enough votes in the Electoral College to be president, lost the electoral vote, so the -- the opinion polls actually matched (inaudible) margin of error onto the outturn in the election. The Italian referendum reflected what's happening in the opinion polls, so now we run it forward. Geert Wilders is in the lead in the opinion polls in the Netherlands, but without enough to form majority governments or even the coalition, and you know, it -- therefore, either his message will be tempered, or there will be a weak centrist government opposing him. And then you go to France where Marine Le Pen is a brilliant campaigner and she's done a great deal to detoxify the -- the (inaudible) brand but, she is finding it very difficult to break through that kind of 27 percent (inaudible) in the opinion polls which suggests that she can win in the second round.</p><p>CRANNY: You have some I would say, quite bullish calls. You say it's a good -- a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the numbers, it's going to help the overall earnings, and you're expecting earnings to rise by about 8 percent this year, and dividend plays will be critical as well.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, what we're saying is that starting yield is attractive, so you know, you're starting with a level yield of around three, but then, if the market doesn't re-rate, then you would get the (inaudible) on top of that and that will give you your title return, and that's reasonably good outturn particularly considering what happened in Europe in the last -- in the last seven years.</p><p>EDWARDS: Let me get your thoughts on this story that's -- that's across the Bloomberg this morning, looks as if it's going to develop throughout the day. Trump halting the Obama Fiduciary Rule, ordering a review of Dodd-Frank. I mean, that shouldn't surprise in the sense that he's always talked about reducing regulation, and he'd been critical of some of the regulation in the financial services actually, that have been brought in by the Obama administration. This sounds like a precursor for something to come, this will excite U.S. bank stocks perhaps, or -- or U.S. markets more generally if it signifies a reduced regulation approach.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Yes. I mean, it's in line as you say, with what he said about deregulation. I think President Trump has an entrepreneurized (ph) mindset, he wants to reduce the barriers to doing business and he perceives any kind of regulation as a barrier to that. I think that -- that what he said last night is -- is actually, you should take that in line with the letters written by Patrick McHenry to Janet Yellen on the 31st of January, pointing out the way in which the Fed have been cooperating with international regulatory bodies to the perceived disadvantage of American banks and, you know, demanding that -- that they (inaudible) more in line with the administration's thinking. So yes, you know, I think that -- that it's all part of the same ...</p><p>EDWARDS: What has the -- what has the Fed been agreeing to that the U.S. government ...</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, the letter referred to membership of the Financial Stabilities Board -- the Financial Stability Board chaired by Mark Carney, and, yes, I think it referred to bank and international (inaudible) as well, so basically, to hire regulatory capital requirements.</p><p>CRANNY: But is that a case of the administration politicizing the Fed? I mean, is the Fed -- a letter like that suggests to me, the Federal Reserve is no longer independent.</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, it's -- it's ...</p><p>CRANNY: Or it's beginning that road?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: It's -- it's -- it's Capitol Hill making its views felt to -- to -- to the chair of the Fed. What the Fed does about it is the Fed's business. You know, the Fed is still independent.</p><p>EDWARDS: Would this be -- I mean, your -- your focus is on Europe of course, Stephen, but some of the excitement around the Trump trade have been around lower taxes and reduced regulation, is this going to be something that cause markets to think, \"OK, it's not all about protectionism, we're back on that Trump trade equities go higher,\" technically but in the longer term?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: I'm going to pick you up on this phrase of the Trump trade because I don't think that this is all about President Trump, I think that, you know, what -- what comes out -- the news headlines are dominated by, you know, the latest announcements form the administration, but the -- the improvement in the equity markets and the move towards a reflationary trade, it started in bond markets in June, so, you know, that was when we first saw people rotating in cyclicals in the (inaudible) defenses, and looking more favorably on financials.</p><p>EDWARDS: Stephen, thank you so much for your thoughts this morning. Stephen Macklow-Smith stays with us here on Daybreak Europe. Up next, we'll talk more about Trump and jobs.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CRANNY: Let's bring in -- back in Stephen Macklow-Smith from JPMorgan Asset Management, and we've got another guest with us, we got Mark -- Mark Hawtin from GAM. Great to have you both with us. Two very diverse interests, technology, obviously, you're hot to drop. Stephen, in terms of these markets, we've picked up on it before -- before the break, you said look, you're fed up with people talking about a Trump trade, but -- I'm paraphrasing. But you said that the ignition for renewed enthusiasm was already there, so the foundation today will be his first jobs report. What's important for you today and the day this week?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Basically, I think the most important releases this week have been the PMIs in Europe, so being parochial (ph)because I'm a European strategist, but they indicated that things are still, you know, that things are still improving, real growth is -- is -- is on track to be satisfactory, it's not going to shoot the lights out this year, it will be satisfactory, and everything we're seeing in -- in bond markets and 5 Year 5 Year Forward inflation swaps suggests that inflation's picking up as well. That leads to nominal growth, that's good for companies, so I think that's -- that's the most important thing by way of background for us.</p><p>EDWARDS: Mark, when you look at what's happening in the United States at the moment, the arrival of a new president (inaudible) there's lots of politics, there's been upsetting parts to Silicon Valley, isn't it? There's been a lot of fallout between the two. Just looking at his plans as we know them so far, Donald Trump's plans, what is it that he is doing that is going to have most impact on the universe that you look at? Is it around immigration or is it other policies?</p><p>HAWTIN: I think the most headline-grabbing policy is around immigration in terms of these companies, we're going to get the talent that they require. A lot of the programmers and software engineers. But I think funnily enough, we're not going to see as much of an issue as perhaps, the market at first thought. You know, it's all about deregulation with Trump, but in the case of technology, people have been talking more about regulation and some of the big tech names in the fourth quarter of last year, Amazon, Facebook for example, were both down 10 percent after Trump was elected, and I think that's a big overreaction. So I think the regulation will be quite light touch, and actually, things will be fine.</p><p>CRANNY: Certainly from CEO level though, the -- the stage is set for, and I'm being generous here, a moderate level of confrontation is how it would sound at this juncture. They're not bedfellows are they at the moment?</p><p>HAWTIN: No, but you know, there seem to be many bedfellows at all where Trump's concerned, I mean, confrontation is his style, and I think it will be, you know, an evolutionary process, he'll manage the relationship with Silicon Valley. It's an incredibly valuable part of the economy for the United States, so he's not going to want to upset that.</p><p>EDWARDS: But Stephen, coming back to you on the -- on the European side of things or measuring up the Europe versus the United States, where are you focused then in -- in Europe at the moment in terms of your equity strategy? You say that Europe's undervalued compared to the United States, where is that screaming at the loudest?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, I mean, Europe has -- is -- is trading at a big price-to-book discount for the United States, partly because European profitability has -- has been very unsatisfactory for seven years, and there's been kind of rolling earnings recession. You know, it -- it -- it went through most of the market in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, and then, financials were under pressure, and then you have commodities and energy. And at the moment, you know, we're seeing a relatively sustained recovery across -- across the world, so you're seeing a pick up in growth in emerging markets, pick up in growth in Europe. U.S. is still growing reasonably well, and that's very -- a very good background for profitability, so we think profitability can recover from here, and therefore, we're trying to play that through areas of the market with more exposure to economic growth, so it's classically cyclicals, and that's ...</p><p>CRANNY: And that's what we've got here for you, we got the cyclicals outperforming significantly relative to -- relative to the defenses. Defenses down 8 percent, the cyclicals really on a turn higher. Does that -- does that perpetuate in -- in your view or is that -- is that already pricing in the PMIs that -- that you've just chatted about?</p><p>MACKLOW-SMITH: Well, my sense is that it -- it can continue because I think, you know, people are weary of a (inaudible) here, so if we -- if we just think about where you've taken that -- that -- that chart from, it looks to me like that coincides with the turn in -- in interest rates, so that's really the -- the point at which cyclicals and financials started to move. If -- if -- if a turn up in interest rate signals sustainable real growth and a pick up in -- a sustainable pick up in inflation, then I think trade has further to run, but people will wait for evidence that cyclicals are actually delivering the earnings growth that they're expected to deliver.</p><p>EDWARDS: Stephen, thank you very much. Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. Mark Hawtin will stay with us and we'll talk much more about the technology sector in just a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Let's talk about technology a bit more then. Snap, the creator of the social app Snapchat posted a net loss of $515 million last year. We now know that, that's according to the company's IPO perspective.</p><p>CRANNY: But it's hoping that non-voting investors will see past that and focus on its vision for the future. Who better to discern what that might be than Mark Hawtin, he is from GAM, an investment director there. Good to have you with us. So here's the latest offering, Snapchat, three billion bucks, believe in my dream, believe in my future, I'll make it a half a billion dollars loss, but I want your money. Would you put your money into it given the capital structure that potentially is going to be offered to market?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I obviously need to see more of the detail. We've had some of the information out overnight. There are clearly a number of concerns as far as I'm concerned. When you look at it compared to Facebook or Twitter, it stacks up more like a -- like Twitter than a Facebook. It's interesting that if we look at Facebook at the same kind of stage of evolution back in 2009, 2010, you know, Facebook was doing two or three times the growth rate that Snap is doing, and it was profitable. And I think one of the biggest concerns for the city will be the lack of profitability that it's almost mirroring its revenue with its loss, 500 million of revenue, 500 million of losses. In this market, at this particular point in the investment cycle, investors don't like that.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes, I was reading some analysis by one of our -- one of our journalist that says as a private company Snap has been benefitted from a funding environment that valued growth over profitability. Does that change or is the -- even -- or even public market quite forgiving of the profitability now from what you've just said?</p><p>HAWTIN: No, I think the public markets are very unforgiving at the moment as far as profitability is concerned. There was a very hot IPO about a -- about a year and half ago, FireEye, very similar type of profile, half a billion dollars of losses. They reported last night, missed, stock down 20 percent. The market is not happy with companies that -- that lose money at the moment.</p><p>CRANNY: Which -- you've touched on it which is Amazon, with Amazon numbers overnight, and -- and it's interesting, you see Bezos is again, going for growth, growth, growth. Operating income in the current quarter will be quarter to $900 million less than it was a year ago. So you're -- he's going after revenue growth and he's spending more money on capital expenditure at the expense of profitability, is that a warning sign for you? What did you make of the -- of the notes last night?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So in the case of Amazon, I'm less concerned. They are profitable, they're generating lots of cash, that's the key, we want to see companies that don't need to draw on the capital markets to grow, they can do it from within their own cash resources which Amazon can clearly do. For me, Amazon is the leading disruptor amongst the big tech companies at the moment. You know, if you look at CS a few weeks ago, everybody was talking about Alexa, about artificial intelligence. It's an Amazon product.</p><p>EDWARDS: This is the box that you can talk to.</p><p>HAWTIN: It's the box you can talk to, exactly.</p><p>CRANNY: I want one of those.</p><p>HAWTIN: It's an Amazon product (inaudible) solve all your problems, Manus. So I think that, you know, it's really important to look at Amazon in that context and also, to look at it not just as a retailer, you know, it's very much dominated now by the Amazon web services business and by the third-party retail business, providing the platform for other retailers, not just its own first-party business.</p><p>EDWARDS: I'm very interested in the role of India for the tech sector at the moment because we've seen Amazon talking about India and the opportunities there, continue to push into that new big frontier for Amazon, and then we have a story also on the Bloomberg about Apple announcing production facilities over in India. This is a big frontier market -- or not frontier market, sorry, this is a big market that they want to get into. Apple is not as big a player as they want to be, and yet, this is a time when politically, perhaps these businesses are being encouraged to think more about growth in the United States. How do they manage that temptation of India, the -- the political reality at home?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think that it's clearly a fine balance. I think India is going to be a huge market, but I think it's going to take a long time to develop. It'll take a lot longer than China. It will be a lot longer before we see Indian consumers buying smartphones in the way they -- they do in China. At the same time, they've obviously got to balance the requirements and the need that's being put on them by the Trump administration, and Amazon, two, three weeks ago announced that they would create the next 18 months, a hundred thousand jobs in America, so they're balancing both sides.</p><p>CRANNY: Just looking at the Facebook numbers, you mentioned China, 1.9 billion unique users, and the topline of your note is 700 million of those happened to be in ...</p><p>HAWTIN: China.</p><p>CRANNY: ... China. So there's a couple of issues at play here, one is the China effect on Facebook, and two, have we hit peak mobile advertising revenue for Facebook? Discuss.</p><p>HAWTIN: Taking the last point first, absolutely not. You know, the global advertising market is a 600 billion-dollar market. If we ex out China, it's about $500 billion. Facebook has a mere 5 percent of that. The targeting that Facebook is able to achieve with its size. You know, China has almost half of the internet population on its platform, so its ability to target and use its network effect is so strong that it can take a much, much bigger share. So it's not about whether Facebook can grow by another 20 or 50 percent, it's about how Facebook can grow by two or three, or four times more than it is now.</p><p>EDWARDS: So it hardly started. A business the size of Facebook and the -- the way it feels like just part of the establishment, you say it's hardly started, really.</p><p>HAWTIN: I think this, and it's really interesting, the sequential growth in monthly users of Facebook was faster off -- off a -- almost two billion user-base, then snap chat of a hundred and fifty million.</p><p>CRANNY: Yes, that's a -- that's a passionate call. But the next thing for Facebook though is this, isn't it a -- if -- if we're going to go three four times, right? Then we got to be prepared, if you are an investor in it to say, right, he's going to spend a lot of money on artificial intelligence, on growing the next YouTube, do you just buy Netflix, what does he do to create -- what's he going to do? What -- what is Facebook going to do to become, you know, the TV all-consuming, all content? What's he going to spend?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I mean, they're already spending a lot of money and -- and still, they have 64 percent operating margins. I mean, if they were going for -- for profitability, they could probably have 75, 80 percent operating margins. So again, it's a balance, and I think they respect their investors, they balance the needs of growing the company against the needs of the investor base, perhaps more so than -- than people give them credit for. So they will spend, they can afford to spend a huge amount of money given their size, without necessarily denting profitability too much.</p><p>EDWARDS: Does has the fake news story stick to them at all, perhaps, not materially, you know, from an investor's perspective, but does that run and run or has that gone away?</p><p>HAWTIN: Honestly, I think it's a sideshow. I think that, you know, it's -- it's impossible to vet every news story. You know, if -- if you look at it in terms of the number of stories that get put up or the number of Tweets in the case of Twitter, you can't vet that, it's just part of doing the business.</p><p>CRANNY: Are you as bullish on Apple? Because let's be frank, I mean, they -- they don't have as many ponies in the stable, do they?</p><p>HAWTIN: No. So I'm less bullish on Apple. If I was a pension fund investor, I'd be a very happy holder of Apple. It's got a 10 percent free cash flow yield, pays a nice dividend. Its last quarter suggests that the iPhone declined has -- has been halted, so we got a good stable platform. However, longer-term, I am concerned about their ability to maintain that platform. If we look back 15 years, the -- you know, Nokia had a 30 percent at the mobile phone market, Ericsson 10, Motorola 15, where are they now? Nowhere. Blackberry, nowhere.</p><p>EDWARDS: Do they -- do they have to open up their ecosystem then, do you think that pressure mounts?</p><p>HAWTIN: It's a really tricky one because I would say yes. I mean, the world is going more open, however, if they were to open up their ecosystem, they then really put the -- put the price point of their -- of their products at a more -- at a more vulnerable position.</p><p>EDWARDS: Mark, thank you so much for your time this morning.

Joining us now, Stephen Macklow- Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. Stephen, great to see you on the program, lots to cover with you, we'll start with Europe.  So tell us about your -- your valuation story around Europe, it's cheap versus the U.S., it's cheap as it ever get.  Is that justified by the political risk or not?  Discuss.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  My sense is that -- that markets are -- are over aware of the political risk, and I think the reason for that is they've taken a straight line through what was perceived to be a shock in the U.K. referendum and a shock in the U.S. election, and said, you know, there is an insurgent populist movement in place, every single election's going to go the same way, but I just don't think that that's justified by what we're seeing in opinion polls.  So the referendum in the U.K. was within the margin of error for opinion polls.  Trump, despite winning enough votes in the Electoral College to be president, lost the electoral vote, so the -- the opinion polls actually matched (inaudible) margin of error onto the outturn in the election.  The Italian referendum reflected what's happening in the opinion polls, so now we run it forward.  Geert Wilders is in the lead in the opinion polls in the Netherlands, but without enough to form majority governments or even the coalition, and you know, it -- therefore, either his message will be tempered, or there will be a weak centrist government opposing him.  And then you go to France where Marine Le Pen is a brilliant campaigner and she's done a great deal to detoxify the -- the (inaudible) brand but, she is finding it very difficult to break through that kind of 27 percent (inaudible) in the opinion polls which suggests that she can win in the second round.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  You have some I would say, quite bullish calls.  You say it's a good -- a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the numbers, it's going to help the overall earnings, and you're expecting earnings to rise by about 8 percent this year, and dividend plays will be critical as well.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, what we're saying is that starting yield is attractive, so you know, you're starting with a level yield of around three, but then, if the market doesn't re-rate, then you would get the (inaudible) on top of that and that will give you your title return, and that's reasonably good outturn particularly considering what happened in Europe in the last -- in the last seven years.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Let me get your thoughts on this story that's -- that's across the Bloomberg this morning, looks as if it's going to develop throughout the day.  Trump halting the Obama Fiduciary Rule, ordering a review of Dodd-Frank.  I mean, that shouldn't surprise in the sense that he's always talked about reducing regulation, and he'd been critical of some of the regulation in the financial services actually, that have been brought in by the Obama administration.  This sounds like a precursor for something to come, this will excite U.S. bank stocks perhaps, or -- or U.S. markets more generally if it signifies a reduced regulation approach.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Yes.  I mean, it's in line as you say, with what he said about deregulation.  I think President Trump has an entrepreneurized (ph) mindset, he wants to reduce the barriers to doing business and he perceives any kind of regulation as a barrier to that.  I think that -- that what he said last night is -- is actually, you should take that in line with the letters written by Patrick McHenry to Janet Yellen on the 31st of January, pointing out the way in which the Fed have been cooperating with international regulatory bodies to the perceived disadvantage of American banks and, you know, demanding that -- that they (inaudible) more in line with the administration's thinking.  So yes, you know, I think that -- that it's all part of the same ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  What has the -- what has the Fed been agreeing to that the U.S. government ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, the letter referred to membership of the Financial Stabilities Board -- the Financial Stability Board chaired by Mark Carney, and, yes, I think it referred to bank and international (inaudible) as well, so basically, to hire regulatory capital requirements.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  But is that a case of the administration politicizing the Fed?  I mean, is the Fed -- a letter like that suggests to me, the Federal Reserve is no longer independent.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, it's -- it's ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Or it's beginning that road?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  It's -- it's -- it's Capitol Hill making its views felt to -- to -- to the chair of the Fed.  What the Fed does about it is the Fed's business.  You know, the Fed is still independent.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Would this be -- I mean, your -- your focus is on Europe of course, Stephen, but some of the excitement around the Trump trade have been around lower taxes and reduced regulation, is this going to be something that cause markets to think, \"OK, it's not all about protectionism, we're back on that Trump trade equities go higher,\" technically but in the longer term?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  I'm going to pick you up on this phrase of the Trump trade because I don't think that this is all about President Trump, I think that, you know, what -- what comes out -- the news headlines are dominated by, you know, the latest announcements form the administration, but the -- the improvement in the equity markets and the move towards a reflationary trade, it started in bond markets in June, so, you know, that was when we first saw people rotating in cyclicals in the (inaudible) defenses, and looking more favorably on financials.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Stephen, thank you so much for your thoughts this morning.  Stephen Macklow-Smith stays with us here on Daybreak Europe. Up next, we'll talk more about Trump and jobs.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Let's bring in -- back in Stephen Macklow-Smith from JPMorgan Asset Management, and we've got another guest with us, we got Mark -- Mark Hawtin from GAM.  Great to have you both with us.  Two very diverse interests, technology, obviously, you're hot to drop. Stephen, in terms of these markets, we've picked up on it before -- before the break, you said look, you're fed up with people talking about a Trump trade, but -- I'm paraphrasing.  But you said that the ignition for renewed enthusiasm was already there, so the foundation today will be his first jobs report.  What's important for you today and the day this week?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Basically, I think the most important releases this week have been the PMIs in Europe, so being parochial (ph)because I'm a European strategist, but they indicated that things are still, you know, that things are still improving, real growth is -- is -- is on track to be satisfactory, it's not going to shoot the lights out this year, it will be satisfactory, and everything we're seeing in -- in bond markets and 5 Year 5 Year Forward inflation swaps suggests that inflation's picking up as well.  That leads to nominal growth, that's good for companies, so I think that's -- that's the most important thing by way of background for us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Mark, when you look at what's happening in the United States at the moment, the arrival of a new president (inaudible) there's lots of politics, there's been upsetting parts to Silicon Valley, isn't it?  There's been a lot of fallout between the two. Just looking at his plans as we know them so far, Donald Trump's plans, what is it that he is doing that is going to have most impact on the universe that you look at?  Is it around immigration or is it other policies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I think the most headline-grabbing policy is around immigration in terms of these companies, we're going to get the talent that they require.  A lot of the programmers and software engineers. But I think funnily enough, we're not going to see as much of an issue as perhaps, the market at first thought.  You know, it's all about deregulation with Trump, but in the case of technology, people have been talking more about regulation and some of the big tech names in the fourth quarter of last year, Amazon, Facebook for example, were both down 10 percent after Trump was elected, and I think that's a big overreaction.  So I think the regulation will be quite light touch, and actually, things will be fine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Certainly from CEO level though, the -- the stage is set for, and I'm being generous here, a moderate level of confrontation is how it would sound at this juncture.  They're not bedfellows are they at the moment?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  No, but you know, there seem to be many bedfellows at all where Trump's concerned, I mean, confrontation is his style, and I think it will be, you know, an evolutionary process, he'll manage the relationship with Silicon Valley.  It's an incredibly valuable part of the economy for the United States, so he's not going to want to upset that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  But Stephen, coming back to you on the -- on the European side of things or measuring up the Europe versus the United States, where are you focused then in -- in Europe at the moment in terms of your equity strategy?  You say that Europe's undervalued compared to the United States, where is that screaming at the loudest?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, Europe has -- is -- is trading at a big price-to-book discount for the United States, partly because European profitability has -- has been very unsatisfactory for seven years, and there's been kind of rolling earnings recession.  You know, it -- it -- it went through most of the market in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, and then, financials were under pressure, and then you have commodities and energy.  And at the moment, you know, we're seeing a relatively sustained recovery across -- across the world, so you're seeing a pick up in growth in emerging markets, pick up in growth in Europe.  U.S. is still growing reasonably well, and that's very -- a very good background for profitability, so we think profitability can recover from here, and therefore, we're trying to play that through areas of the market with more exposure to economic growth, so it's classically cyclicals, and that's ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  And that's what we've got here for you, we got the cyclicals outperforming significantly relative to -- relative to the defenses.  Defenses down 8 percent, the cyclicals really on a turn higher.  Does that -- does that perpetuate in -- in your view or is that -- is that already pricing in the PMIs that -- that you've just chatted about?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MACKLOW-SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, my sense is that it -- it can continue because I think, you know, people are weary of a (inaudible) here, so if we -- if we just think about where you've taken that -- that -- that chart from, it looks to me like that coincides with the turn in -- in interest rates, so that's really the -- the point at which cyclicals and financials started to move.  If -- if -- if a turn up in interest rate signals sustainable real growth and a pick up in -- a sustainable pick up in inflation, then I think trade has further to run, but people will wait for evidence that cyclicals are actually delivering the earnings growth that they're expected to deliver.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Stephen, thank you very much.  Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Mark Hawtin will stay with us and we'll talk much more about the technology sector in just a moment.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Let's talk about technology a bit more then.  Snap, the creator of the social app Snapchat posted a net loss of $515 million last year.  We now know that, that's according to the company's IPO perspective.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  But it's hoping that non-voting investors will see past that and focus on its vision for the future.  Who better to discern what that might be than Mark Hawtin, he is from GAM, an investment director there.  Good to have you with us.  So here's the latest offering, Snapchat, three billion bucks, believe in my dream, believe in my future, I'll make it a half a billion dollars loss, but I want your money.  Would you put your money into it given the capital structure that potentially is going to be offered to market?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I obviously need to see more of the detail.  We've had some of the information out overnight.  There are clearly a number of concerns as far as I'm concerned.  When you look at it compared to Facebook or Twitter, it stacks up more like a -- like Twitter than a Facebook.  It's interesting that if we look at Facebook at the same kind of stage of evolution back in 2009, 2010, you know, Facebook was doing two or three times the growth rate that Snap is doing, and it was profitable.  And I think one of the biggest concerns for the city will be the lack of profitability that it's almost mirroring its revenue with its loss, 500 million of revenue, 500 million of losses. In this market, at this particular point in the investment cycle, investors don't like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes, I was reading some analysis by one of our -- one of our journalist that says as a private company Snap has been benefitted from a funding environment that valued growth over profitability.  Does that change or is the -- even -- or even public market quite forgiving of the profitability now from what you've just said?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  No, I think the public markets are very unforgiving at the moment as far as profitability is concerned.  There was a very hot IPO about a -- about a year and half ago, FireEye, very similar type of profile, half a billion dollars of losses.  They reported last night, missed, stock down 20 percent.  The market is not happy with companies that -- that lose money at the moment.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Which -- you've touched on it which is Amazon, with Amazon numbers overnight, and -- and it's interesting, you see Bezos is again, going for growth, growth, growth.  Operating income in the current quarter will be quarter to $900 million less than it was a year ago.  So you're -- he's going after revenue growth and he's spending more money on capital expenditure at the expense of profitability, is that a warning sign for you?  What did you make of the -- of the notes last night?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  OK.  So in the case of Amazon, I'm less concerned.  They are profitable, they're generating lots of cash, that's the key, we want to see companies that don't need to draw on the capital markets to grow, they can do it from within their own cash resources which Amazon can clearly do.  For me, Amazon is the leading disruptor amongst the big tech companies at the moment.  You know, if you look at CS a few weeks ago, everybody was talking about Alexa, about artificial intelligence.  It's an Amazon product.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  This is the box that you can talk to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  It's the box you can talk to, exactly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  I want one of those.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  It's an Amazon product (inaudible) solve all your problems, Manus.  So I think that, you know, it's really important to look at Amazon in that context and also, to look at it not just as a retailer, you know, it's very much dominated now by the Amazon web services business and by the third-party retail business, providing the platform for other retailers, not just its own first-party business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  I'm very interested in the role of India for the tech sector at the moment because we've seen Amazon talking about India and the opportunities there, continue to push into that new big frontier for Amazon, and then we have a story also on the Bloomberg about Apple announcing production facilities over in India.  This is a big frontier market -- or not frontier market, sorry, this is a big market that they want to get into.  Apple is not as big a player as they want to be, and yet, this is a time when politically, perhaps these businesses are being encouraged to think more about growth in the United States.  How do they manage that temptation of India, the -- the political reality at home?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I think that it's clearly a fine balance.  I think India is going to be a huge market, but I think it's going to take a long time to develop.  It'll take a lot longer than China.  It will be a lot longer before we see Indian consumers buying smartphones in the way they -- they do in China.  At the same time, they've obviously got to balance the requirements and the need that's being put on them by the Trump administration, and Amazon, two, three weeks ago announced that they would create the next 18 months, a hundred thousand jobs in America, so they're balancing both sides.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Just looking at the Facebook numbers, you mentioned China, 1.9 billion unique users, and the topline of your note is 700 million of those happened to be in ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  China.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  ... China.  So there's a couple of issues at play here, one is the China effect on Facebook, and two, have we hit peak mobile advertising revenue for Facebook?  Discuss.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Taking the last point first, absolutely not.  You know, the global advertising market is a 600 billion-dollar market.  If we ex out China, it's about $500 billion.  Facebook has a mere 5 percent of that.  The targeting that Facebook is able to achieve with its size.  You know, China has almost half of the internet population on its platform, so its ability to target and use its network effect is so strong that it can take a much, much bigger share.  So it's not about whether Facebook can grow by another 20 or 50 percent, it's about how Facebook can grow by two or three, or four times more than it is now.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So it hardly started.  A business the size of Facebook and the -- the way it feels like just part of the establishment, you say it's hardly started, really.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I think this, and it's really interesting, the sequential growth in monthly users of Facebook was faster off -- off a -- almost two billion user-base, then snap chat of a hundred and fifty million.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Yes, that's a -- that's a passionate call.  But the next thing for Facebook though is this, isn't it a -- if -- if we're going to go three four times, right?  Then we got to be prepared, if you are an investor in it to say, right, he's going to spend a lot of money on artificial intelligence, on growing the next YouTube, do you just buy Netflix, what does he do to create -- what's he going to do?  What -- what is Facebook going to do to become, you know, the TV all- consuming, all content?  What's he going to spend?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, they're already spending a lot of money and -- and still, they have 64 percent operating margins.  I mean, if they were going for -- for profitability, they could probably have 75, 80 percent operating margins.  So again, it's a balance, and I think they respect their investors, they balance the needs of growing the company against the needs of the investor base, perhaps more so than -- than people give them credit for.  So they will spend, they can afford to spend a huge amount of money given their size, without necessarily denting profitability too much.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Does has the fake news story stick to them at all, perhaps, not materially, you know, from an investor's perspective, but does that run and run or has that gone away?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Honestly, I think it's a sideshow.  I think that, you know, it's -- it's impossible to vet every news story.  You know, if -- if you look at it in terms of the number of stories that get put up or the number of Tweets in the case of Twitter, you can't vet that, it's just part of doing the business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRANNY</emphasis>:  Are you as bullish on Apple?  Because let's be frank, I mean, they -- they don't have as many ponies in the stable, do they?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  No.  So I'm less bullish on Apple.  If I was a pension fund investor, I'd be a very happy holder of Apple.  It's got a 10 percent free cash flow yield, pays a nice dividend.  Its last quarter suggests that the iPhone declined has -- has been halted, so we got a good stable platform.  However, longer-term, I am concerned about their ability to maintain that platform.  If we look back 15 years, the -- you know, Nokia had a 30 percent at the mobile phone market, Ericsson 10, Motorola 15, where are they now?  Nowhere.  Blackberry, nowhere.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Do they -- do they have to open up their ecosystem then, do you think that pressure mounts?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  It's a really tricky one because I would say yes.  I mean, the world is going more open, however, if they were to open up their ecosystem, they then really put the -- put the price point of their -- of their products at a more -- at a more vulnerable position.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Mark, thank you so much for your time this morning.

At last year's conference, Galloway correctly predicted that Amazon would acquire Whole Foods and that hacking, phishing schemes and ransomware would reach crisis proportions - proven in 2017 when Equifax, Uber, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Chipotle were all hacked.</p><p>Galloway claimed that he risks losing some of his clients - companies represented by L2 - over his idea of breaking up big technology.</p><p>\"Regardless of who our clients are, we provide unbiased research on how brands perform across four dimensions of digital - site and e-commerce, digital marketing, social media and mobile,\" Galloway said in an email. \"Similarly, I make unbiased opinions rooted in my own research and experience working with, working for and observing these firms.\"</p><p>A few of the notable predictions Galloway made for 2018 are that Amazon will pass Apple in value; cryptocurrencies will crash by over 50 percent in a month; Twitter, Snapchat and Pinterest will be acquired for between 25 and 50 percent of their all-time highs; Amazon will acquire Carrefour or Nordstrom; and that the breakup of big tech companies will begin in Europe or a red state in the U.S.</p><p>Along with these predictions, Galloway revealed the faults of several giant tech companies throughout his speech: Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods crashed market values of grocery businesses much larger than Whole Foods.</p><p>Galloway's attack focussed a lot on the Big Four tech companies -\u00a0Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p>\"They destroy jobs, they avoid taxes and they lie to regulators,\" Galloway said in an email. \"And guess what, the market is failing. The Four are dominating the press and markets, creating a concentration of power that fosters premature death for big companies and infanticide for small firms. Think about which ecosystem would create more jobs and shareholder value, inspire more investment, broaden the tax base and lower rents via increased competition from firms. An ecosystem with Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google? Or an Ecosystem with Amazon, Amazon Web Services, Apple, iTunes, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, YouTube?\"</p><p>Galloway further emphasized at the conference that breaking up big tech corporations is not a form of government overreach but an integral element to revitalizing competitive markets. \u00a0</p><p>\"I believe the main reason that we should break these firms up is that a key trait of capitalism is that the market leads, not government,\" Galloway said. \"A key component of the capitalist economic model is that when markets fail, and they do, we have referees on the field to throw a yellow flag and restore order.\"</p><p>Despite the risk it poses to his business, Galloway said that breaking up big tech is necessary to maintain capitalism.</p><p>\"We should break them up because key to our capitalist way of life is to maintain competition to prevent market failure, as we did by breaking up the railroads and Ma Bell,\" he said. \"This type of intervention is not an attack on capitalism, but full-throated capitalism. It's time.\"</p><p>Email Louise Choi at [email protected]\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He was interviewed by the Mueller team three times.  Steve Bannon joins me now from Rome.  Mr. Bannon it's a pleasure to have you on.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to get to Obamacare a little bit later on but let's start with what the attorney general Barr, according to Chairman Nadler not committing to releasing the full Mueller Report.  Do you think he should, except of course of classified material or Grand Jury proceedings?</p><p>STEVEN BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Look, I think it's obviously up to the attorney general as somebody that was part of the process I think they ought to release it.</p><p>But it's the attorney general's decision.  You know one of the things, Anderson; I think is lost in all of this is -- is President Trump, you know, waived executive privilege.  He waived attorney client privilege.  He had not just Reince Priebus and myself but Don McGahn, the White House Counsel and others.</p><p>I think it was like 500 witnesses, what 2,800 subpoenas.  So the president went out of his way to get all this information out and get it out quickly.  So I would assume that everybody would want to get the full report out to people except for what's classified or what needs to be redacted.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and Lindsey Graham just said today that the president told him directly said, quote, just release it.  I know you thought it was legal but not wise for the president to fire Comey.  </p><p>Given the fact that Mueller has now exonerated the president and those around him when it comes to any kind of collusion or criminal conspiracy with Russia, was smart in retrospect for the president to have been attacking the investigation in the way that he did really for the last two years?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, you know, actually -- I actually used you as example when we talked -- when I talked with the president back in the Oval Office.   I said hey, on the Comey investigation, I said even Anderson Cooper, you know, has got this in the C Block.  </p><p>This was in the spring of 17'.  But you know the president had his own ideas about the job that Comey was doing.  And so he -- he terminated him.  I always said that Mueller, I think's an honorable guy.  </p><p>He's a combat veteran, he's combat marine.  And -- but the president, you know whatever he said on Twitter or whatever he said you know in -- in -- in public declarations or on T.V., the important thing was he told everybody to cooperate and to get it out there like no other president's ever done.</p><p>That's what was stunning.  And in fact I was kind of a critic about how quickly they were releasing information.  I thought it ought to be a little bit more processed.  You know there's 1.2 million documents that were released.</p><p>So I think the president's actions where he was full supportive of the Mueller investigation and that's -- that's why I think it's -- and coming back like it is to kind of exonerate him.</p><p>I actually think it's time to release the documents and let's move on and get on with the work of the country.</p><p>COOPER:  You've been very clear about no collusion all along.  You've been probably less definitive; I think is fair to say when it comes to obstruction of justice.  Were you surprised that Mueller himself did not reach a conclusion or recommendation on that and essentially hand it over to the attorney general to make a -- a conclusion?</p><p>BANNON:  Look -- look, I'm not a lawyer but the way I look at prosecutors either charge or they don't charge.  You know the no exoneration line, to me, I thought was a little bit of a cheap shot and -- and I've been very supportive of the Mueller process.</p><p>Look he -- here's the thing, they took two years, they looked at everything.  It wasn't that I was concerned about an obstruction of justice.  I didn't think there was any.  But you know you go through all these documents and that's why the 18 election, you know, by the democrats getting out there and working so hard, the grassroots democrats winning the House, I said look, what they're going to try to do is weaponize the Mueller report.</p><p>And to -- and to use that as the beginning under Nadler's -- Jerry Nadler's JudiCIAry Committee to start kind of impeachment hearings and impeachment process.  I actually think that this -- what happened is with this report; it looks like that's all going to be put to bed.  So we'll just have to see when it gets released but I think it's really time to -- to kind of release it, people review it and then move on and let's get on with the -- the great work in front of us.</p><p>COOPER:  So the -- I mean essentially you -- you believe even if the report is released, even if it has negative -- you know some things which are of questionable behavior by the president or attempt to cover up what the Trump Tower meeting was with this sort alternative explanation about it was -- about adoption.</p><p>As long as it's not criminal, at this point, you think it's done no matter what's released, it's really not going to matter and no matter what democrats try in terms of, in your words weaponizing but in terms of investigating, it's not going to matter?</p><p>BANNON:  Yes, I just -- I think it's -- I think -- look, if there's anything substantive -- you know Mueller had what, you know what 20, you know, serious professional prosecutors, they had 42 field agents in the FBI.</p><p>I know as somebody who went through the process, Anderson, it was like a proctology exam.  And -- and I was witness of fact as was Don McGhan and was Reince Priebus.  And -- and so this was a very thorough investigation.</p><p>I think if -- if Mueller had something being the kind of senior level prosecutor he was, he -- he would have done something.  And I think by not doing anything and -- and saying there was no collusion, which this whole thing started about, I -- I think -- I just don't think there's going to be much there.  Look, it's -- it's -- it's what over 1,000 pages long, we'll have to see.</p><p>I said, you know, early on that if the democrats won the House and the Mueller report, you know, had these type of charges in there, had this type of stuff that the -- the democrats would try to, what I call weaponize it and really use it to move forward.</p><p>But I think you're seeing already in the House, people like Nancy Pelosi saying hey, we got to get focused on healthcare, we got to get focused on other things.  So I think that this is a time to move on.  I do think that the media ought to kind of assess both their coverage -- and I've said this for a long time, both their coverage of the 2016 campaign and now their coverage of this whole investigative process.</p><p>I think the media ought to be self regulating and kind of internally look at itself and then I think we just got to move on.  There's so much in front of us with China and what's going on in the world.  It's time to get focused on the big problems facing the country.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and there's a lot -- there's stuff going on with China, which I do want to talk to you about.  In -- in an interview though, I think you gave earlier this week, you said that the president's going to quote -- or going to go full animal, which is an expression I hadn't really heard before but it's really stuck in my mind.</p><p>Now that he sees himself as no longer being under the cloud of the Mueller investigation, what does going full animal look like?  What does that mean for -- because I also know you said that 2019 would be the most vitriolic year in American politics since before the Civil War and you include Vietnam in that.  Both of those things are pretty startling statements.  What is -- what's the vision for this year then?</p><p>BANNON:  Well you know I was talking a Spanish journalist and I think I said honey badger, which as you know is one of my favorite phrases.</p><p>COOPER:  I love honey badger.  Honey badger don't care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Yes.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I think the -- I think the president is going to be very aggressive.  You saw some of the tweets.  In fact I was talking here to the foreign press assoCIAtion in Rome and the president tweeted out the time (inaudible) the opposition party media.</p><p>So I think the president's going to be very aggressive.  I think he feels like the work of the country, particularly the work he had was kind of slowed down, particularly looking internationally because of some the hysteria around this investigation.</p><p>Not the investigation.  I think this is the thing that people should focus on.  He, you know, overly supplied people with documents.  He was very aggressive in getting this information out there because he said from day one there's no collusion.</p><p>But I think about the hysteria is that what he's -- he's you know I think reasonably upset about.  And I think you will definitely see some push back.  You know President Trump's a fighter.  I don't need to tell you Anderson, you know him very well.</p><p>He's a fighter.  And I think he looks at this as a fight and I think he's going to be very aggressive.  I think he's going to start giving interviews and I think he's going to really try to push this.</p><p>And look, we're just in a time and I think democracy has never been stronger in American.  We just had 113 million vote in the midterm elections.  I think -- we are divided but I think division is good and healthy because people have to argue out and have to -- have to kind of fight at the ballot box for what they believe in.</p><p>And I think the country is very engaged in this political process.  I do think this year is going to be very vitriolic and I think we're just going to have to work through this but I think the president of the United States and I think rightfully so that Donald Trump's going to be very aggressive. </p><p>And kind of pushing back on this -- what I think he believes is media hysteria around the investigation at the time entire time that he was actually putting everybody in the White House, everybody on the campaign front and center with all these documents and his lawyers to kind of work through this.</p><p>COOPER:  But -- but you know -- I mean listen, I understand the criticism of the media.  I think every reporter I know is constantly trying to look inward and look at their coverage and if something is wrong apologize for it and correct it as quickly as possible.  But at the same time, the president himself, while he may have been behind the scenes the people of the White House may have been behind the scenes providing all of the documents that they needed, publicly he certainly gave a lot of people a lot of reasons to scratch their heads and think, wait a minute. </p><p>From interviews he gave, to tweets he sent, to things he said to the Russians in the Oval Office. He did provide a lot of the questions -- he certainly stoked it whether he meant to or not. </p><p>BANNON:  Well, Anderson, but Mueller had all of this to go through. So I think he saw it. There is no collusion and if the atmosphere -- I think the president -- justifiably looked at -- and I said this from day one, after the '16 defeat, the Democratic Party was in such disarray, the mainstream media was on the position and during the campaign.  And I'm the one that came up with that term, and it was the opposition party media. </p><p>I think instead of doing mea culpas or big inflections internally, one of the things that the media could do -- and I think this is a big issue for both conservative and liberal media, and this is the FBI's counterintelligence operation, and some of the CIA, what was done at the beginning of the investigation of the Trump campaign? I think it has really got to be looked into. </p><p>I've said now, Anderson, over a year and a half I believe the like church commission is going to have to be established to look at the FBI's behavior in this and the CIA -- and I would hope -- in the old days in the '70s, \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" would lead the investigations, that is not happening. Maybe CNN will do it, but I think there is a lot there, and this is not to get partisan. I think this is for the good of the country.  </p><p>We have to look at -- I'm a huge supporter. I've never been a conspiracy guy, I'm a former naval officer, and my daughter is at West Point.  I'm not a deep state guy.</p><p>But we have some big problems.  I think we have to, in a bipartisan way, look at what these investigations were, particularly look at the start of the Trump -- investigation into the Trump thing, and I think really seriously question some of the FBI counterintelligence, and some of the CIA, and maybe even foreign intelligence services.  </p><p>And I think this is for the good of the country and for the good of the FBI and the CIA too.  But I would hope that that would be the next phase of investigations here.  </p><p>COOPER:  As to the question the vitriolic tone, which you mentioned, the president said recently something which I think a lot of people who don't like the president or distrust the president or are very concerned about, he said before an audience: I could tell you have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump, I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough until they get to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.  </p><p>How do you interpret that?  </p><p>BANNON:  I just think that's -- I think it's President Trump talking about the deplorables, talking about what about his base is, which is, as you know, a lot of veterans, a lot of people that served the country, a lot of people in law enforcement.  I don't think it's anything pejorative.  I don't think there's anything that people get worried about.  </p><p>I think people read more into some of the president's statements sometimes in trying to read the tea leaves.  I think this is all -- although I do think the president is going to be pretty aggressive in his tweets, I think in some of his interviews, I think the way maybe he talks to some people at Congress.  I know he's not particularly happy with -- I think some investigations that may go into his -- the finances of the Trump Organization.  </p><p>I think his point is, hey, the American people had a chance to judge that in 2016.  We voted on it and then had this huge investigation into Russian collusion which turned out to be I think, honestly, kind of a hoax and we've gone through two years of that.  It costs million dollars, but more importantly, it's the opportunity cost.  And now, it's time to really get focused on the kind of move on.  </p><p>So I think very legitimate -- and I could tell you, Donald Trump is a fighter and he's going to fight on this one.  And so, I just think it's time -- and all of these other investigations about his finances and all of this stuff, I think the American people are eventually going to say, hey, look, you're grasping at straws here.  You know, if you don't like the guy and I think Nancy Pelosi said this the other day, go beat him at the ballot box in 2020.  If you think orange man bad, right, and then get organized and get out there and do the kind of effort like you did in 2018 and defeat him in the way that you should -- you know, which we have in the United States.  </p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  If you want to win, win at the ballot box, not in some sort of investigative apparatus to do that.  </p><p>COOPER:  I want to get your thoughts on the field of Democratic candidates and what's going to happen in 2020.  We've got to have a quick break.  If you would, just stick around.  I know it's late in Rome, but appreciate it.  </p><p>We'll be right back.  </p><p>Also, there's breaking news in the uproar of the dismissal of the charges against actor Jussie Smollett.  What the state's attorney is saying now about a so-called error.  </p><p>We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  Back with Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, former CEO of his 2016 campaign.</p><p>So, in terms of the 2020 election, how much of it in your opinion is about convincing people to switch sides or find new voters, and how much is about candidates just getting out their side, mobilization?  </p><p>BANNON:  It's mobilization.  I don't think we're in an age of persuasion.  I mean, you want to persuade people in the margin, but I think it's mobilization.  I think you saw that in '16 where we were able to mobilize the deplorables, particularly in states that the Clinton campaign wasn't focused on.  They didn't think we'd win places like Michigan and Wisconsin and, you know, Pennsylvania.  </p><p>I think '18 election is the same thing.  I think the progressive left did a terrific job like the Tea Party did in the old days of kind of grassroots, door-to-door.  They mobilized their base and they had a big victory.  I think this is all about mobilization.</p><p>And I think this next, you know, four or five months of what I call the gauntlet that the House of Representatives is going to try to think to put up around President Trump and these investigations, I think they look at that as one aspect of how to mobilize their base and how to excite them.  So, I think this is all going to be part of the lead up to 2020.  </p><p>COOPER:  Do you include reaching out and finding people who haven't voted before?  Because that's one of the arguments that some, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman, makes, which was in her district, reaching out to people who finding new voters and bringing them in.  </p><p>BANNON:  I think it's very important.  Low propensity voters, we did that in '16.  One of the things we did in '16 that wasn't quite done in '18 in these House races was low propensity voters.  I think one of the good news for all the Trump supporters is Brad Parscale and the campaign looks like they're very focused on already kind of doing the pick and shovel work that you have to do to build up this kind of -- this field operation and this digital operation to actually get out there and do it.  </p><p>I know the Democrats are going to do it.  Mike Bloomberg is talking about putting $500 million of his own money in to kind of anti-Trump.  </p><p>So I think this is going to be -- look, I think our democracy, Anderson, is in great shape because 113 million people voted.  You know, the political, you know, discussion is permeated even popular culture.  Everybody is talking about it.  </p><p>I think 2020 is going to be just huge.  I think people will be very engaged and I think it's about mobilizing the people that support you.  And I think this is going to very important and I think the winner at the end of the day is going to be who mobilizes his base.  </p><p>COOPER:  I think there are a lot of people who hear you say democracy has never been stronger in America and would take huge issue with that.  That, you know, I mean, look, this is a president who has undermined a number of institutions.  You could argue they deserved to be undermined.  But he certainly, you know -- the -- he's questioned the FBI.  He's questioned, you know, U.S. intelligence which obviously many people have over the years -- </p><p>BANNON:  But I -- but, Anderson, I don't think that's undermining.  I actually think -- I think these institutions -- look, I believe in these institutions, I believe in the FBI, the CIA, some of the institutions in Washington, D.C.  But they have to be rejuvenated.  You always got to question -- remember back in the -- </p><p>COOPER:  Right, but saying the polls are fixed and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  And with Vietnam and all of those issues -- all of the issues, people are going after those all of the time and what happened I think we made these institutions stronger.  And I think that is -- I one of the things, remember, Trump was elected because, you know, working-class Americans believed America was in decline and the elites were comfortable with managed decline and they weren't.  </p><p>Trump is a disruptor.  I mean, he got hired by people who said we want to shake up things and he had this cute phrase of \"drain the swamp\".  </p><p>COOPER:  Right.</p><p>BANNON:  But it's really quite serious.  We want you go to go in and we want you to start focusing on these institutions and making sure they're working for the American people.  So, I don't think -- I think undermine is way too tough of a word.  I think Trump is trying to -- he's a disruptor and he's trying to rejuvenate.  </p><p>COOPER:  I understand the idea of disruption but, you know, he is siding with Vladimir Putin over Dan Coats and, others in the U.S. intelligence service about whether Russia was involved in the election.  He stands next to Putin and says, you know, he says very strongly that he didn't do it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Well, listen, by the way -- but Anderson -- but, Anderson, here is the other thing.  When you see this evidence, I think reasonable people can say -- can question about this whole thing of interference.  I think it is another thing that kind of question -- </p><p>COOPER:  You don't believe the Russians interfered in the election?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Look, no, I think -- I think it was complete marginalia.  It's complete, total marginalia, right?  I think there is another overhyped part of what I call the hoax.  </p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't believe they hacked the e-mails? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  So, it is not a serious thing -- I think like I said on the margin, you might have had some e-mails , you might have had, you know, these guys down in Florida that even Clapper said was what, $115,000 of Facebook ads.  It's all marginalia, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't think stealing the e-mails was a major thing?-- </p><p>BANNON:  The stealing of the Podesta e-mails?  </p><p>COOPER:  Yes.  The Podesta e-mails.  </p><p>BANNON:  Look, should you have done it?  No.  It's wrong to do it, but it's marginalia.  It's inner office gossip, right?  So, I think it was complete marginalia.  </p><p>I'm not saying it's right to do, and we want to make sure we stop the Chinese, we stop the Russians, we stop other people from trying to hack in this, but I think at the end of the day, it's total marginalia.  </p><p>And I don't think President Trump is trying to undermine any American institutions.  I really -- I've got to challenge you on that.  I think what he's trying to do as a disruptor who was hired by working class people in the country to say, hey, you know, we don't want America to be in decline and we particularly don't want this permanent political class that's comfortable with managed decline in the United States.  </p><p>Remember his task is to rejuvenate and I think that's what you're seeing.  </p><p>COOPER:  Yes, I mean, I would say that is a charitable interpretation.  But just one more thing on that, I mean, meeting with Vladimir Putin without anybody else present, meeting with Kim Jong-un without just -- just with interpreters.  I understand disruption, doesn't it concern you have no idea as an American citizen that was discussed?  </p><p>BANNON:  Anderson, Anderson, Anderson, he is commander-in-chief of the United States military, right?  He's the chief law enforcement officer.  He's president of the United States.  </p><p>If he makes a decision that he wants to meet with the world leader with just interpreters or without interpreters, I wouldn't have problems with President Obama, I wouldn't have problems with Clinton or Reagan or anybody.  If the president of the United States in his judgment is going to make that decision, you know, I would abide by it.</p><p>And I think people, if it's President Obama, I think Democrats will say it's fine.  I don't think there is any nefarious activity.  If he wants to make a decision that he wants to talk with an interpreter, I think that is -- look, he was elected commander-in-chief.  You know, one of the big issues we had in the campaign when I stepped in is to give people permission to vote for him as commander-in-chief, particularly given the resume of Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>People did.  They weighed and measured Donald Trump in that campaign and, you know, hard-fought campaign as you remember.  They selected him and I think he got -- I think you got to trust his judgment.</p><p>And if you don't trust his judgment, you've got 2020.  You can get out.  You can knock on doors and you're going to say, hey, he's done all this bad stuff, get your friends out there.  If you oppose him, and beat him at the ballot box.  </p><p>COOPER:  Is there one candidate on the Democratic side announced or expected to announce who you think would provide a real challenge to President Trump?  </p><p>BANNON:  I don't really see a real challenge right now and quite frankly I'm a little surprised, I thought there might be real challenges.  I think the launches of these things have been particularly kind of weak.  </p><p>The one thing I think is different in this primary season, Anderson, than any other we've had in American history is that the -- you know, the sitting president, Donald Trump, is going to have a vote in the Democratic primary.  That's a reality.  And this is because of the -- of President Trump's house style, right?  He's going to be engaged.</p><p>And I think a perfect example is Elizabeth Warren.  </p><p>COOPER:  He's defined her -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Defined as a more well-thought -- well, yes, she's got, probably, if you look at particularly some of the other candidates, she's got some pretty well-defined policy initiatives on big tech, on getting people more -- participation and ownership in society.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Which are things that you have been talking about for a long time.  </p><p>BANNON:  Yes -- </p><p>COOPER:  I mean, the sort of populist message. </p><p>BANNON:  I think on the populist side, you have kind of right wing populism and left wing.  I don't believe all her solution.   I think some of the stuff she's been saying is very smart.  In fact, I kind of say she's lifting from our playbook.  </p><p>But what's most amazing to me is she's now 8 percent and even Trump said, hey, maybe I moved too quickly.  She would have been a weak candidate.  I think it's very interesting and I think it's his direct involvement that has brought Elizabeth Warren under 10 percent and she's having a tough time getting that muzzle velocity, that traction you need to get going.  </p><p>So I think all of the candidates -- one of the things that surprised me the most is how much the -- the AOC kind of, you know, New Green Deal and kind of this movement to the far left economically has pulled the candidates I think farther left and I think they've had some slow starts.  </p><p>Right now, I don't see anybody -- and I think when Joe Biden announces, that's going to peak Biden.  I don't see anybody in this field right now taking on Donald Trump.  You know, Donald Trump is going to be very tough on this campaign.  He's going to go right at you.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  And you see Hillary Clinton coming in? </p><p>BANNON:  You got to go right at him.  </p><p>I -- here is what I think.  Secretary Clinton said she's not running but, you know, she's in the bull pen waiting for the call.  I believe that if you go through this gauntlet this summer, you start the Democratic primary.  By the fall of next year, if there is not a candidate that's kind of breaking out of the pack and looks like they could take on Trump -- because the number one thing for the Democrats is not policy right now.  The number one thing for Democrats is beating Donald Trump.  And they're going to fall in line with whoever they think can beat Donald Trump and shows (ph) can beat him.</p><p>If you get to the fall of 2019 pre-Iowa and you don't have a candidate that's breaking out and looks like it matches up with Trump, you know, I think somebody will call the bull pen and get her to warm up.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  Because she's there, she's going to say, hey, I got 63 million votes --  you know, look, I realize people's heads will blow up, particularly Democrats that don't want anything to do with her.  But remember, at the end of the day, the Democrats I think are going to focus on somebody who could beat Donald Trump and they're going to search for that.  It's not gong to be a policy discussion.  It's going to be electability.</p><p>And if you're going to beat Donald Trump as an incumbent, you're going to have to bring it, right?  You've got to really have to bring it and the field I've seen so far, I don't know anybody that could hit a fastball like Donald Trump can throw.  </p><p>COOPER:  Just lastly, you're in Rome tonight.  You're focus there -- you're there to focus on China.  I've heard you talk about the China 2025 initiative.  It's something I've been looking at.  I find it fascinating.</p><p>It's not getting a lot of attention in the United States, but Chinese espionage, the stealing of trade secrets, recruiting Americans to steal information, it's become a huge issue for intelligence agencies, more than -- I mean, I've talked to some intelligence officers who say it's more -- more than Russia, more than anybody else.  </p><p>Is the U.S. on top of this enough?  </p><p>BANNON:  Well, I think before Trump got there, we weren't.  Remember she came to the Rose Garden a couple of years ago with President Obama and promised President Obama and signed documents saying, hey, we're going to stop the cyber thief, we're going to stop cyber espionage and didn't.</p><p>It was really Trump -- and the reason we did it, that's why we think we won the Upper Midwest is because all these manufacturing jobs that the elites let go to China, that's what's -- you know, the jobs left as J.D. Vance says, the jobs left and the opioid crisis came with the workers that were left behind.  This is a central issue to the United States.  </p><p>And made in China 2025 -- Anderson, let me give you the bad news, it's not about the stealing of intellectual property, it's about forced technology transfers.  This is what this very tough negotiation that Ambassador Lighthizer is having right now on the President Trump's guidance on the trade deal.  </p><p>It's not about soybeans.  It's about making major structural changes to the Chinese economy.  Made in China 2025 is -- every American should understand this because it will change your life -- is the convergence of advanced chip design, artificial intelligence and robotics.  They have a plan which they've been working on for years and announced that by 2025, the conversions of those three will make them an advanced manufacturing superpower and really we'll become kind of a component parts supplier for their manufacturing, high value added.  </p><p>That will crush manufacturing in the United States.  It will lead to underemployment like you can't believe.  This is going to be a massive issue in 2020.  This economic war that China has been running against us, and one of the reasons I'm here in Italy, this One Belt One Road Initiative, the Italians who are allies signed a memorandum of understanding, it's not a full deal, but to anchor the One Belt One Road actually up near Venice on the Adriatic Sea, it's a major strategic shift.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  And I know that the United States is now engaged if talking to Italy, et cetera.  But this geopolitical struggle, this economic war of China versus the West -- and this is why the Russia thing I've said for years is kind of silly.  Russia's economy is the size of New York state.  </p><p>China -- and this is not the Chinese people.  The Chinese people are as decent and hard working honorable people.  This is this kind radical cadre of the Chinese Communist Party that runs China.  It's an economic war, and it's an existential threat economically to the industrial democracies of the West.  </p><p>And this is -- you're going to see this now play on a global stage and it's going to a huge part of the 2020 campaign.  </p><p>COOPER:  Steve Bannon, appreciate talking to you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>BANNON:  Thanks, Anderson.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-584281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-6CC1-DY7X-Y2XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5289\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal News Service, Inc.

He was interviewed by the Mueller team three times. Steve Bannon joins me now from Rome. Mr. Bannon it's a pleasure to have you on.   </p><p>      I want to get to Obamacare a little bit later on but let's start with what the attorney general Barr, according to Chairman Nadler not committing to releasing the full Mueller Report. Do you think he should, except of course of classified material or Grand Jury proceedings?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEVEN BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST</emphasis>:  Look, I think it's obviously up to the attorney general as somebody that was part of the process I think they ought to release it.  </p><p>      But it's the attorney general's decision. You know one of the things, Anderson; I think is lost in all of this is -- is President Trump, you know, waived executive privilege. He waived attorney client privilege. He had not just Reince Priebus and myself but Don McGahn, the White House Counsel and others.  </p><p>      I think it was like 500 witnesses, what 2,800 subpoenas. So the president went out of his way to get all this information out and get it out quickly. So I would assume that everybody would want to get the full report out to people except for what's classified or what needs to be redacted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes, and Lindsey Graham just said today that the president told him directly said, quote, just release it. I know you thought it was legal but not wise for the president to fire Comey.   </p><p>      Given the fact that Mueller has now exonerated the president and those around him when it comes to any kind of collusion or criminal conspiracy with Russia, was smart in retrospect for the president to have been attacking the investigation in the way that he did really for the last two years?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Well, you know, actually -- I actually used you as example when we talked -- when I talked with the president back in the Oval Office. I said hey, on the Comey investigation, I said even Anderson Cooper, you know, has got this in the C Block.   </p><p>      This was in the spring of 17'. But you know the president had his own ideas about the job that Comey was doing. And so he -- he terminated him. I always said that Mueller, I think's an honorable guy.   </p><p>      He's a combat veteran, he's combat marine. And -- but the president, you know whatever he said on Twitter or whatever he said you know in -- in -- in public declarations or on T.V., the important thing was he told everybody to cooperate and to get it out there like no other president's ever done.  </p><p>      That's what was stunning. And in fact I was kind of a critic about how quickly they were releasing information. I thought it ought to be a little bit more processed. You know there's 1.2 million documents that were released.  </p><p>      So I think the president's actions where he was full supportive of the Mueller investigation and that's -- that's why I think it's -- and coming back like it is to kind of exonerate him.  </p><p>      I actually think it's time to release the documents and let's move on and get on with the work of the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  You've been very clear about no collusion all along. You've been probably less definitive; I think is fair to say when it comes to obstruction of justice. Were you surprised that Mueller himself did not reach a conclusion or recommendation on that and essentially hand it over to the attorney general to make a -- a conclusion?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Look -- look, I'm not a lawyer but the way I look at prosecutors either charge or they don't charge. You know the no exoneration line, to me, I thought was a little bit of a cheap shot and -- and I've been very supportive of the Mueller process.  </p><p>      Look he -- here's the thing, they took two years, they looked at everything. It wasn't that I was concerned about an obstruction of justice. I didn't think there was any. But you know you go through all these documents and that's why the 18 election, you know, by the democrats getting out there and working so hard, the grassroots democrats winning the House, I said look, what they're going to try to do is weaponize the Mueller report.  </p><p>      And to -- and to use that as the beginning under Nadler's -- Jerry Nadler's JudiCIAry Committee to start kind of impeachment hearings and impeachment process. I actually think that this -- what happened is with this report; it looks like that's all going to be put to bed. So we'll just have to see when it gets released but I think it's really time to -- to kind of release it, people review it and then move on and let's get on with the -- the great work in front of us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  So the -- I mean essentially you -- you believe even if the report is released, even if it has negative -- you know some things which are of questionable behavior by the president or attempt to cover up what the Trump Tower meeting was with this sort alternative explanation about it was -- about adoption.  </p><p>      As long as it's not criminal, at this point, you think it's done no matter what's released, it's really not going to matter and no matter what democrats try in terms of, in your words weaponizing but in terms of investigating, it's not going to matter?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Yes, I just -- I think it's -- I think -- look, if there's anything substantive -- you know Mueller had what, you know what 20, you know, serious professional prosecutors, they had 42 field agents in the FBI.  </p><p>      I know as somebody who went through the process, Anderson, it was like a proctology exam. And -- and I was witness of fact as was Don McGhan and was Reince Priebus. And -- and so this was a very thorough investigation.  </p><p>      I think if -- if Mueller had something being the kind of senior level prosecutor he was, he -- he would have done something. And I think by not doing anything and -- and saying there was no collusion, which this whole thing started about, I -- I think -- I just don't think there's going to be much there. Look, it's -- it's -- it's what over 1,000 pages long, we'll have to see.  </p><p>      I said, you know, early on that if the democrats won the House and the Mueller report, you know, had these type of charges in there, had this type of stuff that the -- the democrats would try to, what I call weaponize it and really use it to move forward.  </p><p>      But I think you're seeing already in the House, people like Nancy Pelosi saying hey, we got to get focused on healthcare, we got to get focused on other things. So I think that this is a time to move on. I do think that the media ought to kind of assess both their coverage -- and I've said this for a long time, both their coverage of the 2016 campaign and now their coverage of this whole investigative process.  </p><p>      I think the media ought to be self regulating and kind of internally look at itself and then I think we just got to move on. There's so much in front of us with China and what's going on in the world. It's time to get focused on the big problems facing the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes, and there's a lot -- there's stuff going on with China, which I do want to talk to you about. In -- in an interview though, I think you gave earlier this week, you said that the president's going to quote -- or going to go full animal, which is an expression I hadn't really heard before but it's really stuck in my mind.  </p><p>      Now that he sees himself as no longer being under the cloud of the Mueller investigation, what does going full animal look like? What does that mean for -- because I also know you said that 2019 would be the most vitriolic year in American politics since before the Civil War and you include Vietnam in that. Both of those things are pretty startling statements. What is -- what's the vision for this year then?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Well you know I was talking a Spanish journalist and I think I said honey badger, which as you know is one of my favorite phrases.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I love honey badger. Honey badger don't care.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Yes. Exactly. Exactly. I think the -- I think the president is going to be very aggressive. You saw some of the tweets. In fact I was talking here to the foreign press assoCIAtion in Rome and the president tweeted out the time (inaudible) the opposition party media.  </p><p>      So I think the president's going to be very aggressive. I think he feels like the work of the country, particularly the work he had was kind of slowed down, particularly looking internationally because of some the hysteria around this investigation.  </p><p>      Not the investigation. I think this is the thing that people should focus on. He, you know, overly supplied people with documents. He was very aggressive in getting this information out there because he said from day one there's no collusion.  </p><p>      But I think about the hysteria is that what he's -- he's you know I think reasonably upset about. And I think you will definitely see some push back. You know President Trump's a fighter. I don't need to tell you Anderson, you know him very well.  </p><p>      He's a fighter. And I think he looks at this as a fight and I think he's going to be very aggressive. I think he's going to start giving interviews and I think he's going to really try to push this.  </p><p>      And look, we're just in a time and I think democracy has never been stronger in American. We just had 113 million vote in the midterm elections. I think -- we are divided but I think division is good and healthy because people have to argue out and have to -- have to kind of fight at the ballot box for what they believe in.  </p><p>      And I think the country is very engaged in this political process. I do think this year is going to be very vitriolic and I think we're just going to have to work through this but I think the president of the United States and I think rightfully so that Donald Trump's going to be very aggressive.   </p><p>      And kind of pushing back on this -- what I think he believes is media hysteria around the investigation at the time entire time that he was actually putting everybody in the White House, everybody on the campaign front and center with all these documents and his lawyers to kind of work through this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  But -- but you know -- I mean listen, I understand the criticism of the media. I think every reporter I know is constantly trying to look inward and look at their coverage and if something is wrong apologize for it and correct it as quickly as possible. But at the same time, the president himself, while he may have been behind the scenes the people of the White House may have been behind the scenes providing all of the documents that they needed, publicly he certainly gave a lot of people a lot of reasons to scratch their heads and think, wait a minute.   </p><p>      From interviews he gave, to tweets he sent, to things he said to the Russians in the Oval Office. He did provide a lot of the questions -- he certainly stoked it whether he meant to or not.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Well, Anderson, but Mueller had all of this to go through. So I think he saw it. There is no collusion and if the atmosphere -- I think the president -- justifiably looked at -- and I said this from day one, after the '16 defeat, the Democratic Party was in such disarray, the mainstream media was on the position and during the campaign. And I'm the one that came up with that term, and it was the opposition party media.   </p><p>      I think instead of doing mea culpas or big inflections internally, one of the things that the media could do -- and I think this is a big issue for both conservative and liberal media, and this is the FBI's counterintelligence operation, and some of the CIA, what was done at the beginning of the investigation of the Trump campaign? I think it has really got to be looked into.   </p><p>      I've said now, Anderson, over a year and a half I believe the like church commission is going to have to be established to look at the FBI's behavior in this and the CIA -- and I would hope -- in the old days in the '70s, \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" would lead the investigations, that is not happening. Maybe CNN will do it, but I think there is a lot there, and this is not to get partisan. I think this is for the good of the country.   </p><p>      We have to look at -- I'm a huge supporter. I've never been a conspiracy guy, I'm a former naval officer, and my daughter is at West Point. I'm not a deep state guy.  </p><p>      But we have some big problems. I think we have to, in a bipartisan way, look at what these investigations were, particularly look at the start of the Trump -- investigation into the Trump thing, and I think really seriously question some of the FBI counterintelligence, and some of the CIA, and maybe even foreign intelligence services.   </p><p>      And I think this is for the good of the country and for the good of the FBI and the CIA too. But I would hope that that would be the next phase of investigations here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  As to the question the vitriolic tone, which you mentioned, the president said recently something which I think a lot of people who don't like the president or distrust the president or are very concerned about, he said before an audience:  I could tell you have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump, I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough until they get to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.   </p><p>      How do you interpret that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  I just think that's -- I think it's President Trump talking about the deplorables, talking about what about his base is, which is, as you know, a lot of veterans, a lot of people that served the country, a lot of people in law enforcement. I don't think it's anything pejorative. I don't think there's anything that people get worried about.   </p><p>      I think people read more into some of the president's statements sometimes in trying to read the tea leaves. I think this is all -- although I do think the president is going to be pretty aggressive in his tweets, I think in some of his interviews, I think the way maybe he talks to some people at Congress. I know he's not particularly happy with -- I think some investigations that may go into his -- the finances of the Trump Organization.   </p><p>      I think his point is, hey, the American people had a chance to judge that in 2016. We voted on it and then had this huge investigation into Russian collusion which turned out to be I think, honestly, kind of a hoax and we've gone through two years of that. It costs million dollars, but more importantly, it's the opportunity cost. And now, it's time to really get focused on the kind of move on.   </p><p>      So I think very legitimate -- and I could tell you, Donald Trump is a fighter and he's going to fight on this one. And so, I just think it's time -- and all of these other investigations about his finances and all of this stuff, I think the American people are eventually going to say, hey, look, you're grasping at straws here. You know, if you don't like the guy and I think Nancy Pelosi said this the other day, go beat him at the ballot box in 2020. If you think orange man bad, right, and then get organized and get out there and do the kind of effort like you did in 2018 and defeat him in the way that you should -- you know, which we have in the United States.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  If you want to win, win at the ballot box, not in some sort of investigative apparatus to do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I want to get your thoughts on the field of Democratic candidates and what's going to happen in 2020. We've got to have a quick break. If you would, just stick around. I know it's late in Rome, but appreciate it.   </p><p>      We'll be right back.   </p><p>      Also, there's breaking news in the uproar of the dismissal of the charges against actor Jussie Smollett. What the state's attorney is saying now about a so-called error.   </p><p>      We'll be right back.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Back with Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, former CEO of his 2016 campaign.  </p><p>      So, in terms of the 2020 election, how much of it in your opinion is about convincing people to switch sides or find new voters, and how much is about candidates just getting out their side, mobilization?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  It's mobilization. I don't think we're in an age of persuasion. I mean, you want to persuade people in the margin, but I think it's mobilization. I think you saw that in '16 where we were able to mobilize the deplorables, particularly in states that the Clinton campaign wasn't focused on. They didn't think we'd win places like Michigan and Wisconsin and, you know, Pennsylvania.   </p><p>      I think '18 election is the same thing. I think the progressive left did a terrific job like the Tea Party did in the old days of kind of grassroots, door-to-door. They mobilized their base and they had a big victory. I think this is all about mobilization.  </p><p>      And I think this next, you know, four or five months of what I call the gauntlet that the House of Representatives is going to try to think to put up around President Trump and these investigations, I think they look at that as one aspect of how to mobilize their base and how to excite them. So, I think this is all going to be part of the lead up to 2020.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Do you include reaching out and finding people who haven't voted before? Because that's one of the arguments that some, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman, makes, which was in her district, reaching out to people who finding new voters and bringing them in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  I think it's very important. Low propensity voters, we did that in '16. One of the things we did in '16 that wasn't quite done in '18 in these House races was low propensity voters. I think one of the good news for all the Trump supporters is Brad Parscale and the campaign looks like they're very focused on already kind of doing the pick and shovel work that you have to do to build up this kind of -- this field operation and this digital operation to actually get out there and do it.   </p><p>      I know the Democrats are going to do it. Mike Bloomberg is talking about putting $500 million of his own money in to kind of anti-Trump.   </p><p>      So I think this is going to be -- look, I think our democracy, Anderson, is in great shape because 113 million people voted. You know, the political, you know, discussion is permeated even popular culture. Everybody is talking about it.   </p><p>      I think 2020 is going to be just huge. I think people will be very engaged and I think it's about mobilizing the people that support you. And I think this is going to very important and I think the winner at the end of the day is going to be who mobilizes his base.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I think there are a lot of people who hear you say democracy has never been stronger in America and would take huge issue with that. That, you know, I mean, look, this is a president who has undermined a number of institutions. You could argue they deserved to be undermined. But he certainly, you know -- the -- he's questioned the FBI. He's questioned, you know, U.S. intelligence which obviously many people have over the years --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  But I -- but, Anderson, I don't think that's undermining. I actually think -- I think these institutions -- look, I believe in these institutions, I believe in the FBI, the CIA, some of the institutions in Washington, D.C. But they have to be rejuvenated. You always got to question -- remember back in the --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Right, but saying the polls are fixed and --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  And with Vietnam and all of those issues -- all of the issues, people are going after those all of the time and what happened I think we made these institutions stronger. And I think that is -- I one of the things, remember, Trump was elected because, you know, working-class Americans believed America was in decline and the elites were comfortable with managed decline and they weren't.   </p><p>Trump is a disruptor. I mean, he got hired by people who said we want to shake up things and he had this cute phrase of \"drain the swamp\".   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  But it's really quite serious. We want you go to go in and we want you to start focusing on these institutions and making sure they're working for the American people. So, I don't think -- I think undermine is way too tough of a word. I think Trump is trying to -- he's a disruptor and he's trying to rejuvenate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I understand the idea of disruption but, you know, he is siding with Vladimir Putin over Dan Coats and, others in the U.S. intelligence service about whether Russia was involved in the election. He stands next to Putin and says, you know, he says very strongly that he didn't do it.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Well, listen, by the way -- but Anderson -- but, Anderson, here is the other thing. When you see this evidence, I think reasonable people can say -- can question about this whole thing of interference. I think it is another thing that kind of question --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  You don't believe the Russians interfered in the election?   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Look, no, I think -- I think it was complete marginalia. It's complete, total marginalia, right? I think there is another overhyped part of what I call the hoax.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  So, you don't believe they hacked the e-mails?   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  So, it is not a serious thing -- I think like I said on the margin, you might have had some e-mails , you might have had, you know, these guys down in Florida that even Clapper said was what, $115,000 of Facebook ads. It's all marginalia, right?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  So, you don't think stealing the e-mails was a major thing?--   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  The stealing of the Podesta e-mails?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes. The Podesta e-mails.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Look, should you have done it? No. It's wrong to do it, but it's marginalia. It's inner office gossip, right? So, I think it was complete marginalia.   </p><p>      I'm not saying it's right to do, and we want to make sure we stop the Chinese, we stop the Russians, we stop other people from trying to hack in this, but I think at the end of the day, it's total marginalia.   </p><p>      And I don't think President Trump is trying to undermine any American institutions. I really -- I've got to challenge you on that. I think what he's trying to do as a disruptor who was hired by working class people in the country to say, hey, you know, we don't want America to be in decline and we particularly don't want this permanent political class that's comfortable with managed decline in the United States.   </p><p>      Remember his task is to rejuvenate and I think that's what you're seeing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean, I would say that is a charitable interpretation. But just one more thing on that, I mean, meeting with Vladimir Putin without anybody else present, meeting with Kim Jong-un without just -- just with interpreters. I understand disruption, doesn't it concern you have no idea as an American citizen that was discussed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Anderson, Anderson, Anderson, he is commander-in-chief of the United States military, right? He's the chief law enforcement officer. He's president of the United States.   </p><p>      If he makes a decision that he wants to meet with the world leader with just interpreters or without interpreters, I wouldn't have problems with President Obama, I wouldn't have problems with Clinton or Reagan or anybody. If the president of the United States in his judgment is going to make that decision, you know, I would abide by it.  </p><p>      And I think people, if it's President Obama, I think Democrats will say it's fine. I don't think there is any nefarious activity. If he wants to make a decision that he wants to talk with an interpreter, I think that is -- look, he was elected commander-in-chief. You know, one of the big issues we had in the campaign when I stepped in is to give people permission to vote for him as commander-in-chief, particularly given the resume of Hillary Clinton.   </p><p>      People did. They weighed and measured Donald Trump in that campaign and, you know, hard-fought campaign as you remember. They selected him and I think he got -- I think you got to trust his judgment.  </p><p>      And if you don't trust his judgment, you've got 2020. You can get out. You can knock on doors and you're going to say, hey, he's done all this bad stuff, get your friends out there. If you oppose him, and beat him at the ballot box.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Is there one candidate on the Democratic side announced or expected to announce who you think would provide a real challenge to President Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  I don't really see a real challenge right now and quite frankly I'm a little surprised, I thought there might be real challenges. I think the launches of these things have been particularly kind of weak.   </p><p>      The one thing I think is different in this primary season, Anderson, than any other we've had in American history is that the -- you know, the sitting president, Donald Trump, is going to have a vote in the Democratic primary. That's a reality. And this is because of the -- of President Trump's house style, right? He's going to be engaged.  </p><p>      And I think a perfect example is Elizabeth Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  He's defined her --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Defined as a more well-thought -- well, yes, she's got, probably, if you look at particularly some of the other candidates, she's got some pretty well-defined policy initiatives on big tech, on getting people more -- participation and ownership in society.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Which are things that you have been talking about for a long time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Yes --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I mean, the sort of populist message.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  I think on the populist side, you have kind of right wing populism and left wing. I don't believe all her solution. I think some of the stuff she's been saying is very smart. In fact, I kind of say she's lifting from our playbook.   </p><p>      But what's most amazing to me is she's now 8 percent and even Trump said, hey, maybe I moved too quickly. She would have been a weak candidate. I think it's very interesting and I think it's his direct involvement that has brought Elizabeth Warren under 10 percent and she's having a tough time getting that muzzle velocity, that traction you need to get going.   </p><p>      So I think all of the candidates -- one of the things that surprised me the most is how much the -- the AOC kind of, you know, New Green Deal and kind of this movement to the far left economically has pulled the candidates I think farther left and I think they've had some slow starts.   </p><p>      Right now, I don't see anybody -- and I think when Joe Biden announces, that's going to peak Biden. I don't see anybody in this field right now taking on Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trump is going to be very tough on this campaign. He's going to go right at you.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  And you see Hillary Clinton coming in?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  You got to go right at him.   </p><p>      I -- here is what I think. Secretary Clinton said she's not running but, you know, she's in the bull pen waiting for the call. I believe that if you go through this gauntlet this summer, you start the Democratic primary. By the fall of next year, if there is not a candidate that's kind of breaking out of the pack and looks like they could take on Trump -- because the number one thing for the Democrats is not policy right now. The number one thing for Democrats is beating Donald Trump. And they're going to fall in line with whoever they think can beat Donald Trump and shows (ph) can beat him.  </p><p>      If you get to the fall of 2019 pre-Iowa and you don't have a candidate that's breaking out and looks like it matches up with Trump, you know, I think somebody will call the bull pen and get her to warm up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Because she's there, she's going to say, hey, I got 63 million votes -- you know, look, I realize people's heads will blow up, particularly Democrats that don't want anything to do with her. But remember, at the end of the day, the Democrats I think are going to focus on somebody who could beat Donald Trump and they're going to search for that. It's not gong to be a policy discussion. It's going to be electability.  </p><p>      And if you're going to beat Donald Trump as an incumbent, you're going to have to bring it, right? You've got to really have to bring it and the field I've seen so far, I don't know anybody that could hit a fastball like Donald Trump can throw.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Just lastly, you're in Rome tonight. You're focus there -- you're there to focus on China. I've heard you talk about the China 2025 initiative. It's something I've been looking at. I find it fascinating.  </p><p>      It's not getting a lot of attention in the United States, but Chinese espionage, the stealing of trade secrets, recruiting Americans to steal information, it's become a huge issue for intelligence agencies, more than -- I mean, I've talked to some intelligence officers who say it's more -- more than Russia, more than anybody else.   </p><p>      Is the U.S. on top of this enough?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Well, I think before Trump got there, we weren't. Remember she came to the Rose Garden a couple of years ago with President Obama and promised President Obama and signed documents saying, hey, we're going to stop the cyber thief, we're going to stop cyber espionage and didn't.  </p><p>      It was really Trump -- and the reason we did it, that's why we think we won the Upper Midwest is because all these manufacturing jobs that the elites let go to China, that's what's -- you know, the jobs left as J.D. Vance says, the jobs left and the opioid crisis came with the workers that were left behind. This is a central issue to the United States.   </p><p>      And made in China 2025 -- Anderson, let me give you the bad news, it's not about the stealing of intellectual property, it's about forced technology transfers. This is what this very tough negotiation that Ambassador Lighthizer is having right now on the President Trump's guidance on the trade deal.   </p><p>      It's not about soybeans. It's about making major structural changes to the Chinese economy. Made in China 2025 is -- every American should understand this because it will change your life -- is the convergence of advanced chip design, artificial intelligence and robotics. They have a plan which they've been working on for years and announced that by 2025, the conversions of those three will make them an advanced manufacturing superpower and really we'll become kind of a component parts supplier for their manufacturing, high value added.   </p><p>      That will crush manufacturing in the United States. It will lead to underemployment like you can't believe. This is going to be a massive issue in 2020. This economic war that China has been running against us, and one of the reasons I'm here in Italy, this One Belt One Road Initiative, the Italians who are allies signed a memorandum of understanding, it's not a full deal, but to anchor the One Belt One Road actually up near Venice on the Adriatic Sea, it's a major strategic shift.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  And I know that the United States is now engaged if talking to Italy, et cetera. But this geopolitical struggle, this economic war of China versus the West -- and this is why the Russia thing I've said for years is kind of silly. Russia's economy is the size of New York state.   </p><p>      China -- and this is not the Chinese people. The Chinese people are as decent and hard working honorable people. This is this kind radical cadre of the Chinese Communist Party that runs China. It's an economic war, and it's an existential threat economically to the industrial democracies of the West.   </p><p>      And this is -- you're going to see this now play on a global stage and it's going to a huge part of the 2020 campaign.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Steve Bannon, appreciate talking to you. Thanks very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BANNON</emphasis>:  Thanks, Anderson.   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-GFJ1-JDPT-T47G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

He wasinterviewed by the Mueller team three times. Steve Bannon joins menow from Rome. Mr. Bannon it's a pleasure to have you on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to get to Obamacare a little bit later on but let'sstart with what the attorney general Barr, according to ChairmanNadler not committing to releasing the full Mueller Report. Do youthink he should, except of course of classified material or GrandJury proceedings?</p><p>STEVEN BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Look, Ithink it's obviously up to the attorney general as somebody thatwas part of the process I think they ought to release it.</p><p>But it's the attorney general's decision. You know one ofthe things, Anderson; I think is lost in all of this is -- isPresident Trump, you know, waived executive privilege. He waivedattorney client privilege. He had not just Reince Priebus and myselfbut Don McGahn, the White House Counsel and others.</p><p>I think it was like 500 witnesses, what 2,800 subpoenas. So thepresident went out of his way to get all this information out andget it out quickly. So I would assume that everybody would want toget the full report out to people except for what's classified orwhat needs to be redacted.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and Lindsey Graham just said today that thepresident told him directly said, quote, just release it. I know youthought it was legal but not wise for the president to fire Comey.</p><p>Given the fact that Mueller has now exonerated the presidentand those around him when it comes to any kind of collusion orcriminal conspiracy with Russia, was smart in retrospect for thepresident to have been attacking the investigation in the way thathe did really for the last two years?</p><p>BANNON:  Well, you know, actually -- I actually used you asexample when we talked -- when I talked with the president back inthe Oval Office. I said hey, on the Comey investigation, I said evenAnderson Cooper, you know, has got this in the C Block.</p><p>This was in the spring of 17'. But you know the president hadhis own ideas about the job that Comey was doing. And so he -- heterminated him. I always said that Mueller, I think's an honorableguy.</p><p>He's a combat veteran, he's combat marine. And -- but thepresident, you know whatever he said on Twitter or whatever he saidyou know in -- in -- in public declarations or on T.V., theimportant thing was he told everybody to cooperate and to get it outthere like no other president's ever done.</p><p>That's what was stunning. And in fact I was kind of a criticabout how quickly they were releasing information. I thought itought to be a little bit more processed. You know there's 1.2million documents that were released.</p><p>So I think the president's actions where he was fullsupportive of the Mueller investigation and that's -- that's whyI think it's -- and coming back like it is to kind of exoneratehim.</p><p>I actually think it's time to release the documents andlet's move on and get on with the work of the country.</p><p>COOPER:  You've been very clear about no collusion all along.You've been probably less definitive; I think is fair to say whenit comes to obstruction of justice. Were you surprised that Muellerhimself did not reach a conclusion or recommendation on that andessentially hand it over to the attorney general to make a -- aconclusion?</p><p>BANNON:  Look -- look, I'm not a lawyer but the way I look atprosecutors either charge or they don't charge. You know the noexoneration line, to me, I thought was a little bit of a cheap shotand -- and I've been very supportive of the Mueller process.</p><p>Look he -- here's the thing, they took two years, they lookedat everything. It wasn't that I was concerned about an obstructionof justice. I didn't think there was any. But you know you gothrough all these documents and that's why the 18 election, youknow, by the democrats getting out there and working so hard, thegrassroots democrats winning the House, I said look, what they'regoing to try to do is weaponize the Mueller report.</p><p>And to -- and to use that as the beginning under Nadler's --Jerry Nadler's JudiCIAry Committee to start kind of impeachmenthearings and impeachment process. I actually think that this -- whathappened is with this report; it looks like that's all going to beput to bed. So we'll just have to see when it gets released but Ithink it's really time to -- to kind of release it, people reviewit and then move on and let's get on with the -- the great work infront of us.</p><p>COOPER:  So the -- I mean essentially you -- you believe even ifthe report is released, even if it has negative -- you know somethings which are of questionable behavior by the president orattempt to cover up what the Trump Tower meeting was with this sortalternative explanation about it was -- about adoption.</p><p>As long as it's not criminal, at this point, you think it'sdone no matter what's released, it's really not going to matterand no matter what democrats try in terms of, in your wordsweaponizing but in terms of investigating, it's not going tomatter?</p><p>BANNON:  Yes, I just -- I think it's -- I think -- look, ifthere's anything substantive -- you know Mueller had what, youknow what 20, you know, serious professional prosecutors, they had42 field agents in the FBI.</p><p>I know as somebody who went through the process, Anderson, itwas like a proctology exam. And -- and I was witness of fact as wasDon McGhan and was Reince Priebus. And -- and so this was a verythorough investigation.</p><p>I think if -- if Mueller had something being the kind of seniorlevel prosecutor he was, he -- he would have done something. And Ithink by not doing anything and -- and saying there was nocollusion, which this whole thing started about, I -- I think -- Ijust don't think there's going to be much there. Look, it's --it's -- it's what over 1,000 pages long, we'll have to see.</p><p>I said, you know, early on that if the democrats won the Houseand the Mueller report, you know, had these type of charges inthere, had this type of stuff that the -- the democrats would tryto, what I call weaponize it and really use it to move forward.</p><p>But I think you're seeing already in the House, people likeNancy Pelosi saying hey, we got to get focused on healthcare, we gotto get focused on other things. So I think that this is a time tomove on. I do think that the media ought to kind of assess boththeir coverage -- and I've said this for a long time, both theircoverage of the 2016 campaign and now their coverage of this wholeinvestigative process.</p><p>I think the media ought to be self regulating and kind ofinternally look at itself and then I think we just got to move on.There's so much in front of us with China and what's going on inthe world. It's time to get focused on the big problems facing thecountry.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and there's a lot -- there's stuff going onwith China, which I do want to talk to you about. In -- in aninterview though, I think you gave earlier this week, you said thatthe president's going to quote -- or going to go full animal,which is an expression I hadn't really heard before but it'sreally stuck in my mind.</p><p>Now that he sees himself as no longer being under the cloud ofthe Mueller investigation, what does going full animal look like?What does that mean for -- because I also know you said that 2019would be the most vitriolic year in American politics since beforethe Civil War and you include Vietnam in that. Both of those thingsare pretty startling statements. What is -- what's the vision forthis year then?</p><p>BANNON:  Well you know I was talking a Spanish journalist and Ithink I said honey badger, which as you know is one of my favoritephrases.</p><p>COOPER:  I love honey badger. Honey badger don't care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Yes. Exactly. Exactly. I think the -- I think thepresident is going to be very aggressive. You saw some of thetweets. In fact I was talking here to the foreign press assoCIAtionin Rome and the president tweeted out the time (inaudible) theopposition party media.</p><p>So I think the president's going to be very aggressive. Ithink he feels like the work of the country, particularly the workhe had was kind of slowed down, particularly looking internationallybecause of some the hysteria around this investigation.</p><p>Not the investigation. I think this is the thing that peopleshould focus on. He, you know, overly supplied people withdocuments. He was very aggressive in getting this information outthere because he said from day one there's no collusion.</p><p>But I think about the hysteria is that what he's -- he'syou know I think reasonably upset about. And I think you willdefinitely see some push back. You know President Trump's afighter. I don't need to tell you Anderson, you know him verywell.</p><p>He's a fighter. And I think he looks at this as a fight and Ithink he's going to be very aggressive. I think he's going tostart giving interviews and I think he's going to really try topush this.</p><p>And look, we're just in a time and I think democracy hasnever been stronger in American. We just had 113 million vote in themidterm elections. I think -- we are divided but I think division isgood and healthy because people have to argue out and have to --have to kind of fight at the ballot box for what they believe in.</p><p>And I think the country is very engaged in this politicalprocess. I do think this year is going to be very vitriolic and Ithink we're just going to have to work through this but I thinkthe president of the United States and I think rightfully so thatDonald Trump's going to be very aggressive.</p><p>And kind of pushing back on this -- what I think he believes ismedia hysteria around the investigation at the time entire time thathe was actually putting everybody in the White House, everybody onthe campaign front and center with all these documents and hislawyers to kind of work through this.</p><p>COOPER:  But -- but you know -- I mean listen, I understand thecriticism of the media. I think every reporter I know is constantlytrying to look inward and look at their coverage and if something iswrong apologize for it and correct it as quickly as possible. But atthe same time, the president himself, while he may have been behindthe scenes the people of the White House may have been behind thescenes providing all of the documents that they needed, publicly hecertainly gave a lot of people a lot of reasons to scratch theirheads and think, wait a minute.</p><p>From interviews he gave, to tweets he sent, to things he saidto the Russians in the Oval Office. He did provide a lot of thequestions -- he certainly stoked it whether he meant to or not.</p><p>BANNON:  Well, Anderson, but Mueller had all of this to gothrough. So I think he saw it. There is no collusion and if theatmosphere -- I think the president -- justifiably looked at -- andI said this from day one, after the '16 defeat, the Democratic Partywas in such disarray, the mainstream media was on the position andduring the campaign. And I'm the one that came up with that term,and it was the opposition party media.</p><p>I think instead of doing mea culpas or big inflectionsinternally, one of the things that the media could do -- and I thinkthis is a big issue for both conservative and liberal media, andthis is the FBI's counterintelligence operation, and some of theCIA, what was done at the beginning of the investigation of theTrump campaign? I think it has really got to be looked into.</p><p>I've said now, Anderson, over a year and a half I believe thelike church commission is going to have to be established to look atthe FBI's behavior in this and the CIA -- and I would hope -- inthe old days in the '70s, \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\"would lead the investigations, that is not happening. Maybe CNN willdo it, but I think there is a lot there, and this is not to getpartisan. I think this is for the good of the country.</p><p>We have to look at -- I'm a huge supporter. I've never beena conspiracy guy, I'm a former naval officer, and my daughter isat West Point. I'm not a deep state guy.</p><p>But we have some big problems. I think we have to, in abipartisan way, look at what these investigations were, particularlylook at the start of the Trump -- investigation into the Trumpthing, and I think really seriously question some of the FBIcounterintelligence, and some of the CIA, and maybe even foreignintelligence services.</p><p>And I think this is for the good of the country and for thegood of the FBI and the CIA too. But I would hope that that would bethe next phase of investigations here.</p><p>COOPER:  As to the question the vitriolic tone, which youmentioned, the president said recently something which I think a lotof people who don't like the president or distrust the president orare very concerned about, he said before an audience:  I could tellyou have the support of the police, the support of the military, thesupport of the Bikers for Trump, I have the tough people, but theydon't play it tough until they get to a certain point, and then itwould be very bad, very bad.</p><p>How do you interpret that?</p><p>BANNON:  I just think that's -- I think it's President Trumptalking about the deplorables, talking about what about his base is,which is, as you know, a lot of veterans, a lot of people thatserved the country, a lot of people in law enforcement. I don'tthink it's anything pejorative. I don't think there's anythingthat people get worried about.</p><p>I think people read more into some of the president'sstatements sometimes in trying to read the tea leaves. I think thisis all -- although I do think the president is going to be prettyaggressive in his tweets, I think in some of his interviews, I thinkthe way maybe he talks to some people at Congress. I know he's notparticularly happy with -- I think some investigations that may gointo his -- the finances of the Trump Organization.</p><p>I think his point is, hey, the American people had a chance tojudge that in 2016. We voted on it and then had this hugeinvestigation into Russian collusion which turned out to be I think,honestly, kind of a hoax and we've gone through two years of that.It costs million dollars, but more importantly, it's theopportunity cost. And now, it's time to really get focused on thekind of move on.</p><p>So I think very legitimate -- and I could tell you, DonaldTrump is a fighter and he's going to fight on this one. And so, Ijust think it's time -- and all of these other investigationsabout his finances and all of this stuff, I think the Americanpeople are eventually going to say, hey, look, you're grasping atstraws here. You know, if you don't like the guy and I think NancyPelosi said this the other day, go beat him at the ballot box in2020. If you think orange man bad, right, and then get organized andget out there and do the kind of effort like you did in 2018 anddefeat him in the way that you should -- you know, which we have inthe United States.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  If you want to win, win at the ballot box, not in somesort of investigative apparatus to do that.</p><p>COOPER:  I want to get your thoughts on the field of Democraticcandidates and what's going to happen in 2020. We've got to havea quick break. If you would, just stick around. I know it's latein Rome, but appreciate it.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Also, there's breaking news in the uproar of the dismissal ofthe charges against actor Jussie Smollett. What the state's attorneyis saying now about a so-called error.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  Back with Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of theTrump White House, former CEO of his 2016 campaign.</p><p>So, in terms of the 2020 election, how much of it in youropinion is about convincing people to switch sides or find newvoters, and how much is about candidates just getting out theirside, mobilization?</p><p>BANNON:  It's mobilization. I don't think we're in an age ofpersuasion. I mean, you want to persuade people in the margin, but Ithink it's mobilization. I think you saw that in '16 where we wereable to mobilize the deplorables, particularly in states that theClinton campaign wasn't focused on. They didn't think we'd winplaces like Michigan and Wisconsin and, you know, Pennsylvania.</p><p>I think '18 election is the same thing. I think the progressiveleft did a terrific job like the Tea Party did in the old days ofkind of grassroots, door-to-door. They mobilized their base and theyhad a big victory. I think this is all about mobilization.</p><p>And I think this next, you know, four or five months of what Icall the gauntlet that the House of Representatives is going to tryto think to put up around President Trump and these investigations,I think they look at that as one aspect of how to mobilize theirbase and how to excite them. So, I think this is all going to bepart of the lead up to 2020.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you include reaching out and finding people whohaven't voted before? Because that's one of the arguments thatsome, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman, makes,which was in her district, reaching out to people who finding newvoters and bringing them in.</p><p>BANNON:  I think it's very important. Low propensity voters,we did that in '16. One of the things we did in '16 that wasn'tquite done in '18 in these House races was low propensity voters. Ithink one of the good news for all the Trump supporters is BradParscale and the campaign looks like they're very focused onalready kind of doing the pick and shovel work that you have to doto build up this kind of -- this field operation and this digitaloperation to actually get out there and do it.</p><p>I know the Democrats are going to do it. Mike Bloomberg istalking about putting $500 million of his own money in to kind ofanti-Trump.</p><p>So I think this is going to be -- look, I think our democracy,Anderson, is in great shape because 113 million people voted. Youknow, the political, you know, discussion is permeated even popularculture. Everybody is talking about it.</p><p>I think 2020 is going to be just huge. I think people will bevery engaged and I think it's about mobilizing the people thatsupport you. And I think this is going to very important and I thinkthe winner at the end of the day is going to be who mobilizes hisbase.</p><p>COOPER:  I think there are a lot of people who hear you saydemocracy has never been stronger in America and would take hugeissue with that. That, you know, I mean, look, this is a presidentwho has undermined a number of institutions. You could argue theydeserved to be undermined. But he certainly, you know -- the -- he'squestioned the FBI. He's questioned, you know, U.S. intelligencewhich obviously many people have over the years --</p><p>BANNON:  But I -- but, Anderson, I don't think that'sundermining. I actually think -- I think these institutions -- look,I believe in these institutions, I believe in the FBI, the CIA, someof the institutions in Washington, D.C. But they have to berejuvenated. You always got to question -- remember back in the --</p><p>COOPER:  Right, but saying the polls are fixed and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  And with Vietnam and all of those issues -- all of theissues, people are going after those all of the time and whathappened I think we made these institutions stronger. And I thinkthat is -- I one of the things, remember, Trump was elected because,you know, working-class Americans believed America was in declineand the elites were comfortable with managed decline and theyweren't.</p><p>Trump is a disruptor. I mean, he got hired by people who saidwe want to shake up things and he had this cute phrase of \"drain theswamp\".</p><p>COOPER:  Right.</p><p>BANNON:  But it's really quite serious. We want you go to goin and we want you to start focusing on these institutions andmaking sure they're working for the American people. So, I don'tthink -- I think undermine is way too tough of a word. I think Trumpis trying to -- he's a disruptor and he's trying to rejuvenate.</p><p>COOPER:  I understand the idea of disruption but, you know, heis siding with Vladimir Putin over Dan Coats and, others in the U.S.intelligence service about whether Russia was involved in theelection. He stands next to Putin and says, you know, he says verystrongly that he didn't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Well, listen, by the way -- but Anderson -- but,Anderson, here is the other thing. When you see this evidence, Ithink reasonable people can say -- can question about this wholething of interference. I think it is another thing that kind ofquestion --</p><p>COOPER:  You don't believe the Russians interfered in theelection?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Look, no, I think -- I think it was completemarginalia. It's complete, total marginalia, right? I think thereis another overhyped part of what I call the hoax.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't believe they hacked the e-mails?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  So, it is not a serious thing -- I think like I said onthe margin, you might have had some e-mails , you might have had,you know, these guys down in Florida that even Clapper said waswhat, $115,000 of Facebook ads. It's all marginalia, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't think stealing the e-mails was a majorthing?--</p><p>BANNON:  The stealing of the Podesta e-mails?</p><p>COOPER:  Yes. The Podesta e-mails.</p><p>BANNON:  Look, should you have done it? No. It's wrong to doit, but it's marginalia. It's inner office gossip, right? So, Ithink it was complete marginalia.</p><p>I'm not saying it's right to do, and we want to make surewe stop the Chinese, we stop the Russians, we stop other people fromtrying to hack in this, but I think at the end of the day, it'stotal marginalia.</p><p>And I don't think President Trump is trying to undermine anyAmerican institutions. I really -- I've got to challenge you onthat. I think what he's trying to do as a disruptor who was hired byworking class people in the country to say, hey, you know, we don'twant America to be in decline and we particularly don't want thispermanent political class that's comfortable with managed declinein the United States.</p><p>Remember his task is to rejuvenate and I think that's whatyou're seeing.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, I mean, I would say that is a charitableinterpretation. But just one more thing on that, I mean, meetingwith Vladimir Putin without anybody else present, meeting with KimJong-un without just -- just with interpreters. I understanddisruption, doesn't it concern you have no idea as an Americancitizen that was discussed?</p><p>BANNON:  Anderson, Anderson, Anderson, he is commander-in-chiefof the United States military, right? He's the chief law enforcementofficer. He's president of the United States.</p><p>If he makes a decision that he wants to meet with the worldleader with just interpreters or without interpreters, I wouldn'thave problems with President Obama, I wouldn't have problems withClinton or Reagan or anybody. If the president of the United Statesin his judgment is going to make that decision, you know, I wouldabide by it.</p><p>And I think people, if it's President Obama, I thinkDemocrats will say it's fine. I don't think there is any nefariousactivity. If he wants to make a decision that he wants to talk withan interpreter, I think that is -- look, he was electedcommander-in-chief. You know, one of the big issues we had in thecampaign when I stepped in is to give people permission to vote forhim as commander-in-chief, particularly given the resume of HillaryClinton.</p><p>People did. They weighed and measured Donald Trump in thatcampaign and, you know, hard-fought campaign as you remember. Theyselected him and I think he got -- I think you got to trust hisjudgment.</p><p>And if you don't trust his judgment, you've got 2020. You canget out. You can knock on doors and you're going to say, hey, he'sdone all this bad stuff, get your friends out there. If you opposehim, and beat him at the ballot box.</p><p>COOPER:  Is there one candidate on the Democratic side announcedor expected to announce who you think would provide a real challengeto President Trump?</p><p>BANNON:  I don't really see a real challenge right now and quitefrankly I'm a little surprised, I thought there might be realchallenges. I think the launches of these things have beenparticularly kind of weak.</p><p>The one thing I think is different in this primary season,Anderson, than any other we've had in American history is that the-- you know, the sitting president, Donald Trump, is going to have avote in the Democratic primary. That's a reality. And this isbecause of the -- of President Trump's house style, right? He'sgoing to be engaged.</p><p>And I think a perfect example is Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>COOPER:  He's defined her --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Defined as a more well-thought -- well, yes, she'sgot, probably, if you look at particularly some of the othercandidates, she's got some pretty well-defined policy initiativeson big tech, on getting people more -- participation and ownershipin society.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Which are things that you have been talking about for along time.</p><p>BANNON:  Yes --</p><p>COOPER:  I mean, the sort of populist message.</p><p>BANNON:  I think on the populist side, you have kind of rightwing populism and left wing. I don't believe all her solution. Ithink some of the stuff she's been saying is very smart. In fact,I kind of say she's lifting from our playbook.</p><p>But what's most amazing to me is she's now 8 percent and evenTrump said, hey, maybe I moved too quickly. She would have been aweak candidate. I think it's very interesting and I think it'shis direct involvement that has brought Elizabeth Warren under 10percent and she's having a tough time getting that muzzle velocity,that traction you need to get going.</p><p>So I think all of the candidates -- one of the things thatsurprised me the most is how much the -- the AOC kind of, you know,New Green Deal and kind of this movement to the far lefteconomically has pulled the candidates I think farther left and Ithink they've had some slow starts.</p><p>Right now, I don't see anybody -- and I think when Joe Bidenannounces, that's going to peak Biden. I don't see anybody inthis field right now taking on Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trumpis going to be very tough on this campaign. He's going to go rightat you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  And you see Hillary Clinton coming in?</p><p>BANNON:  You got to go right at him.</p><p>I -- here is what I think. Secretary Clinton said she's notrunning but, you know, she's in the bull pen waiting for the call. Ibelieve that if you go through this gauntlet this summer, you startthe Democratic primary. By the fall of next year, if there is not acandidate that's kind of breaking out of the pack and looks likethey could take on Trump -- because the number one thing for theDemocrats is not policy right now. The number one thing forDemocrats is beating Donald Trump. And they're going to fall in linewith whoever they think can beat Donald Trump and shows (ph) canbeat him.</p><p>If you get to the fall of 2019 pre-Iowa and you don't have acandidate that's breaking out and looks like it matches up withTrump, you know, I think somebody will call the bull pen and get herto warm up.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  Because she's there, she's going to say, hey, I got63 million votes -- you know, look, I realize people's heads willblow up, particularly Democrats that don't want anything to do withher. But remember, at the end of the day, the Democrats I think aregoing to focus on somebody who could beat Donald Trump and they'regoing to search for that. It's not gong to be a policy discussion.It's going to be electability.</p><p>And if you're going to beat Donald Trump as an incumbent,you're going to have to bring it, right? You've got to really haveto bring it and the field I've seen so far, I don't know anybodythat could hit a fastball like Donald Trump can throw.</p><p>COOPER:  Just lastly, you're in Rome tonight. You're focusthere -- you're there to focus on China. I've heard you talkabout the China 2025 initiative. It's something I've beenlooking at. I find it fascinating.</p><p>It's not getting a lot of attention in the United States, butChinese espionage, the stealing of trade secrets, recruitingAmericans to steal information, it's become a huge issue forintelligence agencies, more than -- I mean, I've talked to someintelligence officers who say it's more -- more than Russia, morethan anybody else.</p><p>Is the U.S. on top of this enough?</p><p>BANNON:  Well, I think before Trump got there, we weren't.Remember she came to the Rose Garden a couple of years ago withPresident Obama and promised President Obama and signed documentssaying, hey, we're going to stop the cyber thief, we're going tostop cyber espionage and didn't.</p><p>It was really Trump -- and the reason we did it, that's whywe think we won the Upper Midwest is because all these manufacturingjobs that the elites let go to China, that's what's -- you know,the jobs left as J.D. Vance says, the jobs left and the opioidcrisis came with the workers that were left behind. This is acentral issue to the United States.</p><p>And made in China 2025 -- Anderson, let me give you the badnews, it's not about the stealing of intellectual property, it'sabout forced technology transfers. This is what this very toughnegotiation that Ambassador Lighthizer is having right now on thePresident Trump's guidance on the trade deal.</p><p>It's not about soybeans. It's about making major structuralchanges to the Chinese economy. Made in China 2025 is -- everyAmerican should understand this because it will change your life --is the convergence of advanced chip design, artificial intelligenceand robotics. They have a plan which they've been working on foryears and announced that by 2025, the conversions of those threewill make them an advanced manufacturing superpower and really we'llbecome kind of a component parts supplier for their manufacturing,high value added.</p><p>That will crush manufacturing in the United States. It willlead to underemployment like you can't believe. This is going to bea massive issue in 2020. This economic war that China has beenrunning against us, and one of the reasons I'm here in Italy, thisOne Belt One Road Initiative, the Italians who are allies signed amemorandum of understanding, it's not a full deal, but to anchorthe One Belt One Road actually up near Venice on the Adriatic Sea,it's a major strategic shift.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  And I know that the United States is now engaged iftalking to Italy, et cetera. But this geopolitical struggle, thiseconomic war of China versus the West -- and this is why the Russiathing I've said for years is kind of silly. Russia's economy isthe size of New York state.</p><p>China -- and this is not the Chinese people. The Chinese peopleare as decent and hard working honorable people. This is this kindradical cadre of the Chinese Communist Party that runs China. It'san economic war, and it's an existential threat economically tothe industrial democracies of the West.</p><p>And this is -- you're going to see this now play on a globalstage and it's going to a huge part of the 2020 campaign.</p><p>COOPER:  Steve Bannon, appreciate talking to you.

He wasinterviewed by the Mueller team three times. Steve Bannon joins menow from Rome. Mr. Bannon it's a pleasure to have you on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to get to Obamacare a little bit later on but let'sstart with what the attorney general Barr, according to ChairmanNadler not committing to releasing the full Mueller Report. Do youthink he should, except of course of classified material or GrandJury proceedings?</p><p>STEVEN BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Look, Ithink it's obviously up to the attorney general as somebody thatwas part of the process I think they ought to release it.</p><p>But it's the attorney general's decision. You know one ofthe things, Anderson; I think is lost in all of this is -- isPresident Trump, you know, waived executive privilege. He waivedattorney client privilege. He had not just Reince Priebus and myselfbut Don McGahn, the White House Counsel and others.</p><p>I think it was like 500 witnesses, what 2,800 subpoenas. So thepresident went out of his way to get all this information out andget it out quickly. So I would assume that everybody would want toget the full report out to people except for what's classified orwhat needs to be redacted.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and Lindsey Graham just said today that thepresident told him directly said, quote, just release it. I know youthought it was legal but not wise for the president to fire Comey.</p><p>Given the fact that Mueller has now exonerated the presidentand those around him when it comes to any kind of collusion orcriminal conspiracy with Russia, was smart in retrospect for thepresident to have been attacking the investigation in the way thathe did really for the last two years?</p><p>BANNON:  Well, you know, actually -- I actually used you asexample when we talked -- when I talked with the president back inthe Oval Office. I said hey, on the Comey investigation, I said evenAnderson Cooper, you know, has got this in the C Block.</p><p>This was in the spring of 17'. But you know the president hadhis own ideas about the job that Comey was doing. And so he -- heterminated him. I always said that Mueller, I think's an honorableguy.</p><p>He's a combat veteran, he's combat marine. And -- but thepresident, you know whatever he said on Twitter or whatever he saidyou know in -- in -- in public declarations or on T.V., theimportant thing was he told everybody to cooperate and to get it outthere like no other president's ever done.</p><p>That's what was stunning. And in fact I was kind of a criticabout how quickly they were releasing information. I thought itought to be a little bit more processed. You know there's 1.2million documents that were released.</p><p>So I think the president's actions where he was fullsupportive of the Mueller investigation and that's -- that's whyI think it's -- and coming back like it is to kind of exoneratehim.</p><p>I actually think it's time to release the documents andlet's move on and get on with the work of the country.</p><p>COOPER:  You've been very clear about no collusion all along.You've been probably less definitive; I think is fair to say whenit comes to obstruction of justice. Were you surprised that Muellerhimself did not reach a conclusion or recommendation on that andessentially hand it over to the attorney general to make a -- aconclusion?</p><p>BANNON:  Look -- look, I'm not a lawyer but the way I look atprosecutors either charge or they don't charge. You know the noexoneration line, to me, I thought was a little bit of a cheap shotand -- and I've been very supportive of the Mueller process.</p><p>Look he -- here's the thing, they took two years, they lookedat everything. It wasn't that I was concerned about an obstructionof justice. I didn't think there was any. But you know you gothrough all these documents and that's why the 18 election, youknow, by the democrats getting out there and working so hard, thegrassroots democrats winning the House, I said look, what they'regoing to try to do is weaponize the Mueller report.</p><p>And to -- and to use that as the beginning under Nadler's --Jerry Nadler's JudiCIAry Committee to start kind of impeachmenthearings and impeachment process. I actually think that this -- whathappened is with this report; it looks like that's all going to beput to bed. So we'll just have to see when it gets released but Ithink it's really time to -- to kind of release it, people reviewit and then move on and let's get on with the -- the great work infront of us.</p><p>COOPER:  So the -- I mean essentially you -- you believe even ifthe report is released, even if it has negative -- you know somethings which are of questionable behavior by the president orattempt to cover up what the Trump Tower meeting was with this sortalternative explanation about it was -- about adoption.</p><p>As long as it's not criminal, at this point, you think it'sdone no matter what's released, it's really not going to matterand no matter what democrats try in terms of, in your wordsweaponizing but in terms of investigating, it's not going tomatter?</p><p>BANNON:  Yes, I just -- I think it's -- I think -- look, ifthere's anything substantive -- you know Mueller had what, youknow what 20, you know, serious professional prosecutors, they had42 field agents in the FBI.</p><p>I know as somebody who went through the process, Anderson, itwas like a proctology exam. And -- and I was witness of fact as wasDon McGhan and was Reince Priebus. And -- and so this was a verythorough investigation.</p><p>I think if -- if Mueller had something being the kind of seniorlevel prosecutor he was, he -- he would have done something. And Ithink by not doing anything and -- and saying there was nocollusion, which this whole thing started about, I -- I think -- Ijust don't think there's going to be much there. Look, it's --it's -- it's what over 1,000 pages long, we'll have to see.</p><p>I said, you know, early on that if the democrats won the Houseand the Mueller report, you know, had these type of charges inthere, had this type of stuff that the -- the democrats would tryto, what I call weaponize it and really use it to move forward.</p><p>But I think you're seeing already in the House, people likeNancy Pelosi saying hey, we got to get focused on healthcare, we gotto get focused on other things. So I think that this is a time tomove on. I do think that the media ought to kind of assess boththeir coverage -- and I've said this for a long time, both theircoverage of the 2016 campaign and now their coverage of this wholeinvestigative process.</p><p>I think the media ought to be self regulating and kind ofinternally look at itself and then I think we just got to move on.There's so much in front of us with China and what's going on inthe world. It's time to get focused on the big problems facing thecountry.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, and there's a lot -- there's stuff going onwith China, which I do want to talk to you about. In -- in aninterview though, I think you gave earlier this week, you said thatthe president's going to quote -- or going to go full animal,which is an expression I hadn't really heard before but it'sreally stuck in my mind.</p><p>Now that he sees himself as no longer being under the cloud ofthe Mueller investigation, what does going full animal look like?What does that mean for -- because I also know you said that 2019would be the most vitriolic year in American politics since beforethe Civil War and you include Vietnam in that. Both of those thingsare pretty startling statements. What is -- what's the vision forthis year then?</p><p>BANNON:  Well you know I was talking a Spanish journalist and Ithink I said honey badger, which as you know is one of my favoritephrases.</p><p>COOPER:  I love honey badger. Honey badger don't care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Yes. Exactly. Exactly. I think the -- I think thepresident is going to be very aggressive. You saw some of thetweets. In fact I was talking here to the foreign press assoCIAtionin Rome and the president tweeted out the time (inaudible) theopposition party media.</p><p>So I think the president's going to be very aggressive. Ithink he feels like the work of the country, particularly the workhe had was kind of slowed down, particularly looking internationallybecause of some the hysteria around this investigation.</p><p>Not the investigation. I think this is the thing that peopleshould focus on. He, you know, overly supplied people withdocuments. He was very aggressive in getting this information outthere because he said from day one there's no collusion.</p><p>But I think about the hysteria is that what he's -- he'syou know I think reasonably upset about. And I think you willdefinitely see some push back. You know President Trump's afighter. I don't need to tell you Anderson, you know him verywell.</p><p>He's a fighter. And I think he looks at this as a fight and Ithink he's going to be very aggressive. I think he's going tostart giving interviews and I think he's going to really try topush this.</p><p>And look, we're just in a time and I think democracy hasnever been stronger in American. We just had 113 million vote in themidterm elections. I think -- we are divided but I think division isgood and healthy because people have to argue out and have to --have to kind of fight at the ballot box for what they believe in.</p><p>And I think the country is very engaged in this politicalprocess. I do think this year is going to be very vitriolic and Ithink we're just going to have to work through this but I thinkthe president of the United States and I think rightfully so thatDonald Trump's going to be very aggressive.</p><p>And kind of pushing back on this -- what I think he believes ismedia hysteria around the investigation at the time entire time thathe was actually putting everybody in the White House, everybody onthe campaign front and center with all these documents and hislawyers to kind of work through this.</p><p>COOPER:  But -- but you know -- I mean listen, I understand thecriticism of the media. I think every reporter I know is constantlytrying to look inward and look at their coverage and if something iswrong apologize for it and correct it as quickly as possible. But atthe same time, the president himself, while he may have been behindthe scenes the people of the White House may have been behind thescenes providing all of the documents that they needed, publicly hecertainly gave a lot of people a lot of reasons to scratch theirheads and think, wait a minute.</p><p>From interviews he gave, to tweets he sent, to things he saidto the Russians in the Oval Office. He did provide a lot of thequestions -- he certainly stoked it whether he meant to or not.</p><p>BANNON:  Well, Anderson, but Mueller had all of this to gothrough. So I think he saw it. There is no collusion and if theatmosphere -- I think the president -- justifiably looked at -- andI said this from day one, after the '16 defeat, the Democratic Partywas in such disarray, the mainstream media was on the position andduring the campaign. And I'm the one that came up with that term,and it was the opposition party media.</p><p>I think instead of doing mea culpas or big inflectionsinternally, one of the things that the media could do -- and I thinkthis is a big issue for both conservative and liberal media, andthis is the FBI's counterintelligence operation, and some of theCIA, what was done at the beginning of the investigation of theTrump campaign? I think it has really got to be looked into.</p><p>I've said now, Anderson, over a year and a half I believe thelike church commission is going to have to be established to look atthe FBI's behavior in this and the CIA -- and I would hope -- inthe old days in the '70s, \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\"would lead the investigations, that is not happening. Maybe CNN willdo it, but I think there is a lot there, and this is not to getpartisan. I think this is for the good of the country.</p><p>We have to look at -- I'm a huge supporter. I've never beena conspiracy guy, I'm a former naval officer, and my daughter isat West Point. I'm not a deep state guy.</p><p>But we have some big problems. I think we have to, in abipartisan way, look at what these investigations were, particularlylook at the start of the Trump -- investigation into the Trumpthing, and I think really seriously question some of the FBIcounterintelligence, and some of the CIA, and maybe even foreignintelligence services.</p><p>And I think this is for the good of the country and for thegood of the FBI and the CIA too. But I would hope that that would bethe next phase of investigations here.</p><p>COOPER:  As to the question the vitriolic tone, which youmentioned, the president said recently something which I think a lotof people who don't like the president or distrust the president orare very concerned about, he said before an audience:  I could tellyou have the support of the police, the support of the military, thesupport of the Bikers for Trump, I have the tough people, but theydon't play it tough until they get to a certain point, and then itwould be very bad, very bad.</p><p>How do you interpret that?</p><p>BANNON:  I just think that's -- I think it's President Trumptalking about the deplorables, talking about what about his base is,which is, as you know, a lot of veterans, a lot of people thatserved the country, a lot of people in law enforcement. I don'tthink it's anything pejorative. I don't think there's anythingthat people get worried about.</p><p>I think people read more into some of the president'sstatements sometimes in trying to read the tea leaves. I think thisis all -- although I do think the president is going to be prettyaggressive in his tweets, I think in some of his interviews, I thinkthe way maybe he talks to some people at Congress. I know he's notparticularly happy with -- I think some investigations that may gointo his -- the finances of the Trump Organization.</p><p>I think his point is, hey, the American people had a chance tojudge that in 2016. We voted on it and then had this hugeinvestigation into Russian collusion which turned out to be I think,honestly, kind of a hoax and we've gone through two years of that.It costs million dollars, but more importantly, it's theopportunity cost. And now, it's time to really get focused on thekind of move on.</p><p>So I think very legitimate -- and I could tell you, DonaldTrump is a fighter and he's going to fight on this one. And so, Ijust think it's time -- and all of these other investigationsabout his finances and all of this stuff, I think the Americanpeople are eventually going to say, hey, look, you're grasping atstraws here. You know, if you don't like the guy and I think NancyPelosi said this the other day, go beat him at the ballot box in2020. If you think orange man bad, right, and then get organized andget out there and do the kind of effort like you did in 2018 anddefeat him in the way that you should -- you know, which we have inthe United States.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  If you want to win, win at the ballot box, not in somesort of investigative apparatus to do that.</p><p>COOPER:  I want to get your thoughts on the field of Democraticcandidates and what's going to happen in 2020. We've got to havea quick break. If you would, just stick around. I know it's latein Rome, but appreciate it.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Also, there's breaking news in the uproar of the dismissal ofthe charges against actor Jussie Smollett. What the state's attorneyis saying now about a so-called error.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  Back with Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of theTrump White House, former CEO of his 2016 campaign.</p><p>So, in terms of the 2020 election, how much of it in youropinion is about convincing people to switch sides or find newvoters, and how much is about candidates just getting out theirside, mobilization?</p><p>BANNON:  It's mobilization. I don't think we're in an age ofpersuasion. I mean, you want to persuade people in the margin, but Ithink it's mobilization. I think you saw that in '16 where we wereable to mobilize the deplorables, particularly in states that theClinton campaign wasn't focused on. They didn't think we'd winplaces like Michigan and Wisconsin and, you know, Pennsylvania.</p><p>I think '18 election is the same thing. I think the progressiveleft did a terrific job like the Tea Party did in the old days ofkind of grassroots, door-to-door. They mobilized their base and theyhad a big victory. I think this is all about mobilization.</p><p>And I think this next, you know, four or five months of what Icall the gauntlet that the House of Representatives is going to tryto think to put up around President Trump and these investigations,I think they look at that as one aspect of how to mobilize theirbase and how to excite them. So, I think this is all going to bepart of the lead up to 2020.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you include reaching out and finding people whohaven't voted before? Because that's one of the arguments thatsome, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman, makes,which was in her district, reaching out to people who finding newvoters and bringing them in.</p><p>BANNON:  I think it's very important. Low propensity voters,we did that in '16. One of the things we did in '16 that wasn'tquite done in '18 in these House races was low propensity voters. Ithink one of the good news for all the Trump supporters is BradParscale and the campaign looks like they're very focused onalready kind of doing the pick and shovel work that you have to doto build up this kind of -- this field operation and this digitaloperation to actually get out there and do it.</p><p>I know the Democrats are going to do it. Mike Bloomberg istalking about putting $500 million of his own money in to kind ofanti-Trump.</p><p>So I think this is going to be -- look, I think our democracy,Anderson, is in great shape because 113 million people voted. Youknow, the political, you know, discussion is permeated even popularculture. Everybody is talking about it.</p><p>I think 2020 is going to be just huge. I think people will bevery engaged and I think it's about mobilizing the people thatsupport you. And I think this is going to very important and I thinkthe winner at the end of the day is going to be who mobilizes hisbase.</p><p>COOPER:  I think there are a lot of people who hear you saydemocracy has never been stronger in America and would take hugeissue with that. That, you know, I mean, look, this is a presidentwho has undermined a number of institutions. You could argue theydeserved to be undermined. But he certainly, you know -- the -- he'squestioned the FBI. He's questioned, you know, U.S. intelligencewhich obviously many people have over the years --</p><p>BANNON:  But I -- but, Anderson, I don't think that'sundermining. I actually think -- I think these institutions -- look,I believe in these institutions, I believe in the FBI, the CIA, someof the institutions in Washington, D.C. But they have to berejuvenated. You always got to question -- remember back in the --</p><p>COOPER:  Right, but saying the polls are fixed and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  And with Vietnam and all of those issues -- all of theissues, people are going after those all of the time and whathappened I think we made these institutions stronger. And I thinkthat is -- I one of the things, remember, Trump was elected because,you know, working-class Americans believed America was in declineand the elites were comfortable with managed decline and theyweren't.</p><p>Trump is a disruptor. I mean, he got hired by people who saidwe want to shake up things and he had this cute phrase of \"drain theswamp\".</p><p>COOPER:  Right.</p><p>BANNON:  But it's really quite serious. We want you go to goin and we want you to start focusing on these institutions andmaking sure they're working for the American people. So, I don'tthink -- I think undermine is way too tough of a word. I think Trumpis trying to -- he's a disruptor and he's trying to rejuvenate.</p><p>COOPER:  I understand the idea of disruption but, you know, heis siding with Vladimir Putin over Dan Coats and, others in the U.S.intelligence service about whether Russia was involved in theelection. He stands next to Putin and says, you know, he says verystrongly that he didn't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Well, listen, by the way -- but Anderson -- but,Anderson, here is the other thing. When you see this evidence, Ithink reasonable people can say -- can question about this wholething of interference. I think it is another thing that kind ofquestion --</p><p>COOPER:  You don't believe the Russians interfered in theelection?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Look, no, I think -- I think it was completemarginalia. It's complete, total marginalia, right? I think thereis another overhyped part of what I call the hoax.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't believe they hacked the e-mails?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  So, it is not a serious thing -- I think like I said onthe margin, you might have had some e-mails , you might have had,you know, these guys down in Florida that even Clapper said waswhat, $115,000 of Facebook ads. It's all marginalia, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  So, you don't think stealing the e-mails was a majorthing?--</p><p>BANNON:  The stealing of the Podesta e-mails?</p><p>COOPER:  Yes. The Podesta e-mails.</p><p>BANNON:  Look, should you have done it? No. It's wrong to doit, but it's marginalia. It's inner office gossip, right? So, Ithink it was complete marginalia.</p><p>I'm not saying it's right to do, and we want to make surewe stop the Chinese, we stop the Russians, we stop other people fromtrying to hack in this, but I think at the end of the day, it'stotal marginalia.</p><p>And I don't think President Trump is trying to undermine anyAmerican institutions. I really -- I've got to challenge you onthat. I think what he's trying to do as a disruptor who was hired byworking class people in the country to say, hey, you know, we don'twant America to be in decline and we particularly don't want thispermanent political class that's comfortable with managed declinein the United States.</p><p>Remember his task is to rejuvenate and I think that's whatyou're seeing.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes, I mean, I would say that is a charitableinterpretation. But just one more thing on that, I mean, meetingwith Vladimir Putin without anybody else present, meeting with KimJong-un without just -- just with interpreters. I understanddisruption, doesn't it concern you have no idea as an Americancitizen that was discussed?</p><p>BANNON:  Anderson, Anderson, Anderson, he is commander-in-chiefof the United States military, right? He's the chief law enforcementofficer. He's president of the United States.</p><p>If he makes a decision that he wants to meet with the worldleader with just interpreters or without interpreters, I wouldn'thave problems with President Obama, I wouldn't have problems withClinton or Reagan or anybody. If the president of the United Statesin his judgment is going to make that decision, you know, I wouldabide by it.</p><p>And I think people, if it's President Obama, I thinkDemocrats will say it's fine. I don't think there is any nefariousactivity. If he wants to make a decision that he wants to talk withan interpreter, I think that is -- look, he was electedcommander-in-chief. You know, one of the big issues we had in thecampaign when I stepped in is to give people permission to vote forhim as commander-in-chief, particularly given the resume of HillaryClinton.</p><p>People did. They weighed and measured Donald Trump in thatcampaign and, you know, hard-fought campaign as you remember. Theyselected him and I think he got -- I think you got to trust hisjudgment.</p><p>And if you don't trust his judgment, you've got 2020. You canget out. You can knock on doors and you're going to say, hey, he'sdone all this bad stuff, get your friends out there. If you opposehim, and beat him at the ballot box.</p><p>COOPER:  Is there one candidate on the Democratic side announcedor expected to announce who you think would provide a real challengeto President Trump?</p><p>BANNON:  I don't really see a real challenge right now and quitefrankly I'm a little surprised, I thought there might be realchallenges. I think the launches of these things have beenparticularly kind of weak.</p><p>The one thing I think is different in this primary season,Anderson, than any other we've had in American history is that the-- you know, the sitting president, Donald Trump, is going to have avote in the Democratic primary. That's a reality. And this isbecause of the -- of President Trump's house style, right? He'sgoing to be engaged.</p><p>And I think a perfect example is Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>COOPER:  He's defined her --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON:  Defined as a more well-thought -- well, yes, she'sgot, probably, if you look at particularly some of the othercandidates, she's got some pretty well-defined policy initiativeson big tech, on getting people more -- participation and ownershipin society.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Which are things that you have been talking about for along time.</p><p>BANNON:  Yes --</p><p>COOPER:  I mean, the sort of populist message.</p><p>BANNON:  I think on the populist side, you have kind of rightwing populism and left wing. I don't believe all her solution. Ithink some of the stuff she's been saying is very smart. In fact,I kind of say she's lifting from our playbook.</p><p>But what's most amazing to me is she's now 8 percent and evenTrump said, hey, maybe I moved too quickly. She would have been aweak candidate. I think it's very interesting and I think it'shis direct involvement that has brought Elizabeth Warren under 10percent and she's having a tough time getting that muzzle velocity,that traction you need to get going.</p><p>So I think all of the candidates -- one of the things thatsurprised me the most is how much the -- the AOC kind of, you know,New Green Deal and kind of this movement to the far lefteconomically has pulled the candidates I think farther left and Ithink they've had some slow starts.</p><p>Right now, I don't see anybody -- and I think when Joe Bidenannounces, that's going to peak Biden. I don't see anybody inthis field right now taking on Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trumpis going to be very tough on this campaign. He's going to go rightat you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  And you see Hillary Clinton coming in?</p><p>BANNON:  You got to go right at him.</p><p>I -- here is what I think. Secretary Clinton said she's notrunning but, you know, she's in the bull pen waiting for the call. Ibelieve that if you go through this gauntlet this summer, you startthe Democratic primary. By the fall of next year, if there is not acandidate that's kind of breaking out of the pack and looks likethey could take on Trump -- because the number one thing for theDemocrats is not policy right now. The number one thing forDemocrats is beating Donald Trump. And they're going to fall in linewith whoever they think can beat Donald Trump and shows (ph) canbeat him.</p><p>If you get to the fall of 2019 pre-Iowa and you don't have acandidate that's breaking out and looks like it matches up withTrump, you know, I think somebody will call the bull pen and get herto warm up.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  Because she's there, she's going to say, hey, I got63 million votes -- you know, look, I realize people's heads willblow up, particularly Democrats that don't want anything to do withher. But remember, at the end of the day, the Democrats I think aregoing to focus on somebody who could beat Donald Trump and they'regoing to search for that. It's not gong to be a policy discussion.It's going to be electability.</p><p>And if you're going to beat Donald Trump as an incumbent,you're going to have to bring it, right? You've got to really haveto bring it and the field I've seen so far, I don't know anybodythat could hit a fastball like Donald Trump can throw.</p><p>COOPER:  Just lastly, you're in Rome tonight. You're focusthere -- you're there to focus on China. I've heard you talkabout the China 2025 initiative. It's something I've beenlooking at. I find it fascinating.</p><p>It's not getting a lot of attention in the United States, butChinese espionage, the stealing of trade secrets, recruitingAmericans to steal information, it's become a huge issue forintelligence agencies, more than -- I mean, I've talked to someintelligence officers who say it's more -- more than Russia, morethan anybody else.</p><p>Is the U.S. on top of this enough?</p><p>BANNON:  Well, I think before Trump got there, we weren't.Remember she came to the Rose Garden a couple of years ago withPresident Obama and promised President Obama and signed documentssaying, hey, we're going to stop the cyber thief, we're going tostop cyber espionage and didn't.</p><p>It was really Trump -- and the reason we did it, that's whywe think we won the Upper Midwest is because all these manufacturingjobs that the elites let go to China, that's what's -- you know,the jobs left as J.D. Vance says, the jobs left and the opioidcrisis came with the workers that were left behind. This is acentral issue to the United States.</p><p>And made in China 2025 -- Anderson, let me give you the badnews, it's not about the stealing of intellectual property, it'sabout forced technology transfers. This is what this very toughnegotiation that Ambassador Lighthizer is having right now on thePresident Trump's guidance on the trade deal.</p><p>It's not about soybeans. It's about making major structuralchanges to the Chinese economy. Made in China 2025 is -- everyAmerican should understand this because it will change your life --is the convergence of advanced chip design, artificial intelligenceand robotics. They have a plan which they've been working on foryears and announced that by 2025, the conversions of those threewill make them an advanced manufacturing superpower and really we'llbecome kind of a component parts supplier for their manufacturing,high value added.</p><p>That will crush manufacturing in the United States. It willlead to underemployment like you can't believe. This is going to bea massive issue in 2020. This economic war that China has beenrunning against us, and one of the reasons I'm here in Italy, thisOne Belt One Road Initiative, the Italians who are allies signed amemorandum of understanding, it's not a full deal, but to anchorthe One Belt One Road actually up near Venice on the Adriatic Sea,it's a major strategic shift.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes.</p><p>BANNON:  And I know that the United States is now engaged iftalking to Italy, et cetera. But this geopolitical struggle, thiseconomic war of China versus the West -- and this is why the Russiathing I've said for years is kind of silly. Russia's economy isthe size of New York state.</p><p>China -- and this is not the Chinese people. The Chinese peopleare as decent and hard working honorable people. This is this kindradical cadre of the Chinese Communist Party that runs China. It'san economic war, and it's an existential threat economically tothe industrial democracies of the West.</p><p>And this is -- you're going to see this now play on a globalstage and it's going to a huge part of the 2020 campaign.</p><p>COOPER:  Steve Bannon, appreciate talking to you. Thanks verymuch.</p><p>BANNON:  Thanks, Anderson.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2198233898</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WR3-84B1-DY0W-44W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5175\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Mar 28, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>CNN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Italy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Priebus, Reince</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bannon, Stephen K</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coats, Dan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Manufacturing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Attorneys general</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obstruction of justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal investigations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mueller report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 515210</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000128</classCode><className>ATTORNEYS GENERAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

CNN's Reliable Sources asked several top Trump figures about it for their Wednesday newsletter, and one person who responded was Trump insider/outsider Stephen Bannon, who felt the President is right to want to take action against 'big tech.' </p><p>CNN's Oliver Darcy, who spoke to Bannon, tweeted some his comments[1]. Bannon, of course, runs Breitbart.com, best known for their primary verticals 'Big Hollywood' and 'Big Government'. He told Darcy he wants big government to step in with new regulations to seize private information from independent business by force, and then create new big government bureaucracy to manage that data for the 'public good.' Bannon said Big Tech's data should be seized and put in a 'public trust.' Specifically, Bannon said, 'I think you take [the data] away from the companies. All that data they have is put in a public trust. They can use it. And people can opt in and opt out. That trust is run by an independent board of directors. It just can't be that [Big Tech is] the sole proprietors of this dataI think this is a public good.' Bannon added that Big Tech companies 'have to be broken up' just like Teddy Roosevelt broke up the trusts.' There is no 'Public Good' or 'Big Tech' vertical at Breitbart.com at the time of this posting. Darcy also reports that Bannon attacked Facebook, Twitter and Google executives, calling them 'sociopaths' and 'complete narcissists' who 'ought to be controlled.' 'These people are evil,' he said of the capitalist search and social media business executives. 'There is no doubt about that.' Click here for the original email report[2]. Darcy also reported on CNN this morning[3] that Google claims they can disprove the claims made in the video the President tweeted about Google's 'State of the Union' bias.

This is Oliver Darcy again at the helm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump continues war with Big Tech</p><p>President Trump's war with Google spilled into a second day on Wednesday. The president raised eyebrows when he posted a video to Twitter that suggested Google had promoted President Obama's State of the Union addresses, but not his. \"#StopTheBias,\" Trump tweeted. The problem? Google said in a statement shortly after that it had in fact promoted Trump's 2018 address... BuzzFeed has a full debunk here...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Full statement from a Google spokesperson: \"On January 30 2018, we highlighted the livestream of President Trump's State of the Union on the google.com homepage. We have historically not promoted the first address to Congress by a new president, which is technically not a State of the Union address. As a result, we didn't include a promotion on google.com for this address in either 2009 or 2017.\"</p><p>White House mum</p><p>After receiving Google's statement, I reached out to Sarah Sanders. I asked her if the White House will address the matter or issue a correction. I also asked why the president was sharing misleading info aimed at damaging a private business on Twitter. I didn't receive a response...</p><p>Steve Bannon, however, has some thoughts...</p><p>One person who did want to chat was Steve Bannon. I had texted Bannon earlier in the day to see what he made of Trump's war on Big Tech. Bannon, after all, has been talking about this tech stuff for some time now. Earlier tonight he gave me a ring. Some highlights of what he said...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Asked about Trump pushing misleading info to advance a war on Big Tech, Bannon said, \"The president often times sees information and thinks it ought to be in the public dialogue.\" Bannon said the \"direction\" of Trump's rhetoric is \"correct\" and that his tweets on issues often help get things \"into the conversation.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon said Big Tech's data should be seized and put in a \"public trust.\" Specifically, Bannon said, \"I think you take [the data] away from the companies. All that data they have is put in a public trust. They can use it. And people can opt in and opt out. That trust is run by an independent board of directors. It just can't be that [Big Tech is] the sole proprietors of this data...I think this is a public good.\" Bannon added that Big Tech companies \"have to be broken up\" just like Teddy Roosevelt broke up the trusts.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon attacked the executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \"These are run by sociopaths,\" he said. \"These people are complete narcissists. These people ought to be controlled, they ought to be regulated.\" At one point during the phone call, Bannon said, \"These people are evil. There is no doubt about that.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon said he thinks \"this is going to be a massive issue\" in future elections. He said he thinks it will probably take until 2020 to fully blossom as a campaign issue, explaining, \"I think by the time 2020 comes along, this will be a burning issue. I think this will be one of the biggest domestic issues.\" Bannon said the \"#MeToo movement has brought the issue of consent front and center\" and argued that \"this is going to bring the issue of digital consent front and center.\"</p><p>Swisher's take</p><p>Kara Swisher, on the other hand, does not appear to be a fan of Trump's Big Tech rhetoric. She wrote a blistering piece in the NYT on Wednesday, skewering Trump for what she said was a \"ludicrous attack\" on Big Tech. In her piece's opening line, Swisher wrote, \"Here's the truest conundrum of the social media age: Those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another section of interest: \"Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note. Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.\"</p><p>Author of bogus Google study: Regulation of Big Tech not the answer</p><p>The blogger who wrote the bogus study that asserted 96% of results returned by Google for the \"Trump news\" search query wrote an op-ed in WaPo on Wednesday. In the op-ed, Paula Bolyard said she stood by her study, but shot down the idea of regulating Big Tech.</p><p>Read more of Wednesday's Reliable Sources newsletter... And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bolyard: \"Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem.\"</p><p>This all sets the table for next week's hearing...</p><p>Donie O'Sullivan emails: Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey, and an empty chair. Next week's Senate Intel Committee hearing on what social media companies are doing to protect the integrity of the midterm elections could turn into quite the spectacle. The committee asked for someone from Google or its parent company's C-suite, but instead the company offered a lieutenant. Not good enough, say Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner...</p><p>A source familiar with the committee's negotiations with Google told me that Google's unwillingness to send a senior executive was a rookie error. \"Here's the irony - this would've been an easy way for Google to win some goodwill. Pichai could've sat there, looking cooperative, while Facebook and Twitter took the vast majority of the incoming [questions from senators],\" the source said.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My take: The source is right -- Facebook takes a lot more heat on this topic than Google and Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180829reliable-sources-08-29-181</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T55-Y321-JBPX-W159-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><timeReceived>9:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Friday morning -- everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday. It is Friday, September 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fireworks on Capitol Hill -- the Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote this morning on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. This, after he and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, told their stories yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Let's go back to the incident. What is the strongest memory you have?</p><p>CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, KAVANAUGH ACCUSER: In the hippocampus is the laughter -- the uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense.</p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations. The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, to the Supreme Court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More on the fiery testimony in just one minute. And we should tell you that ahead of this vote today, Senator Bob Corker has said he will vote yes for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>A suit for Musk; the Securities and Exchange Commission charging the Tesla CEO with misleading investors. Tesla is taking a hit in the premarket, stock is down 12.25 percent. Musk's response to the suit coming up.</p><p>Markets are lower this morning, take a look. Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning with a decline of about 60 points, that's a quarter of a percent. S&amp;P 500 also down a quarter of a percent, as is the Nasdaq with an 18.5 point decline.</p><p>This after all the major indices tacked on gains yesterday, up 54 points on the Dow and the S&amp;P was up eight points, and the Nasdaq at the close, up two-thirds of a percent, 51 points higher.</p><p>As we end the near of the second quarter, this is the last trading day of the third quarter. The Dow picked up almost 9 percent. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P up 7 percent for the third quarter.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the trading performance. FT 100 down 39 points half of a percent. CAC 40 is down three-quarters of a percent and the DAX index down 1.25 percent.</p><p>Asian markets this morning finishing mostly in positive territory, best performer Japan. Nikkei average up one and a third percent.</p><p>Google is in the hot seat today. The company's CEO is headed to Capitol Hill today for a close door meeting with lawmakers. This, amid charges that the search engine does not treat conservative voices fairly.</p><p>And barrels of trouble - why whiskey makers are saying that the trade tensions could put us in a bourbon burden.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining us to break it all down Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, along with Kadina Group president Gary B. Smith, and \"The Hill\" columnist, Fox News contributor Liz Peek. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP: Nice to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a day yesterday. We all watched.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the question going forward, we were talking about it in the break, what are the consequences of Republicans voting no on Brett Kavanaugh potentially.</p><p>To quote Kimberley Strassel's column in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"The Kavanaugh Stakes\". And I'll say this -- if a Republican votes against Brett Kavanaugh you are standing with the sleeze on the left. You're standing by ambush tactics. You're standing by the smears. And it has consequences not just for the man and his family but for the Supreme Court, the Senate, and the country at large.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right. I think this op-ed is so powerful this morning from Kim Strassel. And you're right. She goes through it and she basically says \"Any vote no, the stakes go even further to the core of the country's principles. To vote against Kavanaugh is to overthrow due process.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Overthrowing due process and essentially sending the message to the country that an individual believes all men are liars and all women are victims. Nobody buys that.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. Abandoning the presumption of innocence, which is sort of the bedrock of our judiciary system and everything else. I mean I think it's an appalling approval of character assassination as sort of the first line of defense.</p><p>This is all about the complexion of the court changing should Kavanaugh end up on the Supreme Court. It is not about what he did when he was a teenager. It's about basically losing an election in 2016 which allows President Trump to appoint a conservative justice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly what Lindsey Graham said yesterday. The Senator said exactly what so many people were thinking.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, White House senior advisor for strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp is here. Revolution chairman and CEO and former AOL CEO Steve Case is here. Economist Nouriel Roubini will join us. And former White House press secretary under President Trump, Sean Spicer is here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>And we kick it off right here -- an emotionally-charged day on Capitol Hill yesterday. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh publicly testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee over sexual harassment allegations. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FORD: Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life for a very long time. I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone these details. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell you the truth.</p><p>LEAHY: Then let's go back to the incident. What is the strongest memory you have?</p><p>FORD: Indelible in hippocampus is the laughter -- the uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense.</p><p>SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?</p><p>FORD: 100 percent.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I'm here today to tell the truth. I've never sexually assaulted anyone. I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family.</p><p>The other night, Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little Liza, all 10 years old said to Ashley we should pray for the woman -- a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old.</p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Are Dr. Ford's allegations true?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: They're not accurate as to me. I have not questioned that she might have been sexually assaulted at some point in her life by someone, some place, but as to me, I've never done this.</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you swear to God?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I swear to God.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This coming as Republican Senator Bob Corker says he will be voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. We are waiting on the others and that vote. The committee vote is today at 9:30.</p><p>Joining us right now two New York representatives -- Republican Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. Congresswomen -- great to see you both. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK: Thank you.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman Maloney -- I want to begin with you. You waited for Judge Kavanaugh's arrival yesterday with actress Alyssa Milano. Why were you with Alyssa Milano?</p><p>MALONEY: I went over to see the hearing. She happened to be there. At first, Senator Feinstein said I had a ticket. And then they moved to a much smaller room. She said I did not have a ticket. There would be four seats for members of Congress and I came very early to make sure that I had one of those seats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She was recording the hearing. Is that against rules?</p><p>MALONEY: I really don't know. I did not know she was recording it. But I assume everywhere I go I'm being recorded now on these phones.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. She was --</p><p>MALONEY: And obviously she didn't have to record it. You recorded it. Everyone recorded it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. You're not supposed to record it from inside the courtroom, you know that, right? You're a congresswoman. She was asked to stop and she did in fact comply.</p><p>MALONEY: Well, you should ask her about it. I don't know anything about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the hearing yesterday?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, I thought it was riveting. And I thought Dr. Ford gave a very sincere, honest, authentic testimony that was tremendously moving. And Brett Kavanaugh also gave a very emotional testimony that was incredibly partisan and attacking against Democrats.</p><p>Usually in these confirmation hearings they talk about the law, they talk about working together for the future of the country. It was a partisan attack on -- the most partisan testimony I've ever heard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A partisan testimony on the Democrats' part?</p><p>MALONEY: On Judge Kavanaugh's part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman Tenney, your thoughts?</p><p>TENNEY: Look, I thought they were both very believable. I thought that she seemed to be sincere. But I think this is really important. It comes down to credibility. And I don't think taken as a whole the evidence surrounding what brought her to the hearing in the first place was credible.</p><p>I think that she -- if Senator Feinstein really cared about this woman and sexual assault is a very, very serious issue. As a lawyer I have encountered this many times with many of my clients. She would have brought this immediately to law enforcement or the FBI to do an investigation. Instead, they held it.</p><p>So all of that moving testimony was really not credible and I respectfully disagree with my colleague who is a terrific member of my committee, this is -- Brett Kavanaugh is under attack. His family is under attack. He was defending himself against some of the worst kind of accusations against a person, dragging him through his high school days, a young man obviously very well accomplished. He's somebody who had a lot of fun but someone who also, you know, was very, very smart, did really well, participated in all kinds of sports and activities.</p><p>So I just thought it was a character assassination. I felt that Mr. Kavanaugh or Judge Kavanaugh was right to defend himself and his family.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that your father was a New York Supreme Court justice. You were a lawyer who has previously represented sexual assault victims so we wanted to get your take on that.</p><p>But I guess what strikes me is, Congresswoman Maloney, is the idea that you say it was this partisan attack and yet Ford remains unable to marshal as Kim Strassel writes, to marshal any evidence for her claim of sexual assault. There was no corroboration whatsoever of her claims of sexual assault. Did you not -- does that not strike you?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, first of all --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was there due process in this whole proceeding in your view?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, to answer your question, she originally wanted to be anonymous. That's why Senator Feinstein did not call for the FBI investigation in the beginning. But the minute that her identity became public, both Senator Feinstein and Dr. Ford have called for and support an FBI investigation.</p><p>There were a number of people there, according to her testimony, interview them. Let's have the FBI get together one set of facts, so that one set of facts are before the committee. And that is I think should be a fundamental -- we shouldn't move forward without an FBI investigation on her points and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALONEY: And I'd like to respond to what my friend and colleague has said about the assault on Brett Kavanaugh. Well, let's look at what she's gained from this. She's got death threats. She's literally had to move her family twice because of death threats. She really hasn't gotten anything out of this except for her belief in wanting integrity in the process for the appointment to the Supreme Court --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MALONEY: -- a lifetime appointment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She obviously truly believes that he was the one that did this to her and obviously whatever she went through is just horrible.</p><p>But you mentioned Dianne Feinstein. You know, she said she denied releasing the information from the letter and yet the \"Washington Post\" got the letter. I mean hers is the only office who had the letter. So it's rich to say, you know, I can't believe that, you know, she wanted to be anonymous and then all of a sudden she's not anonymous. When in fact, yes, she wanted to be anonymous but Feinstein's office sat on the letter for six weeks and then the \"Washington Post\" suddenly got it.</p><p>MALONEY: But she was anonymous in her tip to the \"Washington Post\". It was the -- it came out -- somehow the press found out and were --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Somehow but the only person who had the letter Feinstein's office so how somehow -- the press got it.</p><p>MALONEY: Well, I don't know how the press got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was leaked.</p><p>MALONEY: But I believe that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was leaked, probably by Feinstein's office.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY: -- Feinstein was listening to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono's campaign is apologizing this morning. She sent a fund raising e-mail during the Ford testimony, according to published news reports. The message reportedly said the money would be donated to organizations helping survivors of sexual assault. Your thoughts on that -- Congresswoman?</p><p>MALONEY: She has apologized. And I accept her apology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This whole idea of throwing due process out the window before anybody's allegations are corroborated -- Congresswoman Tenney, I wonder what your thoughts are in terms of what -- how this is resonating with the people.</p><p>TENNEY: Well, I certainly -- it's probably district by district. But I know I'm getting an overwhelming amount of concern on both sides about the process. And I don't disagree with my colleague, Representative Maloney. I think it was a terrible thing for both of these people to go through.</p><p>And unfortunately, Dianne Feinstein is the person, obviously you could see by the awkward moment in the testimony yesterday that, they probably did leak the memo and that maybe will come out at some point.</p><p>And so unfortunately, both of them were dragged through this process. And I think it was interesting, and you played the clip where Judge Kavanaugh recognized his own daughter feeling sympathy for Dr. Ford. And I did too when I was watching her.</p><p>I said as a woman and watching what she had been through -- but again, I go back to the big point is this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENNEY: Was she believable? Yes. Was it credible the way this was all put together? Do I believe she was probably a victim? Probably. Do I believe it's Brett Kavanaugh? I don't think so.</p><p>And I hate to admit that I also kept calendars when I was in high school and college because I was a very busy student as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENNEY: So this guy is an accomplished man. He should be confirmed. I think this was a charade. I think Lindsey Graham really highlighted it. I though he was the superstar last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. There were a lot of funny tactics. I think you would both agree.</p><p>Carolyn Maloney --</p><p>MALONEY: Thank you.</p><p>TENNEY: Well, I think we should have an FBI investigation and get to the facts and then move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman -- thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you very much for joining us. Both Claudia Tenney, Carolyn Maloney -- great to see you both, ladies. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Heartbreak in North Carolina, a body believed to be the missing six-year- old autistic boy has been found.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Tragic story -- Maria.</p><p>Search crews discovered the body of a child believed to be that missing autistic boy, Maddox Ritch. His body was found partially submerged in a creek about a mile from where Maddox was reported missing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT HELTON, GASTONIA POLICE CHIEF: I'm heartbroken. This is not the end that we had hoped for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: His father says the six-year-old ran off last Saturday while they were walking together in a park. Investigators are working to find out how the boy died, if there was any foul play involved. That investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Well, Audi's CEO reportedly on the verge of losing his job. Volkswagen is Audi's parent company and they're expected to fire Rupert Sadler as early as today. Sadler has been in jail since June over his alleged connections to the diesel emissions cheating scandal that began three years ago.</p><p>Shares of Volkswagen -- not a good year them -- they're down about 13 percent.</p><p>And you don't have to worry about running out of Kentucky bourbon. An industry trade group says distilleries last year pumped out 7.5 million barrels of aging whiskey. That is the most since 1972. But the good times might be over. An industry leader is warning that trade disputes in key overseas markets could mean global customers start drinking less. I guess then prices go down, right. We'll have more in the market.</p><p>Cheers to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up -- renewed trouble for Tesla. The stock is down big today. The latest controversy for CEO Elon Musk as the Securities and Exchange Commission files a lawsuit for fraud. That's coming up.</p><p>Then, medical training goes high tech. We're checking out the new robot that can bleed, scream and cry -- later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>More turmoil for Tesla -- this is big. The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Elon Musk for fraud over his tweet about taking the company private at $420, funding secured. The case raising questions about executives using social media to get news out.</p><p>Joining me right now is Steve Case. He is the chairman and CEO of Revolution. And he's the former CEO of AOL. Steve -- it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, REVOLUTION: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a lot happening on Capitol Hill with some of your colleagues in the business, speaking to lawmakers.</p><p>But first, let me get your reaction to what's happening with Elon Musk and Tesla with this SEC lawsuit.</p><p>CASE: Well Elon is obviously one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. I have great respect for what he's been building with Tesla and SpaceX and so many other things. But I think -- and I obviously support that CEOs should use social media and the Internet to reach out to customers and other constituencies and, you know, kind of tell their stories.</p><p>But I do think there's a number of examples now where maybe Elon, by his own admission, probably should get a little more sleep and probably should be a little more careful before he tweets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean a lot of discussion this morning about what happens to Tesla if Elon Musk is not there. I mean he's, you know, being sued by the SEC. They're saying we are looking for him to not be able to serve as the CEO of a public company. Your thoughts on Tesla -- can it survive without Elon Musk?</p><p>CASE: Well, I'm sure it could. People said could Apple survive without Steve jobs. But clearly, Elon has been a key part of Tesla so hopefully this is a bump in the road and over time they'll resolve this issue and Elon will be able to kind of focus on taking Tesla and some of his other companies to the next level.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Steve -- let me switch gears and ask you about Google on Capitol Hill today. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to meet with top GOP lawmakers today. You know, that this comes amid growing scrutiny against the company and many social media sites for alleged biased search results, violations of policy, renewed relationship with China as it relates to Google specifically.</p><p>I spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday. He'll be meeting with Pichai today. Here's what he tells me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I mean he's committed to coming to a hearing this year, which is a change of where Google has been. I'm concerned because 90 percent of all searches go through Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ninety percent.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. And 95 percent of everybody drops off by that second page. So that first page matters a lot. Their real concerns are the conservative voices being able to come across. And I think transparency is key.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that -- Steve? Google is doing 90 percent of all search.</p><p>CASE: Obviously it's been a huge success. We were early supporters when I was running AOL. We did a deal with Google at one point, I own about 5 percent of Google. When it was a little company, it was just, you know, Larry and Sergey and a few other people.</p><p>Now it's 100,000 employees and has a huge impact obviously globally, both in terms of how people get information and also being a significant part of the advertising market. It's not surprising therefore that there's more scrutiny, more attention.</p><p>I'm glad Google is going to be in Washington today to talk about what they're doing. And think about what the role of these big platforms is. And as I say, it's not surprising that there's more of a backlash against big tech or backlash against Silicon Valley. I predicted it almost three years ago.</p><p>I wrote the book, \"The Third Wave\" because as these platforms become bigger and have more impact and in some cases -- in the face of Facebook maybe even influence the election -- it's not surprising there's nor scrutiny. I think there will be more entrepreneurs in this third wave of the Internet when you're dealing with health care and food and other smart cities.</p><p>Policies are going to matter more. Regulations are going to matter more. It's not just about the disruptive entrepreneurs going, you know, focusing on technology in Silicon Valley. It's also engaging in a respectful and responsive way with the policy makers in Washington, Brussels and other places.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's absolutely. And therein lies the problem, right. Because when you were talking about when you were an investor in Google, a small company -- today as you say 100,000 employees, 90 percent of all search results. Do you feel a new tone in terms of the regulatory environment that we could see perhaps calls for this company to be broken up? Or is this sort of the regular way the pendulum swings and you remember what happened with Microsoft, when Microsoft was a real target because of its size and its influence. These companies are more powerful today than ever before.</p><p>CASE: They are very powerful. I was part of the whole Microsoft issue when I was running AOL and some of the anti-trust issues. I was even deposed on that trial when the government was basically challenging Microsoft.</p><p>At the time, they had something like 95 percent market share in operating systems with Windows and there was a concern by the government which I shared that they were doing some things that were not necessarily, you know, supportive of entrepreneurs and others in the ecosystem in terms of what they wanted to do to innovate.</p><p>Ultimately, you know, Microsoft decided to pull back. It was a little bit more careful, kind of self-regulated. And I think I think that is the best approach for these big companies, not just you know, Google but other companies, Facebook and Amazon and so forth.</p><p>But if they don't do that, there's no question that there will be more scrutiny. I think there should be more scrutiny because these companies are playing not just a significant role in our lives, and having a significant influence on our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>And now let's look at the AT&amp;TTime Warner merger. Nine state attorneys general are backing AT&amp;T as the Justice Department seeks to reverse the approval of the company's $85.5 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Your take on this deal and its impact.</p><p>CASE: Well, obviously I have some history with Time Warner since we merged AOL and Time Warner almost 20 years ago -- 19 years ago. A lot has changed since obviously.</p><p>I think the strategic logic of the deal, if they can figure out a way to run it in a more integrated kind of way kind of makes sense. I was a little surprised when the merger closed and then, you know, the government kind of filed this appeal. I think it's better if these things are resolved before things close as opposed to after things close. But we'll see how this stuff plays out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think they should allow this to go through?</p><p>CASE: I think they probably should have decided earlier if they really were going to have concerns about it. I think once -- again, I don't know all the details. I've been focusing on working with entrepreneurs in the middle of the country, not on thinking about what Time Warner and AT&amp;T should be doing in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let me ask you about that --- Steve.</p><p>CASE: But it seems like it should have been resolved earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're leading the Rise of the Rest Summit. This is a nationwide an effort to invest in entrepreneurship; help build businesses across the country. This is really an important part of the employment story in our country. Entrepreneurs and small business create the jobs. Tell us more about your effort.</p><p>CASE: It's very exciting. We launched this Rise of the Rest initiative over four years ago. But today we're in Chicago. Yesterday we had a hundred entrepreneurs from 50 different cities that are doing amazing things in sectors all across the economy. We brought them together to share perspective. A half a dozen of our investors that are partners, L.P.'s in the Rise of the Rest Fund, including Eric Schmidt, and you know, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer of Silicon Valley, Dan Gilbert from Detroit, Ted Leonsis from D.C., Brad Keywell from here and Chicago. They're all sharing perspectives on scaling companies.</p><p>We really believe the next wave of entrepreneurship is not going to just happen on the coast, it's going to happen all across the country. And you said, that's critical. Because the big job creators in our -- in our country are the young, high growth startups. And if we're only backing the startups on the coast -- last year, 75 percent of venture capital went to three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASE: While the other 47 states fight over 25 percent. So, big states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, get less than one percent.</p><p>So, we need to back the entrepreneurs there, creating the jobs there to offset the disruption of technology that's happening on the coast which will continue to happen with A.I., robotics, driverless trucks. They're going to destroy jobs in the middle of the country if we don't offset that at least in part by backing on entrepreneurs in the middle of the country to create jobs in the middle of the country.</p><p>That somewhat, some of the challenges we have right now including on the -- on the political front are going to worsen. There are a lot of people in this country -- the majority of the country by some estimates are anxious and fearful of the future. They don't view innovation as a good thing or disruption as a good thing. They view it as a bad thing. It's going to end up potentially destroying their jobs or their communities.</p><p>So, we need to make sure we understand that startups play a critical role. We need to level the playing field so everybody, everywhere really has a shot at the American dream. And we're creating jobs all across the country, not just on the coast.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. So, you just say three states get the majority of what, private equity?</p><p>CASE: 75 percent -- venture capitalist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Venture capital.</p><p>CASE: If you look at the venture capital dollars, according to the NBC at a Venture Capital Association last year 75 percent went to just three states. Actually, (INAUDIBLE) they cover --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's amazing.</p><p>CASE: 90 percent of the venture capital went to men, less than 10 percent to women.</p><p>So, we have some work to do to make sure we're backing every entrepreneur everywhere. That's what Rise the rest is all about, and these hundred entrepreneurs. It's really gratifying and exciting to hear their stories yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic.</p><p>CASE: -- when all these partisanship and all this you know, challenges in the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASE: The entrepreneurs are going to lead the way forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it. Steve Case, good to see you, sir.</p><p>CASE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Friday morning. Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, September 28th. Your top stories right now 07:35 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The testimonies are in. Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testifying on Capitol Hill yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER: The details that -- about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.</p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I swear today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote based on their testimonies this morning at 9:30 a.m. So far, we know that Republican Senator Bob Corker has said he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh as did Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>Futures this morning show the markets will open lower. We are at the lows of the morning right here, Dow Industrials down 90 points, that's a third of a percent. S&amp;P also down a third of a percent, as is the NASDAQ with a decline of 30 points.</p><p>These after the major indices finished higher yesterday. As you can see, gains across the board, NASDAQ best performer, up two thirds of a percent yesterday, up 51 points.</p><p>As we wrap up the third quarter, the DowIndustrials is up almost nine percent for the quarter. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 up seven percent for the third quarter. Of course, the fourth quarter begins on Monday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the markets are lower. Take a look. FT-100 down three quarters of one percent. The CAC Quarante is down better than one percent. And the DAX Index is down 1-2/3 percent right now.</p><p>Asian markets finished mostly positive with the exception of Korea as you can see.</p><p>A terror plot was foiled overseas, we have the incredible footage of police nabbing a group of terror suspects armed with suicide vests and assault rifles.</p><p>Plus, recall alert. We've got the details on why Honda is recalling more than 200,000 vehicles. The malfunction that could put you in danger.</p><p>And meet HAL, he's the incredible and realistic robot that's helping train the next generation of medical professionals. He'll be here in studio with us in just a few minutes. You've got to meet HAL. Stay with us on that.</p><p>But first, the top story this half an hour, meeting postponed. The White House announcing yesterday that President Trump will not be meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until next week. This as fox is just confirming conservative GOP leaders in the House have reached a deal to bring in Rosenstein for a closed door session meeting to discuss the New York Times story about potentially recording the president and invoking the 25th amendment to remove President Trump. It is not clear, however, if Rosenstein will respond to that congressional request.</p><p>Joining us right now is former White House press secretary under President Trump, Senior advisor and spokesperson for America First Action PAC and the author of The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President, Sean Spicer. Sean, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, SENIOR ADVISOR AND SPOKESPERSON, AMERICA FIRST ACTION PAC: You bet. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your take on President Trump's meeting with his deputy attorney general?</p><p>SPICER: I think it's an important meeting. Obviously you need to make sure that there's a chemistry and relationship and a degree of trust by those you appoint and those are executing important duties throughout your administration. But the president rightly postponed this in light of the other news that's going on with respect to the Supreme Court.</p><p>But you know, look, I think that there's a lot about how this thing went down in terms of the reporting of it, whether it was -- whether it happened at all, whether it was a joke, an offended comment that was taken out of context. And I think the president needs to sit down as he's going to do with Mr. Rosenstein and say explain yourself to me, what happened, what did you mean, did it really happen? And there's a lot of extremes that go into that question. Either it really didn't happen or it did happen. And if it did happen, was he joking around and you know, what was the context in which it was said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because there's more to it, right, Sean? I mean, Rod Rosenstein was the one who signed off on the third FISA warrant to wiretap Carter Page. He wrote a letter to fire Jim Comey and then was upset with the president when the president said that's one of the reasons why he fired him.</p><p>And of course, he's been sitting on documents that congress wants to investigate how they came up with this narrative that Trump had anything to do with the Russia meddling.</p><p>SPICER: Right. And I think I'll go back to what I said initially Maria, which is, look, these are people that have been appointed by the president of the United States to serve in his administration. He was elected by the American people. And that if these people don't feel comfortable with the policies and agenda that he has, then they have an obligation to resign.</p><p>And so, I think the president needs to be able to look in this case Mr. Rosenstein in the eye and say explain yourself to me. If you're not doing what I have asked you to do in terms of the Department of Justice and the actions and policies that I want implemented, then you need to go. You should not be undermining me or opposing this agenda in any way, shape or form. And so, that's a conversation that the two of them need to have.</p><p>But as you mentioned, all those aforementioned issues are important and I think we need to make it clear, that these aren't independent agencies that can go do whatever they want. They are appointed to serve and execute the policies and agenda of the president of the United States.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, its Liz Peek. Good morning. It does seem to me that the president is somewhat boxed in. In other words, this has been an incredibly compromising news story about Rosenstein. The question is, if he gets rid of Rosenstein, who is next? I mean, is there a succession possibility here that's going to satisfy supporters of President Trump?</p><p>SPICER: Well, I mean, obviously the president selects those individuals. So, I don't know that they have a succession plan in place right now. But I'm sure that there's a ton of qualified individuals either within the department that could be elevated and nominated to that position. Noel Francisco who's the number of the current Solicitor General I think by statute and order would take over certain aspects of the job.</p><p>But I think there's a fundamental threshold question that needs to get asked first, which is, you know, whether or not the aspects of this New York Times story were accurate in the first place. So, I'm less worried about the replacement than I am about the nut of the story.</p><p>And as I mentioned at the outset, I think there's a big difference between whether it happened at all and then sort of the degrees, if it happened, was its an offhanded joke that is trying to make Mr. Rosenstein look bad in the eyes of the president knowing that something like this might tick him off.</p><p>So, I think first and foremost before we start talking about replacements, we need to understand the context of the story and whether or not any of the aspects are true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. We want to turn to the House Judiciary Committee. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a subpoena for the memos related to the former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the so called McCabe memos, writing to attorney general Jeff Sessions this. Given the department's ongoing delays and or refusal to produce these documents, I'm left with no choice but to issue the enclosed subpoena to compel their production.</p><p>What effect is this going to have do you think -- we've seen subpoenas before. Are we going to see these memos?</p><p>SPICER: Well, I hope so. We're not talking about necessarily putting them in the public domain. But the members have a right, a constitutional right to oversight and the idea that a Republican House is being stymied by a Republican run Department of Justice --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SPICER: -- is mind boggling. So, I don't know why it's taking Chairman Goodlatte to go to the length of a subpoena. They should be able to come to terms privately and meet in closed session, or however -- you know, whatever form is appropriate to review these things. But this is somewhat out of -- out of norm that you have the same party having this discussion. So I think it's -- I would behoove the Department of Justice to work with Chairman Goodlatte and the Republican leadership in the House to satisfy this requests.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Maybe they just don't want to see what's in these memos, right? Because what did Trey Gowdy say Dagen, that it's an embarrassment because we're going to actually see how they came up with this idea that Trump had anything to do with the Russia scandal.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: An embarrassment to John Brennan. (INAUDIBLE) And he didn't think that there was anything new in there for the most part. That's not going to be any great shockers in the memos.</p><p>SPICER: And the thing -- the other thing that I would add in this is that, for all these people who constantly are crying about transparency, here we have another instance of trying to get more information to understand what's going on and it seems that so many people are actually trying to prevent us from having a greater understanding of what's really going on. For all the people who care about Russia and this collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SPICER: Well, here's another way to find out what's the basis of this, what is that information. We're not -- again, we're not talking about putting it out publicly. It's members of Congress exercising their constitutional responsibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, and this speaks volumes, doesn't it?</p><p>SPICER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sean, thank you so much.</p><p>SPICER: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sean Spicer joining us.</p><p>Coming up, a major terror plot was foiled. The developments after police in the Netherlands arrest seven suspects.</p><p>Then, a huge recall for Honda to report. Details on the automakers malfunctions software in certain vehicles. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Get this, police in the Netherlands foiling a major terrorist plot. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, this as an amazing video and it shows the dramatic moment Maria, when heavily armed Dutch police, check this out, they arrested terrorists suspects in a raid in a parking lot. Authorities say there were seven men who planned to use suicide vests, assault rifles and car bombs targeting at least two locations. Fortunately that attack foiled. About 400 officers took part in a series of raids. There they are. The alleged ring leader of 34 old Iraqi was previously convicted of attempting to travel overseas to join extremist groups.</p><p>Well, a recall from Honda this morning, about 232,000 2018 Accords and 2019 Insight hybrid in the U.S. could have a software problem. The rear camera display doesn't work when the cars are put into reverse. Honda says there have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to this potential problem. Shares of the company down 11 percent this year.</p><p>And we are getting the first glimpse of Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers for the upcoming movie about the beloved children's show host. Looks pretty good. The photo Sony has released shows a gray haired hanks in Rogers signature red sweater. That was the sweater he wore on Mr. Rogers neighborhood. The film will follow the story of a reporter who developed an emotional bond with Rogers while profiling him for a magazine. Production started this month. It hits theaters next October. I loved that show growing up, that red sweater, I forgot all about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. Taking the shoes off. Thank you, Lauren. Coming up, talk about a realistic robot. Check this out, we got details on a new machine that can bleed, scream and cry and HAL the robot is in studio. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The future of medical training may be in the hands of robots. Gaumard Scientific has created HAL, a realistic child robot for medical training that can cry, bleed and react like a real child patient. We have HAL here on the set today.</p><p>And joining me right now is Gaumard Scientific corporate planning vice president James Archetto and Dr. Mikhail Varshavski also known as Dr. Mike. Great to see everybody. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>James, let me start with you. Tell us about HAL and what was the inspiration for creating HAL?</p><p>JAMES ARCHETTO, CORPORATE PLANNING VICE PRESIDENT, GAUMARD SCIENTIFIC: HAL is really designed Maria for training physicians, nurses, first responders. What we want is physicians and health care practitioners to really be prepared for those critical situations with patients before they ever get there. So this is a chance for them to really learn a clinically accurate patient.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how does HAL do that?</p><p>ARCHETTO: HAL does that by the combination of electronics, software and hydraulics inside. So you can see his eyes are moving now. He has facial expressions.</p><p>And the reason for that, is physicians get a lot of information from that and 5-year-olds don't always talk and don't always provide that information verbally. So, we had to do it in a way with several motors and electronics and software.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Mike, you're a practicing doctor. We're seeing the video of HAL getting blood taken from him.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE: Yes, I mean, when I was training we didn't have simulations this real. We had a basic dummy that didn't move. And you'd be doing chest compressions, he's best you would hear a click to know that you were doing chest compressions in the right way. Here, it sounds like you have the entire picture. You have the emotional feedback. You have visual feedback. You can do procedures on him.</p><p>And when you -- I know, you mentioned earlier in one of the segments that you don't want him to look too realistic. Because you were worried about being traumatic to medical students. What was traumatic to me as a medical student was going into my first surgery rotation and not knowing what to do because I didn't have experience on such a high level simulator.</p><p>So, having this experience, knowing how to do the procedures, being able to look at a child and seeing it react back and forth with me, that's priceless.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How will you react, though? I mean, James, walk us through some of the medical scenarios that HAL can actually replicate.</p><p>ARCHETTO: Sure. Let's say that a child goes into respiratory distress, asthmatic on a plain field. For example, playing soccer goes in -- has an asthmatic attack, goes into respiratory distress. HAL will respond appropriately to that. He can actually be intubated to help him breathe. If he goes into cardiac arrest, he can be defibrillated with real energy.</p><p>So, as Dr. Mike was describing, those real clinical experiences can take place right here on HAL. And you know, so, I'm controlling him from a tablet here. He's not plugged in. He's completely untethered Maria because accidents take place wherever not always in the hospital.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this would be helpful to you?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: So, this would be helpful to everybody. Because we're talking about nurses, we're talking about first responders, we're talking about training physicians. And in reality, you never know what to expect in the situations. So, the more simulations you can be put in as a trainee, the better you're going to react when the time comes to make a decision.</p><p>Because it's really traumatic in the scene of an injury, in the scene of someone having an asthma attack, your mind starts racing. And if you don't have experience with a simulated patient before that, it makes it really hard to make the right decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the downside risk here, James? I mean, I understand the benefits of having HAL as you very articulately -- as you very articulated it, but is there a downside here? I mean, robots are getting better and better and better.</p><p>ARCHETTO: Yes, remember, his objective is training. He's an educational aide to facilitate folks like Dr. Mike in their training experience. So from that standpoint, the objective is to really focus on those clinical experiences.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, the hair is really amazing. Look at this. This is great. Great stuff, guys. Thanks very much, James Archetto, Dr. Mike, great -- a pleasure. Thank you, HAL.</p><p>ARCHETTO: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really interesting. An education every day.</p><p>Still ahead, renewed trouble for Tesla, the latest controversy for CEO Elon Musk after the Securities and Exchange Commission sues him for fraud, that's next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

A PR lady is nervously keeping his schedule in check. Hilton, true to his form as the man who introduced open-necked shirts to the Conservative tribe, is in hipster orange trousers and a ragged T-shirt, head carefully shorn to highlight blazing blue eyes. If he looks a bit like an off-duty Buddhist monk, Hilton is also a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of ad-man Maurice Saatchi, with a talent for causing a stir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Promoting his book, More Human: Designing a World in Which People Come First, he's already thrown a cat among the pigeons with his take on the way staid democracies and entrenched power structures block real change: \"Regardless of who's in office, the same people are in power. It is a democracy in name only, operating on behalf of a tiny elite no matter the electoral outcome.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You have to wonder how this went down over Sunday lunch at the weekend with his old mate <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>at the Prime Minister's constituency home in Oxfordshire in a week when the Tories were congratulating themselves on their election win. </p><p>Hilton is one of the old Cameroon inner circle, close to David and Samantha even in his exile in San Francisco, where he has lived since 2012 with his wife, Rachel Whetstone - another former Tory staffer who has just left a senior job at Google to join Uber, the American app-based taxi service. The couple were godparents to the Camerons' late disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009.</p><p>\"I've known Dave for so long that he knows everything I think so he wouldn't be remotely surprised,\" Hilton replies, though he adds diplomatically that \"Dave is someone who is very human as well as being PM with all that entails.\"</p><p>He did agree to delay publication of the book until after the election, on the grounds that anything he said as a former chief aide (and architect of the 2010 manifesto) could be used against his old friend. </p><p>The tome is a well-written, often disarmingly frank scoping of the shortcomings of modern governance and businesses and it reveals Hilton's strength as a mixture of insider and free thinker. </p><p>But some might see an irony in the complaints about the perpetuation of elites: \"The inhumanity of much modern life, in schools, hospitals and in urban planning, is no concern of the elites because they (we) don't have to experience it. Our children go to private schools, we supplement our NHS care with private insurance and we eat organic food from Waitrose ... for most people though the current system isn't working.\"</p><p>Isn't there just a self-selecting element prominently represented in his old friend's No 10 circle? He chooses his words carefully: \"It's a human thing to want to spend time with people you know well.\"</p><p>Hilton's underlying diagnosis sounds a lot more like - dare I say it - gloomy Ed Miliband-ism than <person><nameText>David Cameron's</nameText></person>\u00a0 upbeat claim that modern Conservatism can serve all groups well. Hilton replies firmly that the problems of \"inhuman\" public services are better dealt with by Tory-led innovation and decentralisation (his mantra for addressing overly controlled, people-hostile bureaucracies in health, education and welfare).</p><p>Some trenchant criticisms strike a chord, especially on education. He thinks the tyranny of PISA tests and over-centralisation of exam systems is producing school-leavers \"fit for the last century, not for the more innovative world we live in\".</p><p>Occasionally, there are glaring contradictions. He thinks academies and free schools will fix this. I point out that the main concern of academies at the moment is a shift from the established GCSE system to a new scale of grading the year after next that absorbs teachers' efforts and unsettles parents and children to no obviously good end. \"That's terrible,\" says Hilton with feeling. \"It isn't the education system I'd design.\"</p><p>The Gove reforms which defined the last government's approach to education get a rather mixed review. \"The Soviet comparison is an apt one - using central command to try and run a vast system. Of course you can squeeze some results out of it and muster some sign schools are improving. But is it the big transformation we want to see to prepare for the 21st century? No, and look at the cost to wellbeing and mental health - I don't just mean the children but the parents too - from an over-examined, over-centralised approach?\" </p><p>He has a particular loathing for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Pisa tests. \"Ridiculous. Totally absurd and as damaging for education systems as measuring GDP is for balanced public policy.\" </p><p>He says a new education secretary should \"go further in de-centralising and give more powers to head teachers\". More striking, he continues to defend the idea of for-profit schools, one of the big reformist ideas that his Tory colleagues have never seriously pursued.</p><p>\"I never understood how, when if so many businesses can make a profit delivering services and products to state education, you could not take it further and allow for-profit operators to run some schools\". He thinks \"most people care about good outcomes, not whether something is for-profit or not. </p><p>Some Hiltonesque ideas have bitten the dust, notably his brief \"Greening\" of the Tories. Does he regret that? \"For me it was always more about local parks, beaches, countryside and nature - not so much carbon targets and climate change\".\u00a0 </p><p>Let us pinch ourselves. He was, after all,\u00a0 the man who persuaded Cameron to hug a husky before 2010 to highlight his concern about global warming and its effect on the Arctic, which sounds\u00a0 a strange way to pursue a cleaner beaches drive. I don't get the feeling that the fate of Tory Greenery is his favourite topic.</p><p>I wonder how much the thought of Boris in the House as a possible successor to Cameron excites him? Not so much. \"I haven't given it much thought\".</p><p>Related stories</p><p>Hilton thinks much of the concentration of power in elites \"wouldn't matter so much if everything wasn't run from London, because they'd have competition elsewhere\". I wonder if that also applied to the big tech companies, such as Google, criticised for their own brand of high-handedness towards both old media and new entrants? He bristles a bit (the Google spousal loyalty is taking a while to wear off), but admits that disruptive tech companies can end up looking rather more like established corporate hierarchies than is healthy.</p><p>I suspect he relies a bit too much on blaming the \"bureaucracy\" or \"the way we run systems overall\" for things that elected politicians of whatever stripe could tackle, were they prepared to forego a transient advantage. </p><p>He makes the very shrewd point, for instance, that policy reforms often treat people as \"abstractions, rather than individuals\" and then wonder why they fail to respond to incentives. But that applies in spades to the kind of welfare reform sold on peripheral detail such as the \"bedroom tax\" on people in large council flats or on limiting the number of children they should have if they make a claim on the state's largesse. It does not exactly sound like the most hands-on, personal approach. </p><p>\"I think it's an example of an approach where and there is a limit to what that can achieve,\" he concedes. He thinks more targeted measured, such as identifying troubled families and targeting solutions on them, works better.</p><p>These days, Hilton runs Crowdpac, a start-up designed to dilute the power of big donors in the US by informing voters about candidates they might support, reflect their values or preferred campaigns. The relationship between business and government seems to trouble him. \"It's not about individual donors, it's about the system that concentrates power,\" he insists. Wasn't he invited to big donor Tory events in his Number 10 heyday? \"I wasn't invited, as I recall\". </p><p>Between 2010 and 2012 in Downing Street Hilton inspired many, like his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close friend, the entrepreneur Rohan de Silva, who is hosting Hilton's book launch party tonight in Hoxton. Naturally.</p><p>Part of the appeal of Hilton, apart from the fertile brain and the boundless energy, was the Boho vibe he brought to the formal Cameron world. Does he miss his W11 life, the days of salon young Tories, and cycling around sockless, puffing on a Marlboro? </p><p>We were, I recall, once debarred from the classy environs of an All Bar One because Hilton was deemed unsuitably well dressed to join the better class of after-work lager consumer. I ask if he misses the freewheeling years. He says quite firmly that he doesn't.\u00a0 </p><p>\"Everything I do now I owe in some way to Rachel,\" he says. \"She opened up California to me and I've truly never been happier\". It sounds more than dutiful to his high-powered wife, currently trying to sort out Uber's regulatory and image issues.</p><p>It's the first time he's talked of Whetstone's high-profile move earlier this month from the top table of Google to Uber. \"A lot of people would have stayed in the same position and not taken a risk. But Rachel went for a new challenge and I'm so proud of that,\" he adds.\" </p><p>I wonder how this hyper-achieving family manage to do the ordinary stuff that having two boys aged four and seven demands. \"We organise things so that Rachel and I aren't out of town much at the same time and we try to spend weekends together and one of us home for bedtime.\"</p><p>Still, I venture that the couple must spend a lot of time staring at their respective screens. \"I don't have a smart phone,\" he admits. \"I didn't have one when I arrived in the US, and somehow life has continued. I teach at Stanford University, I launched a tech company - miraculously, it all seems to work without a phone!\"</p><p>There must be days, I venture, when he looks at the pool house and villa among the tech-super rich and wonders like the chap in the Talking Heads song Once in a Lifetime, \"How did I get here?\"</p><p>Hilton suddenly looks steely. \"I don't really care much about what the top one per cent earn. The gap we ought to care about in wealth is between the middle and the bottom. The problem is the sections of society who feel they are not getting somewhere, not those who do.\"</p><p>He doesn't believe Silicon Valley is overpaid. \"Rachel works unbelievably hard and is utterly dedicated to what she does at any time and she's earned everything she has. The tech sector is so fast-changing that no one rests on their laurels. As for me, I'm on the lower rungs, doing something I believe in - so I'm not in the top per cent by a long way\".</p><p>There are no immediate plans for a return to Blighty. Anything he relishes on returning to his old city? \"The Tube!\" he enthuses. \"A public transport system that works. We haven't got one of those where I live. Fantastic!\"</p><p>Anne McElvoy is Senior Editor at The Economist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-20430140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G1B-DN51-F021-62XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1789\"/><timeReceived>12:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>May 19, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Steve King is threatening to use the \"Teddy Roosevelt step\" against U.S. tech companies.</p><p>The Iowa Republican drew national headlines last week for an embarrassing interaction with Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. King demanded answers after explaining his granddaughter recently was exposed to an attack ad against him while she was playing with a mobile device.</p><p> \"How does that show up on a 7-year-old's iPhone, who's playing a kids game?\" King asked.</p><p> \"Congressman, iPhone is made by a different company,\" Pichai explained.</p><p> \"It might have been an Android,\" King said.</p><p> It was an almost perfect demonstration of the gap in knowledge between those who are frustrated by new technology those who embrace it. King reminded us of friends struggling to explain a non-existent \"glitch.\" My own mother, who is relatively tech savvy, has done the same thing. The difference is she is not trying to write laws.</p><p> That scuffle exposed an important point \u2014 the people most eager to impose new rules on the tech industry often lack practical knowledge about how technology works.</p><p> However, it also shadowed King's more troubling comments. During the hearing, he renewed his pledge to explore a set of overbearing government interventions into private business practices.</p><p> King and others are worried that the gatekeepers of digital content are systematically blocking conservative viewpoints. King said Google has a \"built-in bias,\" since its engineers live in liberal California, and the company doesn't monitor their social media accounts for left-wing posts.</p><p> How do the tech companies do it? King tried to explain algorithms at another committee hearing this year.</p><p> \"If a certain word shows up, that sets up a software alarm bell, perhaps connected with another word or two or a phrase, that would cause it automatically to be kicked out. Is that a fair explanation of what goes on?\" King asked Google and Facebook staffers in June.</p><p> That's not how it works, tech leaders insist, and there are no alarm bells.</p><p> Nevertheless, King's preferred remedy is bigger government. He has repeatedly flirted with the idea that the government should treat tech companies as public utilities, mandating open access for all legal purposes.</p><p> \"Is there any difference in your mind between say, Facebook, and Twitter and YouTube \u2014 those, we'll call them utilities, not necessarily public utilities, but utilities \u2014 is there any difference between them and, let's say, UPS and FedEx?\" King asked conservative media personalities during yet another hearing on the subject this year.</p><p> Now King is openly pondering a \"Teddy Roosevelt-style break-up,\" invoking the president who is most remembered for cracking down on large corporations under antimonopoly laws.</p><p> The consequences of King's idea would be vast and largely unforeseeable. The internet has thrived under light-touch regulations and, contrary to King's observation, there is ample space for all viewpoints. This kind of talk should make free-market conservatives squeamish.</p><p> \u2022 Comments: (319) 339-3156; <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:adam.sullivan@thegazette.com\">adam.sullivan@thegazette.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Republican Rep.

Thank you so much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you so much.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST, LOU DOBBS TONIGHT: Good evening, everybody. President Trump energetically rallying his enthusiastic supporters in Battle Creek, Michigan and around the country for that matter last night while the Democratic Party today did what it has done for the past three years: They stared again into the abyss as both the radical Dems and the leftist media concocted more bizarre and sinister narratives.</p><p>Speaker Pelosi declared she would hold up the Articles of Impeachment the Dems had passed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today declared Pelosi to be afraid to send those shoddy articles to the Senate.</p><p>How did investors and markets react to all of this dire political theater? By moving to new record heights.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, in the midst of it all, all the low drama also passed President Trump's USMCA, the new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, $1.3 trillion worth as a matter of fact.</p><p>In the midst of all the political turmoil, the radical Dems' subversion for more than three years, President Trump succeeded in delivering another of his major campaign promises, continuing to balance and make reciprocal U.S. trade.</p><p>And with House Speaker Pelosi's decision to delay delivery of those Articles of Impeachment to the Senate and with the House now adjourned for the holidays, there won't be any action until early January.</p><p>The President maintaining that the Dems entire process is a hoax, a setup and that the Republicans are now winning because of Pelosi's outright default.</p><p>Our next guest has been a key actor in spending negotiations, as well as all of his other duties in his portfolio as Secretary of the Department of Treasury. Joining us tonight is Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, great to have you with us. I want to begin first of all, congratulations on the spending package. Secondly, USMCA. Thirdly, and perhaps we could rearrange the order of the China-U.S. Phase 1 deal. It's been a busy week for you, but with your portfolio, I know you're not surprised at what can be done in a week. Great to have you with us.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Thanks, Lou. It's great to be with you as well. And as you said, it's been a great week for President Trump's economic plan and we couldn't be happier with getting appropriations done.</p><p>It's a lot of money for the military, big investment in our military. The President got the Space Force and a lot of wins for the President in this bill.</p><p>DOBBS: And the American people -- this has been extraordinary. And I think there is a sizable number of people and even some of them, Trump supporters who are surprised that, well, in modern history to have a President now who actually does what he says he will do, who delivers on campaign promises.</p><p>He said he was going to create prosperity for America and for all Americans, and by God, he has done so.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Absolutely. He is delivering on all his promises and he is building a great economy for American companies and American workers.</p><p>DOBBS: We're hearing a number of wags and you know, a friend of mine used to say every dog has his fleas, detractors, and with USMCA, we're hearing from some quarters that they think that this new deal isn't as good as the old deal. Your reaction when you read that kind of assessment?</p><p>MNUCHIN: I think they don't know what they're talking about. This deal is so much better than the old deal. I think this is going to add about 50 basis points of growth to GDP. This has all new types of things, all new types of protections. And I think Ambassador Lighthizer just did a fabulous job negotiating and closing this deal.</p><p>DOBBS: And going through all -- I mean, the works out to about $1.3 trillion. It's a larger deal than the than the U.S.-China trade deal that you and Ambassador Lighthizer have been working on for more than a year now. Are you where you think it should be? Is this the deal that the President is going to be satisfied with? Or is it going to take a lot more?</p><p>MNUCHIN: No, absolutely. Absolutely. Well, first of all, the USMCA, this has been a major priority for the President in making sure that we bring jobs back to the U.S. and I think this will absolutely accomplish it in making sure that we have great trading relationships with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>And on China, as you know, President Trump is the first President who has addressed this issue. This has been an issue both with the Republicans and Democrats, and the President just wants to have a level playing field and I think Phase 1 is an enormous step in the right direction.</p><p>We have intellectual property protection, we have financial services that are going to be opened up. We have a currency chapter. We have agricultural structural changes, and this is going to be great for our farmers. They're buying a lot of goods,</p><p>DOBBS: And importantly, the enforcement mechanism within this deal. Ambassador Lighthizer, the President, and you have all talked about that importance. How strong is the enforcement mechanism in Phase 1 as it stands now?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, it's very strong. The enforcement chapter is closed out. So this is the enforcement chapter that is going to be throughout the entire agreement and it is binding. It has a binding mechanism. And again, this is the first time we've ever had an agreement with China on the trade front that has a binding enforcement mechanism.</p><p>DOBBS: It strikes me that this President has done something that's -- first of all, it is historic, of course, the historic achievements are -- it's unprecedented. Because this is a President, ahead of the International Monetary Fund, ahead of the World Bank, any other organization in the country in the world, saying we're going to have balanced trade. We're going to have reciprocal trade.</p><p>And he has begun now to balance international trading relationships with China, USMCA, and let's not forget the agreement -- the trading agreement - - with Japan and South Korea. I mean, this has been a spectacular demonstration of a man leading all of the major financial institutions, as well as the regulatory and intermediaries around the globe.</p><p>MNUCHIN: You're a hundred percent correct, Lou, and the President has been very clear, he wants free trade, but it has got to be free and fair and reciprocal. And in the case of China, our markets had been open to them. Their markets have not been opened us. And this Phase 1 agreement is about rebalancing it.</p><p>DOBBS: You use the expression he wants free trade. I once had a discussion with Larry Kudlow on this. I've never heard the President talk about free trade. I've heard him talk about fair and reciprocal trade.</p><p>Free trade connotes four decades of failure in terms of managing balances. In terms of reciprocity, it represents 50 years of consecutive trade deficits. I haven't heard the expression, frankly, free trade for months now, perhaps a year or so, until the deal is done and now it's starting to be constructed a bit.</p><p>And correct me if I'm wrong, a free trade deal, I think it's more a fair and reciprocal trade deal. Straighten me out.</p><p>MNUCHIN: I don't think is this a free trade deal. I think this is a reciprocal trade deal. And, you know, the President has been very clear on reciprocal tariffs and reciprocal trade and balanced trade.</p><p>And from the first meeting we had with President Xi and President Trump, President Trump brought this up. He said, we need to have balanced trade. This has to be that it works in both directions and that was acknowledged by President Xi and we've been working on it for two years. We're going to be releasing the agreements soon. I think people will see this is a real agreement with real chapters and real enforcement.</p><p>DOBBS: And just a couple of things if I may before we wrap up here and I've just got to again, congratulate you, the President, the administration, and Ambassador Lighthizer. These -- I mean, it's astounding what has been achieved here.</p><p>I don't think much of the media is giving you the credit that you deserve because it is historic. It's extraordinary. I want to turn to first though the world's cash, hundred dollar bills, most of it disappearing and unaccounted for. And apparently there's a quest to find out what happened to one -- what is it? $1.5 trillion of $100.00 bills? What's going on?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, you know, it's interesting. I mean, the dollar is the reserve currency of the world, and everybody wants to hold dollars and the reason why they want to hold dollars is because the U.S. is a safe place to have your money to invest and to hold your assets in U.S. dollars.</p><p>And you know, it is interesting because in the world where everything is going digital and electronic payments, the demand for U.S. currency continues to go up. And literally, you know, a lot of these hundred dollar bills are sitting in bank vaults all over the world and particularly in a world of negative interest rates, you know, you can hold U.S. dollars, and you don't have to lose money. So there's a lot of Benjamin's all over the world.</p><p>DOBBS: Mr. Secretary, I'm going to do it again. I'm going to congratulate you on just a series of remarkable accomplishments and achievements. And we wish you all the very best as you try to top what has been an extraordinary year this 2019, have an even better 2020.</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary, thanks for being with us.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next. How the White House is working to bring affordable healthcare to all Americans. Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar joins us right after the break with that a great deal more. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Welcome back. E-cigarette maker, Juul suspending the sale of its fruity e-cigarette flavors. That's right. Fruity e-cigarette flavors ahead of an unexpected U.S. ban.</p><p>Juul, will however keep selling its mint, menthol and tobacco flavors. So far 33 people are known to have died in this country from vaping related lung disease.</p><p>The CDC says suicides by the way rose 56 percent among young adults and children over the last 10 years. In 2017, suicide was the second leading cause of deaths among people between the age of 10 and 24. In total, 47,000 Americans dying by suicide in 2017.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration setting an all-time record for generic drug approvals for fiscal year 2019. The agency approved more than a thousand generic drugs marking the third straight year of generic drug approvals under the Trump administration, three years of increases.</p><p>And joining us now Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Mr. Secretary, great to have you with us. Let's start with the generic drug approvals. I mean, that's a remarkable record. What is driving that?</p><p>ALEX AZAR, U.S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AHD HUMAN SERVICES: Well, it's incredible. It's President Trump's leadership. He told us, approve these generic drugs because competition lowers prices, and the President is adamant about getting drug prices down.</p><p>So we've had three years in a row under the President's leadership of historic levels of generic drug approvals, almost 3,000. That means in the first 18 months of the President's term alone, $26 billion of savings to healthcare, and that's going to be the gift that keeps on giving because that competition stays forever.</p><p>So he's just -- these changes are causing drug prices to go down. We've seen the biggest decrease in drug prices on the Inflation Index Measure in 51 years. The drug trend when the President took office is down 12 percent since the President took office in terms of where prices would have been.</p><p>DOBBS: And the President is adamant, he wants drug prices down. He wants prices for healthcare down. In talking about competition and efficiency, I don't know that we've had a President who has ever talked about introducing the idea of efficiency into healthcare and then achieving results, and certainly in the first term of office.</p><p>AZAR: I can assure you he was dogged in getting drug prices down. He wants list prices down. He wants what people pay out of pocket for their drugs down. He wants us to have better negotiations in our Federal programs where we're not getting good deals, and he wants to end foreign free riding. And he has commissioned me to get that done and it's delivering these results.</p><p>DOBBS: Foreign free riding. What do you mean by that?</p><p>AZAR: The United States overpays for its drugs and our Western high economy competitors underpay for their drugs. Right now, the United States senior citizen is paying for a key class of drugs, these intravenous drugs like for oncology or MS or rheumatoid arthritis, we're paying almost twice what the average Western developed democracy pays.</p><p>We are subsidizing socialism. In other countries, they are getting a free ride off of us because we're being chumps and overpaying.</p><p>DOBBS: Another example of this President talking about the United States operating as a pansy for the rest of the world.</p><p>AZAR: Exactly. When has a President stood up for American seniors like that? To say we're going to stop overpaying and we're going to make the others pay a fair share.</p><p>DOBBS: And at this point, this is going to be obviously a central point of the campaign of 2020 because it affects every citizen of this country: Healthcare.</p><p>And the Democrats, obviously are moving towards socialism in all aspects by talking about socialized medicine without reservation, Medicare-for-All, they style it. Your thoughts?</p><p>AZAR: Medicare-for-All would be Medicare for none. It is really interesting. The same people who presented this utopian vision of Obamacare that it was going to solve all the world's problems, get rid of the uninsured, and everything else, they now admit that Obamacare failed to deliver.</p><p>So what have they done, instead of coming to markets and putting the patient at the center? Yet again, a utopian one-size-fits-all vision for the American people of a bureaucratic government takeover of healthcare. And what it's going to do is it's going to undermine Medicare for our seniors.</p><p>And what President Trump just a couple of weeks ago said in an Executive Order is, he will be the bulwark. He will defend America's seniors, their Medicare. He will protect it. He will protect what works. He will make it better and he is going to fix what's broken in our system.</p><p>DOBBS: There is so much that is broken, particularly when it comes to drugs and no, to me, a more tragic example than the opioid crisis that we see hopefully being resolved here now, but the number of opiate death overdose is extraordinary. Where are we in getting that under control and trying to restore broken lives?</p><p>AZAR: Well, you know, thanks to President Trump's leadership, it's a whole government approach and across every single metric, we're winning the battle. We've got a long way to go because it took a while to get into this crisis.</p><p>But for the first time in decades, we've seen drug overdose deaths actually decline by five percent. Since the President took office, we've reduced opioid prescribing by 31 percent. We have the opioid overdose reversing drug, a 378 percent increase in prescribing and distribution of that product.</p><p>So we're making huge progress and we're getting people in medication- assisted treatment, which is the gold standard for bringing people out of addiction, putting them into work and getting them treated and putting them into long-term recovery that way -- 1.27 million Americans are benefiting from the President's bipartisan leadership there.</p><p>DOBBS: So much that is exciting that's happening in healthcare, whether it be immune therapy, targeted therapies that are being developed. The deregulation, if you will, to provide drugs to people at a faster rate than ever before. And deregulation, the effect of those efforts is already showing up. Your thoughts as we conclude here.</p><p>AZAR: Well, it is showing results. At HHS, my department, we're one-third of the U.S. government in terms of budget spending. We've delivered last year, $12.6 billion of regulatory savings. That's burden that's relieved on the private sector. This year, it'll be already over $10 billion.</p><p>We have cut bureaucracy that has freed up 40 million hours of doctors' time in America to be with patients.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>AZAR: By getting rid of red tape.</p><p>DOBBS: Forty million. I mean, and we're facing a doctor shortage. So this is a timely win.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, great talking with you and great work if I may say.</p><p>AZAR: Thank you very much.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you so much for all you're doing for the country. We appreciate it. We'll be right back. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A group of business executives and billionaire donors want Florida's Governor, Ron deSantis to back off his immigration crackdown. The billionaires are lobbying the Governor, lobbying against statewide mandatory e-verify that is to assure that workers are in the country legally and for drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants.</p><p>The effort is led by Mike Fernandez, a longtime Jeb Bush donor who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Bob Dickinson, he is a former CEO of Carnival Cruise Line who was accused of replacing American workers with foreign workers, not much came of that and he is still trying.</p><p>Senator Mike Lee -- speaking of trying -- is spending his time defending his proposed bill, Senate Bill 386. It is simply an assault on working Americans, the American middle class and by the way, an insult against all Americans because it is duplicitous and deceitful.</p><p>The Senate bill is known as -- be ready for this -- the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act. He wrote in a statement Wednesday, quote, \"What it does do is end the discriminatory current policy that punishes Green Card applicants from large countries,\" read China and India.</p><p>But that is exactly the problem. It would allow countries like India and China to push through as many H1B visa workers as they like who will then take U.S. jobs at lower pay for an indefinite period, by the way, because they get to automatically stay in the country while they wait for an employer-sponsored application for a Green Card.</p><p>And in the 2020 election cycle, here is Senator Lee. He is of course a fan of foreign labor, but not so much American labor. He has raked in thousands from some of the top sponsors of H1B visas -- Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, -- you know, the usual list.</p><p>And joining us tonight is Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. Jessica, good to have you with us. 386. Where do you stand on that piece of legislation that is apparently to right great wrongs that have been done to foreign workers in this country?</p><p>JESSICA VAUGHAN, DIRECTOR OF POLICY, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Oh, it's a terrible piece of legislation and it's very bad for American workers. The main reason it's so bad is because it rewards this business model for employers, and these Indian body shops to replace American workers with foreign workers who come in on visas, and promising them Green Cards, even though they're coming in on temporary work visas. It would put these visa workers at the head of the line to receive Green Cards even faster. And it means that --</p><p>DOBBS: But what is the -- I am sorry, Jessica, what is -- but what is the rationale? Why would you want to give 90 percent of the Green Cards to two countries? China? Because that would be the effect.</p><p>VAUGHAN: Right? That would be the result. Right. Because of the per country caps meter the issuance of Green Cards, so no one country can monopolize them.</p><p>But this legislation would say all of these contract workers from India who replaced American workers would go to the front of the line and that means employers who want to hire talent from the rest of the world would have to get behind them in line. It doesn't solve the backlog problem, because there are something like half a million of these visa workers who feel that they are entitled to get Green Cards, even though they came on a temporary visa.</p><p>And it rewards the employers, most of all. I mean, follow the money. That's why the big tech employers are funding this effort is because it allows them to perpetuate the system that has been so harmful for American workers, and costs so many Americans their livelihood, and it's bad for the country to displace this entire sector of tech workers.</p><p>DOBBS: I want to ask you, how is it that Mike Lee should be so interested in this backlog? It's a really -- it's one of the most specious pieces of reasoning I've seen by even swamp standards, to suggest that equity is based on a backlog rather than on the nation's needs.</p><p>And this will put back President Trump's meritocracy immigration regulation and law for years, if not decades. It may kill it.</p><p>VAUGHAN: That's right. Yes, it is a step away from the merit based system that we all know would be the best system for our country. Because most of these workers who came on the H1B visas are not particularly high skilled, they are ordinary workers --</p><p>DOBBS: I'm sorry. All these employers and the outsourcers I don't care whether you're talking about the Tata, you're talking about Cognizant, IBM, they tell you that these are the most skilled of all the immigrants in all the world and we've got to have them.</p><p>VAUGHAN: It's nonsense. They're ordinary workers doing jobs that Americans once did and they've been hired because they are cheaper.</p><p>DOBBS: For lower wage.</p><p>VAUGHAN: Right. Exactly. It's all about the paying lower wages and not having to bother with Americans when it bypass U.S. workers. That's how they did it. Follow the money.</p><p>You know, as for Senator Lee, you know, I can't speak to his motives, but he does have a lot of these high tech companies in his district and a lot of workers there and you know, it has been billed as fairness --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you know, Utah is a hotbed --</p><p>VAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: It's a hotbed of corporate labor arbitrage. I mean, it's preposterous and where is his legislation for the American worker? We took a cursory research run at it. And I will tell you, we found nothing.</p><p>He is interested in something quite different than the middle class and the American worker. It's just -- it's stunning to me. And I will never forget, you know, Bill Gates in a chair by himself before Senator Ted Kennedy talking about H1B visas, and how many do you need and he said, an infinite number.</p><p>That's what we basically have got isn't it? And the senator called me out for saying that it would double the H1B visas, the effect of that is precisely what I believe it still will do, pushing it to somewhere around 300 well, effectively 300,000. It's far more than that.</p><p>What is the estimate of H1B visa holders in this country right now? We're supposed to be giving out 65,000 a year.</p><p>VAUGHAN: Oh, it's not 65,000. It's about half a million. Each year, there are probably about 150,000. It's not a capped category because nonprofit organizations can get them in unlimited numbers and that means universities like the University of California under Janet Napolitano replaced all of their American IT workers with visa workers, and this will spread to other industries.</p><p>There's no doubt about that to accounting, nursing teaching, many other knowledge professions. Good jobs that Americans now have.</p><p>DOBBS: The hospital association in nursing -- a number of the Nurses Associations as I understand also oppose this Senate Bill 386.</p><p>VAUGHAN: With good reason. With good reason because -- and it perpetuates and rewards this business model of replacing American workers and --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, which we thought this President was well on the way to eliminating. And then Mike Lee and his own party, this has already moved out of the House, as you know. It is sitting in the Senate for -- it will be one of the most scurrilous acts, in my judgment, against the American worker, particularly under this President, it will not -- it will not be helpful to him in the 2020 election.</p><p>This is just -- it's horrific. Jessica, you get the last word.</p><p>VAUGHAN: Well, people are expecting the president to do something about this program. The answer is to get rid of the H1B program or drastically reform it so that it's impossible to replace American workers.</p><p>Senator Lee threw some other light reforms on it, but it's not enough to end this dysfunctional system and we need to move to a merit-based system.</p><p>DOBBS: The President is exactly right, as is his want. Jessica Vaughan, good to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>VAUGHAN: Good to talk to you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, billions of dollars helping China's rise across the globe. Some in Washington want to put an end to that. We'll talk with Congressman Anthony Gonzalez about his efforts to rein in the spending of U.S. tax dollars for China.</p><p>The World Bank is a fun place and we'll find out how much fun, when we continue. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A new report finds China tried to get loans from the World Bank to fund civilian surveillance in a province holding more than a million Muslim minorities in retraining camps.</p><p>Document showed China's recipients tried to secure tens of thousands of dollars to buy facial recognition and night vision cameras along with other surveillance technology funded by the World Bank.</p><p>The World Bank says those funds were not disbursed, which you'll be pleased to know if we can count on that.</p><p>Our next guest tonight has introduced legislation to stop World Bank lending to China, at least curb it. Joining us tonight is Congressman Anthony Gonzalez. He is a member of the Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Congressman, great to have you with us? Let's start with why in the world is the World Bank sending our taxpayer money to China? Don't we send them enough? Don't they take enough?</p><p>REP. ANTHONY GONZALEZ (R-OH): They take enough is the right way to frame it. So you're a hundred percent right. There's no good reason why the United States taxpayer should be backing loans to the Chinese government for prison camps in Xinjiang or for anything, frankly.</p><p>But the reason why is because China has infiltrated the World Bank and influenced the World Bank to such a degree that they have severely curbed our influence and theirs has accelerated. They basically bought off the African countries, is my understanding and they also have quite a few allies in Europe. And that's directly at our expense.</p><p>And so it's crazy. Anybody who you paint this picture to comes to the same agreement if you're an American, and so I've introduced legislation that will encourage them to do just that, to graduate from the program, never take loans backed by U.S. taxpayers ever again from the World Bank and start to hold them accountable.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, good for you. Great for you. And shame on us. I mean, we created the World Bank. We created the International Monetary Fund. And then we act like we are disinterested passive investors. When in point of fact, our attention has never been more required, but what more can we do?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Well, I think we've done a lot.</p><p>DOBBS: David Malpass is American.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Every World Bank President is an American.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, he was -- he's always been a hawk on China. What happened?</p><p>GONZALEZ: And he is. So David Malpass is doing a very good job of taming that down. The previous President, Jim Kim was horrific. So China doubled their loan capacity under him. You can look up speeches of the former President touting the Belt and Road Initiative as a positive development for China. And that was under the Obama administration.</p><p>When Malpass came in, you start to see the loan program diminish. I want it to go to zero, frankly. I just don't think we should have any dollars there. But he is working hard and his team is. I commend him for that work. But we need to continue to push on this because it's not just going to happen unless we do it.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I want to turn if I may to, to the Articles of Impeachment that are being marked up right now at the House Judiciary Committee. What is your take on why we're even going through this process? Surely, surely, Nancy Pelosi, even Adam Schiff, understand that their farce has exposed them for the louts they are. It's just despicable that they even proceed with this.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Yes, I mean, I can tell you back in Northeast Ohio, in my district, this is very unpopular to be going down this impeachment path. You will be hard pressed to find constituents of mine who are excited about the impeachment passed.</p><p>And so I'm against it for a whole host of reasons. On principle, I'm against it, but also as I can tell you, in a very important swing district or a very important swing state, the people of Ohio are not for this at all, and I'm with them.</p><p>DOBBS: And those are good folks to be with, Congressman. I am with the rest of the country, too, because most of the country is absolutely adamantly opposed to these Articles of Impeachment and carrying out this affront against the President and in fact, everybody who voted for him. It's just unconscionable.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Yes, especially so close to the next election. I mean, I'm somebody who believes that whenever you get the opportunity, you put the faith in the American people and you let them decide. That's how self- government works. This close to an election, I think there are a lot of voters, even voters who don't like the President, frankly, who are looking at this and going okay, this feels like a completely partisan exercise and we're about to revolt.</p><p>Let the American people decide who the President of the United States is. We're 11 months away.</p><p>DOBBS: And yes, and also trying to overthrow a President who is historic in his achievement, his accomplishments and success for the very people of Ohio and every other state in the union. Congressman Anthony Gonzales, thanks for being with us. Come back soon.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>DOBBS: We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The radical Dems attempted overthrow of the Trump presidency started as an effort to first disrupt his campaign, and then to block his path to the White House.</p><p>So I've got a few thoughts about all of this, and remind you that once elected, the Dems and the Deep State, together combined to overthrow President Trump.</p><p>Perversely, we know all of this because of the investigations that were launched by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department in their efforts to subvert President Trump and his agenda. And the investigations by the D.O.J. Inspector General, his hard work to find out about the -- well, what was going on with those initial investigations, and of course, the dogged determination of Attorney General Barr to investigate the investigators and to begin to hold accountable those who corrupted our government, particularly our F.B.I. and Department of Justice.</p><p>Even as we watch the hapless Dems now in the House Judiciary, trying to construct two hollow and meaningless so-called Articles of Impeachment and move them on to the floor of the House, they appear unaware that they've reached well beyond their grasp of the consequences and are now performing before an alert American public.</p><p>And after three years of their venomous attacks on President Trump, their broader purpose is all too clear.</p><p>The F.B.I.'s Crossfire Hurricane operation, the Special Counsel investigation, the desperately contrived pretext of an Impeachment Inquiry based on one phone call. And now the vapid conclusion to what has been a three-month long farce. All of it is now clear, and all of it was designed to overthrow the President.</p><p>If that failed, then to block the President's agenda and at the very least, to intimidate President Trump and his party. The Dems thought the least they could expect from their corrupt scheme was a President who would do their bidding, abandon his wall on the border, be forced to accept illegal immigration, more deadly drugs across our southern border, sign on to any trade agreement that Wall Street and the business roundtable demanded. They were wrong misjudging this president and misjudging the tens of millions of Americans who have stood with him throughout.</p><p>In a truly unexpected development, the unity of Republicans standing with President Trump and preserving his presidency and our republic. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Our next guest has a new book out already, higher on the Amazon bestseller list than the so-called anonymous book. Joining us tonight, a man not anonymous, Doug Wead, adviser to two Presidents, presidential historian, author of the new bestseller, \"Inside Trump's White House.\" It's out today and Doug, congratulations on the book.</p><p>We want to tell you we recommend it to you highly, and how much fun was this to write?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR: It was so much fun. You better than anybody would know, it's fun for me to even tell you, but when they finally approved it, and I walk in the Oval Office, he doesn't even say hello, he doesn't shake my hand. I walk in the Oval Office, and he's got these papers and says, this is my private correspondence with Kim Jong- un.</p><p>They don't want you to have this. They tell me not to let you see this, but I'm going to let you have it. You can't copy it. You can't keep it, but you can read it. And that's how it started.</p><p>DOBBS: That's great. That is wonderful. And very Trumpian, we can say. The origins of the -- first, his motivation to be President. Your thoughts about that? And what you reveal in the book?</p><p>WEAD: You know, this was fascinating for me. At one point, we went around and around and I got all the kids to tell me their versions and they were nothing like Bill O'Reilly says it happened to the White House Correspondents' Dinner that none of that it happened. Way before that as you know.</p><p>DOBBS: Take that O'Reilly, you're already under the bus there.</p><p>WEAD: As you know, because you know him. But he finally at one point, we were talking about business. He said, you know, you buy a business that's poorly run, and then you sell it after you've made it better. You never buy a business that's well run, because you'll lose money.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes.</p><p>WEAD: He said, I ran for president after two terrible Presidents. So he is thinking Bush and Obama, I'm going to follow them, it's time to run.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, he had a great point, because those were two of the worst Presidents, I believe in this country's history, both bumbling. And I know you served one of them, and I don't mean to offend anyone. But the truth is, this country was in terrible shape when the President was elected.</p><p>I don't think there are many men or women, I don't think anyone could have done a better job than he has stepping in and doing all that he could against all odds. Your thoughts?</p><p>WEAD: Yes, it's remarkable. I think he's a great President. You measure Presidents based on the economy, on how they handle war and peace, on their intelligence, on their communication skills and there's 120 others.</p><p>When it comes to communication, he is transformational with digital media. When it comes to intelligence, he could see what the greatest economists in the world couldn't see. They were unanimous, and he was right and they were wrong.</p><p>DOBBS: How do you feel about this? Because one of the things that irritates the dickens out of me is to talk about whether he is giving Jerome Powell a deserved tongue lashing because he doesn't have a sense of markets and he raises interest rates.</p><p>And people said, well, you know, he had good instincts, as if it was instinctual. No. The man has great judgment. He has great intellect. It's stunning to see the people who do not want to acknowledge the innate capacity of the man, his intelligence, and his judgment.</p><p>WEAD: And war and peace. That's what a historian looks for.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>WEAD: It's been 40 years since we've had a President who hasn't started a war -- 40 years. There may be granata or an invasion here like Libya or Bosnia, but they all invaded somebody, not him. And peace and prosperity is the ideal historically for a President.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. And to bring home troops as he says he will and as he has, it is a difficult challenge in these times. Your access to the President, how much did you have? In what form?</p><p>WEAD: Well, he allowed me to interview anybody I wanted.</p><p>DOBBS: That's pretty good access.</p><p>WEAD: So I started -- it was pretty good. All the Cabinet -- the hostages, I interviewed the hostages and -- but I started with the family and I couldn't get out of the family. They are so interesting. Jared, nobody really had interviewed Jared extensively. I did.</p><p>I've got 600 pages, Lou of transcripts of interviews with the family that are just utterly fascinating.</p><p>DOBBS: That's great.</p><p>WEAD: And he, the night of the election, he thought he was going to lose early. And they said, what are you going to do? He said, I'm going to go down the stairs, go down on Fifth Avenue, I'm going to say I did my best. I'm a patriot. And then tomorrow, I'm going to get on a plane and go to Ireland and play golf.</p><p>And then a few hours later, they returned. They said, you're going to win. You're going to win. And Ivanka was trying to get him away from the TV. He was in the kitchen and he was watching the Clinton -- young ladies crying because Clinton was losing.</p><p>He was saying, look at this and imagine how they feel. He was very empathetic for these people. It's very unusual. The story is different than I expected.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, and we recommend such stories to you in this terrific bestseller by Doug Wead, \"Inside Trump's White House.\" Fully transparent, giving you great access and we are delighted you wrote the book.</p><p>WEAD: And he loves you. I guess, you know that.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you know, it's -- you know, he and I are -- we get along pretty good.</p><p>WEAD: You do. You do.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much, Doug. Appreciate you being with us tonight. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020123101cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW8-6C11-DXH2-6339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7164\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Healthcare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Bank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Case in point: Wozniak said Goldman Sachs, the financial services giant that teamed up with Apple to offer the banking-type services and infrastructure associated with the card, gave Wozniak a 10x Apple Card credit line compared to the one extended to his wife. That's despite the fact that the couple shares various bank and credit card accounts and that other lenders more or less treat them the same for credit purposes. </p><p>Woz acknowledged the disparity in a Twitter reply to Ruby on Rails co-creatorDavid Heinemeier Hansson, who on Friday took to Twitter to allege the same thing happening to him: The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019. \u2014 Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) November 10, 2019[1] Those tweets have, perhaps understandably, not only kicked up a firestorm. But in a statement provided to Bloomberg[2], a spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services made it clear the department has decided to open an investigation because of this. It would seem to be an investigation into Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, and the statement reads: 'The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex.' The spokesman continued: 'Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.' In Hansson's case, he was able to talk to Apple representatives, and it seems his wife's credit line was ultimately bumped up to be equal to his. Still, he continued railing about the experience on Twitter: She spoke to two Apple reps. Both very nice, courteous people representing an utterly broken and reprehensible system. The first person was like 'I don't know why, but I swear we're not discriminating, IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM'. I shit you not. 'IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM!'. \u2014 DHH (@dhh) November 8, 2019[3] 'Let's recap here,' Hansson continued in a long Twitter thread. 'Apple offers a credit card that bases its credit assessment on a black-box algorithm that 6 different reps across Apple and (Goldman Sachs) have no visibility into. Even several layers of management. An internal investigation. IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM! 'So nobody understands THE ALGORITHM. Nobody has the power to examine or check THE ALGORITHM. Yet everyone we've talked to from both Apple and GS are SO SURE that THE ALGORITHM isn't biased and discriminating in any way. That's some grade-A management of cognitive dissonance.' Interestingly, this is the second investigation of this kind the New York regulator opened in recent weeks, following another into claims that a UnitedHealth Group Inc. algorithm was biased in favor of white patients over black patients. Apple Card, meanwhile, launched in August as the iPhone maker's first entry into the world of consumer finance and building on the company's existing mobile payment system Apple Pay. Goldman Sachs backs Apple Card, which can be used digitally within Apple Pay as well as in a physical card form. In comments last month, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon called the introduction of the card 'the most successful credit-card launch ever,' with his company having extended some $10 billion in credit to Apple Card users as of September 30[4].

That's despite the fact that the couple shares various bank and credit card accounts and that other lenders more or less treat them the same for credit purposes.Woz acknowledged the disparity in a Twitter reply to Ruby on Rails co-creator\u00a0David Heinemeier Hansson, who on Friday took to Twitter to allege the same thing happening to him:The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.- Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193330241478901760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2019</url></p><p>Those tweets have, perhaps understandably, not only kicked up a firestorm. But in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs\">a statement provided to Bloomberg</url>, a spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services made it clear the department has decided to open an investigation because of this. It would seem to be an investigation into Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, and the statement reads: \"The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex.\"</p><p>The spokesman continued: \"Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.\"</p><p>In Hansson's case, he was able to talk to Apple representatives, and it seems his wife's credit line was ultimately bumped up to be equal to his. Still, he continued railing about the experience on Twitter:</p><p>She spoke to two Apple reps. Both very nice, courteous people representing an utterly broken and reprehensible system. The first person was like \"I don't know why, but I swear we're not discriminating, IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM\". I shit you not. \"IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM!\".</p><p>- DHH (@dhh) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192945019230945280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 8, 2019</url></p><p>\"Let's recap here,\" Hansson continued in a long Twitter thread. \"Apple offers a credit card that bases its credit assessment on a black-box algorithm that 6 different reps across Apple and (Goldman Sachs) have no visibility into. Even several layers of management. An internal investigation. IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM!</p><p>\"So nobody understands THE ALGORITHM. Nobody has the power to examine or check THE ALGORITHM. Yet everyone we've talked to from both Apple and GS are SO SURE that THE ALGORITHM isn't biased and discriminating in any way. That's some grade-A management of cognitive dissonance.\"</p><p>Interestingly, this is the second investigation of this kind the New York regulator opened in recent weeks, following another into claims that a UnitedHealth Group Inc. algorithm was biased in favor of white patients over black patients.</p><p>Apple Card, meanwhile, launched in August as the iPhone maker's first entry into the world of consumer finance and building on the company's existing mobile payment system Apple Pay. Goldman Sachs backs Apple Card, which can be used digitally within Apple Pay as well as in a physical card form. In comments last month, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon called the introduction of the card \"the most successful credit-card launch ever,\" with his company having extended some $10 billion in credit to Apple Card users <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-users-received-10-billion-from-goldman-sachs-2019-11\">as of September 30</url>.</p><p>More from BGR</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/10/15/apple-card-most-successful-ever-goldman-sachs-ceo/\">Apple credit card partner calls Apple Card the 'most successful' launch ever</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/08/23/apple-card-leather-denim-stain-omg-stfu/\">Please, for the love of God, shut up about the Apple Card getting ruined by leather and denim</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/08/20/apple-card-release-date-credit-card-available-to-all-us-iphone-owners/\">Apple Card is available beginning right now for all iPhone users in the US</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRBGR-5757844</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRBGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGC-6F51-DYJW-X0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434845</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26323\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Europe, which depends on America's intelligence reach to fend off terrorists, has embarked on a path that will sabotage some of our most important intelligence capabilities. This crisis has been a long time brewing, and up to now, the US has responded with a patchwork of stopgap half-solutions. </p><p>That's not likely to work this time. We need a new strategy. And most of all, we need to get serious about defending U.S. interests. It's no surprise that the US fight against terrorism depends crucially on the so-called 702 program, which allows the government to serve orders on social media, webmail, and electronic service providers who store their global customers' data in the United States. The intelligence we gather in this way protects Europe as much as the United States. Within days of the Paris attacks, the US agreed to give France direct access to much raw intelligence[1]. Even more recently, the German government credited US (and French) intelligence with helping it thwart[2] planned suicide bombings in Munich over the New Year holiday. The British communications intelligence agency, GCHQ, has a deeply integrated intelligence sharing arrangement with NSA[3]. None of these countries, let alone the smaller members of the European Union, can hope to match the American intelligence resources that are now marshaled in their defense. So it might seem odd that the European Union poses a threat to these capabilities. Odd but true. The problem has deep roots in Europe's dysfunctional governance structure and in the mix of dependence and resentment that shape its relationship to the United States. In the name of protecting privacy, the EU has long insisted that personal data may not be exported to other countries unless those countries provide 'adequate' legal guarantees for privacy[4], and it has frequently threatened to cut off data flows to the United States because of differences in US and EU data protection law. The threats were grounded partly in economic interest - keeping data processing jobs and companies in Europe - and partly in a European enthusiasm for expressing its moral superiority to the United States. The EU and US have always been able to negotiate a solution as these crises have been created, but the dynamic changed this fall when the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to rule on the adequacy of US privacy law. Relying in part on irresponsible and inaccurate statements by the European Commission, the ECJ declared that the Commission had not justified a conclusion that United States surveillance oversight is 'adequate[5].' It overturned the 'Safe Harbor' that had allowed US companies to send customer data across the Atlantic. Just as important, it authorized individual data protection agencies in each member state to adjudicate the lawfulness of data transfers to the United States. While the decisions of those agencies can be appealed, the EU has reached agreement on penalties for data protection violations[6] that are a percentage of companies' global revenue - billions of dollars in the case of big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. With those penalties hanging over their head, few companies will want to gamble that they'll be vindicated on appeal. The data protection agencies, meanwhile, are delighted to have the US and its tech companies in their sights; they've said that enforcement actions are likely to begin at the end of January.[7] The European Commission has been trying to reach a new agreement with the United States to reinstate the Safe Harbor;[8] the US has provided assurances that our intelligence oversight meets European standards. (Indeed, it far exceeds anything that French or German or British intelligence agencies put up with.) But the Commission's authority to bind the data protection authorities is in doubt, and it is increasingly under the thumb of a reflexively anti-American European Parliament, which will be inclined to reject or cavil at whatever it negotiates. As a result, the Commission has dug in its heels, demanding wide access to (and implicit authority over) US intelligence programs. There's a high probability that no deal, or at least no good deal, can be reached with the Commission. Weirdly, the European institutions that have created this mess have no serious responsibility for stopping terrorism or for collecting and using intelligence. The European security agencies that have that responsibility are powerful in individual countries but have little sway in Brussels. This means that the machinery set in motion by the European Court of Justice will grind forward, with everyone doing what they've done before: The Commission will seek maximum concessions from US intelligence agencies. The European Parliament will deem the concessions insufficient. The data protection agencies will do all they can to punish American tech companies. Without a deal, tech companies may have to move their data centers out of the United States - making counterterrorism intelligence unavailable to our government. And they will be under heavy pressure to break with the US government on intelligence issues - to encrypt even more data to foil US intercepts, and to fight US intelligence orders in court and in Congress. US intelligence will suffer, perhaps greatly, and European and Americans will be at greater risk of terrorist attacks. In short, if all the players in this drama just keep doing what they've always done, the result will be a disaster for US (and European) counterterrorism efforts. If we want to stave off that disaster, we have to shake up the peculiar European structures that are driving this outcome. We have to make clear that continued attempts to hold American companies hostage over intelligence collection is simply unacceptable to the United States. Up to now, the Administration has tried to appease Europe; it has not played hard ball. And Congress has been disappointingly inactive, except for the House of Representatives, which has gone from inactive to supine in a related dispute, proposing to amend US law to give greater privacy rights to Europeans without demanding even before the negotiations are complete[9]. What could the US do to change Europe's negotiating calculus? It's not that hard, if we have the will. Congress (or, frankly, the President) could simply prohibit the sharing of intelligence with any country whose data protection agencies take action that has the effect of undermining US intelligence capabilities; this would certainly include punishing private companies that send data to the United States. Such a measure would make clear the connection between European data protectionism and our lost counterterrorism insights. While it is harsh to cut off intelligence to countries that are often allies against terrorism, the fact is that their policies will slowly cut off US access to terrorism intelligence. (We don't have to cut off access across the board; the measure could allow exceptions when the President certifies the need to share particular intelligence, but broad intelligence sharing would be barred with any country that takes action against US data access.) Such a measure has the advantage of putting the onus of solving the problem on individual member states - the entities responsible for national security and for the actions of the data protection agencies. (It's notable that data protection authorities have rarely or never tried to regulate their own national intelligence agencies; they don't have the clout. Which strongly suggests that those agencies can bring the data protectors to heel if their access to US intelligence depends on it.) Negotiations with individual European nations, then, are far more likely to produce responsible results than negotiations with the neutered European Commission. That's one way of making clear to Europe that we've had enough. Here's another. The US and Europe have been negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for years, and it's likely that a deal will be presented to Congress for approval in 2016. This is part of the Obama administration's ambitious effort to lock in a host of environmental, intellectual property, labor and trade policies via large multinational deals. You'd think that any effort to restrict protectionism and foster trade would address Europe's data export restraints - probably the biggest trade issue between the US and the EU in the last fifteen years. You'd be wrong. Both the European Commission and the European Parliament have taken data protectionism off the table in this trade deal, insisting that their current rules must be untouched. The result is a trade deal that as a practical matter blesses the current EU attack on our counterterrorism intelligence programs. Unlike the European Parliament, Congress has said nothing about the issue, strengthening the European hand. Yet it is Europe that likely needs a trade deal far more than the US. Europe's economy has lagged ours in growth and employment for decades, with the one economic bright spot being a consistently large trade surplus with the US. Congress should take a page from the European Parliament's book, adopting a resolution stating that no transatlantic trade deal will be approved if it permits the EU's current interference with both US technology trade and US counterterrorism capabilities. There will be opposition to either of these measures. Many American businesses expect to get specific benefits from a trade deal, and they are reluctant to upset the apple cart. Refusing to share terror intelligence, meanwhile, has a cold-hearted air. But if we fail to deal with Europe's data protectionism in this trade deal, we may never have another chance; that will be bad for US industry, which will increasingly be held hostage or forced to accept uneconomic restrictions on how they manage their data. And cutting off counterterrorism intelligence sharing with countries that are undermining the foundation on which that intelligence rests is simply a matter of self-preservation. If Europe wants to cripple its intelligence agencies, it is free to make that choice. We should not let it cripple ours. &lt;nl/&gt; <url

Smith: Your GBS Training System column was the best online trading advice I've read. Period.\u00a0</p><p>I'm a retired musician, and unfortunately, not a math whiz, so when I tackle projects like writing spreadsheets, writing/running backtests, keeping paper-trading portfolios for bottom-fishing/shorting data, keeping a trading diary, etc....it's out of the greatest reluctance that I begin these daunting chores, let alone maintain them\u2026\u00a0</p><p> But you're darn right......the \"zen\" is bunk, and I *intuitively* KNEW that....I just never wanted to admit it to myself, because......hey......If I could just guess \"up\" or \"down\" right, and get \"in sync\" with the psychology, and be a \"contrarian\" trader, and blah, blah, blah.....BALONEY!!!\u00a0</p><p>I've been at this for longer than I care to admit, and your article really has me soul searching...\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I really hope you'll concentrate on this theme Gary, and develop the idea with guys like me in mind........even if it's nothing more than a step by step glimpse of how you came by the conclusion to \"buy at market\" at the open, instead of gap-open techniques with limit orders\u2026 (Did you keep records of the actual fill, vs a paper trade fill and backtest it?) And do you trade on days that open down like today ? with trend or against ?\u00a0</p><p>You know, the works ! All the details.....not necessarily to copy, but to inspire innovation.\u00a0</p><p>I don't know *anyone* else that's doing this; to the contrary, most \"trading\" sights are strictly \"wing and a prayer\" outfits, where the \"main guy\" makes a trade recommendation, and all the unfortunates within his earshot, bid up his _already-filled_ order, getting at least ONE person out with a profit. (I wish I had a nickel for every one of these I've seen.....GAH!)\u00a0</p><p>Your column is terrific, and I hope you have the editorial freedom to go so far as to suggest that we collectively get off our bums, fire the newsletter/website/cnbc/aol gurus, start converting our mistakes to data that we can learn from, like you seem to have done.\u00a0</p><p>-- Dick London (received 6/11/98) The Intel Probe\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: First, let me say that I strongly agree with you regarding the undue influence of lawyers, and other non-productive varmints, especially as it relates to distractions for companies like Intel.  Second, I agree that Intel is a great company, and they have made me a lot of money through the years, and I love their products and the speed with which they evolve.\u00a0</p><p>However, I must respectfully disagree with you that there is absolutely no anti-trust issue with respect to Intel. Sadly, they have been guilty of some tactics similar to those of MSFT in recent times since they have controlled the PC hardware.  For example, they were requiring that if a PC vendor wanted to have early system design info for each new generation of microprocessor chip, they had to use Intel motherboards (not ONLY microprocessors) in their first generation machines.  Now, if there had been a reasonable alternative source of microprocessors, this might have been reasonable, but, of course, they had a functional monopoly.  In an industry that moves as fast as the PC business, this of course meant that ALL first versions of a particular generation were on Intel motherboards, thereby precluding innovation by the PC vendor themselves.  Or, if a vendor tried to go it alone, they would not be able to have a competitive product available during the critical first months of a new generation, which would have been tantamount to commercial suicide.\u00a0</p><p>There are other examples, as well--things such as Intel customers suddenly suffering parts shortages should they agree to use chips from an Intel competitor.\u00a0</p><p>Having said all this, I actually feel that this current investigation is probably good for INTC.  At the very least,it will cause them to reassess their business practices, and (if they are still doing this sort of stuff) change in ways that are better for us, their customers.  Given that Messrs. Barrett et al. are much less likely to take the arrogant approach of Mr. Softee, I would not be surprised to see a reasonable settlement that will be an obvious winner for everyone.\u00a0</p><p> -- Dave Kisker (received 6/11/98) Leave the Crash Helmet\u00a0</p><p>The waves of \"impending crash\" caveats that accompany just about every discussion of the U.S. stockmarket caused me to recall a sage's advice that, \"the market always does what the fewest people expect\".  Well, there are certainly many people who expect a crash, but there are also a lot of people who believe the market is headed much higher.  Is there another scenario that might be developing?  I believe so.\u00a0</p><p>First, lets think about the economic background that investors face.  The Asian economies have yet to find a bottom.  Several of our telecom equipment analysts have indicated that the companies they follow should report in line second quarter results, but that companies that distribute to Asia (the manufacturer's customers) are experiencing large increases in inventory. Result: channel stuffing will enable many companies to hit June quarter forecasts, but second half forecasts will come down.  If this is true, it explains why it seems that there have been a manageable number of pre-releases this quarter.  Nonetheless, the conference calls may be a different matter.  Conclusion: Domestic U.S. economic growth is unlikely to accelerate and should begin to slow as the year progresses.  If so, inflation will be very low and with it, bond yields will decline.\u00a0</p><p>If the market does what the fewest expect, what could this scenario mean for investors?\u00a0</p><p>1. Continued high valuations (P/E, Price/Book, etc.).  This will drive the valuation crowd crazy.  Investors will scramble for anything with growth among a diminishing list of growth companies.  This view helps explain the high valuations of internet stocks --- at least they have growth.\u00a0</p><p>2. Volatile individual stock prices.  These high valuations will cause companies that disappoint to be slaughtered because confidence in future growth will be shaken (and investors will move quickly to the next hot growth story).\u00a0</p><p>3.  Slowing growth, high valuations and periodic blowups will depress the typical investor's annual returns into the mid-single digits.  Few individuals or money managers will be able to sprint through an investment landscape increasingly littered with landmines.\u00a0</p><p>4. Low bond yields will cause total returns from fixed income instruments to be less than 6%.  Although the long bond might have a bit of price upside as yields drift toward 5%, total returns elsewhere along the yield curve won't provide double digit returns.\u00a0</p><p>Bottom line: Investors may get neither mid-teens returns nor a crash that enables them to buy on the dip.  Instead, we may be headed for a several quarter period of sluggish performance as valuations gradually come back to more normal levels.  As a old consumer goods analyst, this is exactly how large cap consumer stocks behave --- a few to several years of outstanding performance, followed not by a crash, but by flat line price performance as valuations catch up (take a look at KO in the late 1980's/early 1990's, or WMT more recently).\u00a0</p><p> -- Richard Davis Jr. (received 6/11/98) Hayden's an Asset\u00a0</p><p>An asset allocator is a welcome addition to TheStreet.com. I'd like to see a debate between Cramer and Vern Hayden on whether asset allocation maximizes returns or guarantees mediocrity.\u00a0</p><p>-- Roger Mann (received 6/10/98) Rewarded\u00a0</p><p>The only people who have been rewarded by the R.S. Contrarian Fund are those of us who were smart enough to get out last October when it was first nominated for the fund graveyard. Thanks TSC. Paul Stephens doesn't have a clue!!!\u00a0</p><p> -- Jim Puffer (received 6/9/98) Y2K, Revisited\u00a0</p><p>The article on E*Trade and Y2K is very interesting, but not necessarily accurate.  Many non-legacy systems, built in the past couple of years, are still non-Y2K compliant.  I know first hand of one bank in the Northeast, which shall remain nameless, that contract to have a new system built to keep track of its trading.  They engage a consulting firm, which built the system totally with 2-digit dates.\u00a0</p><p>Webtrends 3.5, a program that I use to analyze my web site, is not Y2K compliant.  This is not only not a legacy system, it is very recent and totally Internet oriented\u00a0</p><p>This is not to say that E*Trade is not Y2K compliant, I'm simply pointing out that just because it is \"Internet\" and \"recent\" doesn't make it Y2K compliant.  Given the legacy systems it must interface with, they could very easily have Y2K issues.  The article doesn't mention any statements from the company about Y2K.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, the securities industry is far ahead of just about any other industry in terms of awareness and progress.  The initial SIA testing is scheduled for this July, and their testing methodology is available on the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeff Jacobs (received 6/9/98) Perplexed\u00a0</p><p>I am still perplexed by Jim Cramer's characterization of his stock positions as \"inventory\". As near as I can ascertain, Cramer has long term opinions about the unfolding relative improvement of certain large companies. He believes that on a short term basis the markets in those stocks reach technically diifficult to sustain short term levels of excess enthusiasm or revulsion. His trading, therefore, is broadly \"fading\" the public order flow.\u00a0</p><p>This is not, however, what I think of as securities \"inventory\", which is the raw material of a truly market-making function, or the by-product of the distribution of new issues.\u00a0</p><p>In my experience, one of the most dangerous situations a trader can find himself in is confusing speculation with a market-making discipline. It often leads to a two sets of books mentality where the interim losses are consigned to a mental investment account and the mental market-making account feels great.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Cramer's frenetic trading may be wonderfully cathartic for his hedge fund's senior partner; but one wonders at the end of the day, how much does it add to the performance of the firm's underlying, and presumably carefully formulated bets? Is it in large part grist for the insatiable moloch of Wall Street entertainment against a twice daily TheStreet deadline?\u00a0</p><p> -- Paul J. Isaac (received 6/8/98) The Ax\u00a0</p><p>Eric Moskowitz: Good series of articles on the various axes' on the Street. However, it is at times difficult to keep an eye out for comments from these analysts on a daily basis when the news agencies that report analysts upgrades/downgrades don't identify the analysts as \"axes\".  Therefore, how about you guys putting out a \"The Axe Has Spoken\" column as soon as one of these analysts makes a change in recommendation.\u00a0</p><p>-- Brett Rule (received 6/5/98) New Fan\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: Regarding the recent discussion in your column about comments directed at JJC, I offer my 2 cents. First, I began reading TSC because of JJC. I subscribed for a year (and will continue for long after that, I suppose) because of JJC. I try to read everything he writes, whether in TSC or other venues. I have learned more from him about trading than could be bought at any price at any of this country's best b-schools. I am obviously an ardent fan of his.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I am also becoming an ardent fan of yours since your arrival at TSC. Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like seeing the issues from \"both sides of the street.\" It allows one to keep a clearer head, and that is what the entire exercise of TSC should be about. The \"sniping\" is taken for what it is: the good-natured ribbing of JJC from one who also admires his work and personna, while making valid points in disagreement. As I've said to you before, keep up the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bill Luttrell (received 6/5/98) More Helpful\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: If you stop offering your perspective on the market, I'll cancel.  Although I respect JJC, and his views re trading etc. are interesting, your columns are much more helpful in my effort to understand this market as an investor.  So much noise and confusion out there!  What we need is wisdom and perspective on things. That's why I read your columns and that's why I'm still a subscriber to TSC.\u00a0</p><p>-- Tim Mikkel (received 6/5/98) Fore\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: When people hassle you about [a recent column on] Dell here is another analogy that my explain your bullishness.\u00a0</p><p>The four best golfers at a private club are Mr. Dell, Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP. They always shoot in the 70's with Mr. Dell usually shooting a couple of strokes better than the rest. There are lots of other members at the club but while being good players, they can't really compete with the big four. The club they belong to is know as an easy course(wide fairways, flat greens, few trees and sand traps). It is easy to score well. This course is the equivalent of the PC industry of the last couple of years, growth being so rapid everyone makes money.\u00a0</p><p>The big four decide to go on a golf vacation. By some miracle they are able to play Augusta National. Augusta National is the golf equivalent of today's PC environment \"HELL\". Needless to say Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP are completely overmatched by the course and shoot horrible scores. Mr. Dell sucks it up and scrambles his way to to another sub 80 round. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP put on a brave face and say they are going to head to the driving range to make a few adjustments in their game. Things will be better tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>The fundamental difference between Mr. Dell and the others(Mr IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP) is that Mr. Dell can adjust to the rapidly changing environment as the environment changes. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP get annihilated by a change in the environment, go back home reflect on what happened, develop a plan to adapt, put the plan into action and hope things will be better tomorrow. They will always be killed by a negative change in the environment(hard courses) and do well when the environment turns positive(easy courses).\u00a0</p><p>The morale of the story is that Mr Dell is a better golfer and if your going to bet on Golf then bet on Mr Dell. CREAMer always rises to the top.\u00a0</p><p> -- Mike Yaffe (received 6/5/98) Kudos\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: I don't understand people who don't \"get it\". I think the ongoing debate between the you [and James Cramer] is one of the things that make TSC an interesting forum. I, for one, am sick and tired of all the whiners who expect this to be a promtional site that has nothing but \"buys\" and positive spin. Tell them to put on their rose-coloured sunglasses and spend more time at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.justhypeme.com\">www.justhypeme.com</url> , otherwise known as Silicon Investor. As a paying customer, I would rather see fewer articles written for newbies - your sophistication and expertise is what adds value.\u00a0</p><p> -- A. John Carlesso (received 6/5/98) Remember the Akron\u00a0</p><p>Jim Cramer: Enjoy your writing, your comments have made money for me.  Thanks, and here is my favorite mental image of trading psychology.  Have you ever seen the newsreel clips of the 1920's US Airship Akron disaster? The scene is like traders' thinking about when to take the loss or hold on.  The airship was met by a party of about a hundred ground handlers grabbing the ropes when a sudden wind gust and loss of ballast control caused the ship to bob up and down twenty, thirty, forty feet three or four times before rapidly climbing to a thousand feet unable to descend and then crashing within the half hour. There was a rain of falling men from different heights.  When does the trader take his loss?  Like the ground handler he has to decide if he lets go for a 20 feet fall to suffer a broken leg or hold on for a litte longer until the ship gets back to only to only a 5 foot hop down. One could even hope to get back down uninjured.  But then what if the ship just continues up and up\u2026  This happened to the ones who didn't let go before it was too late. However, one man did survive by hanging even to a thousand feet holding on for dear life and walked away from the crash landing.\u00a0</p><p> -- Sanford Friedrich (received 6/5/98) Trust\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I welcomed the wisdom you shared yesterday, it helped put things in perspective and clearly you were right until the market got sand-bagged by the Intel whiff. You are on the money though, the trust level is down - I think that's what I was trying to articulate in my mail yesterday. Why should a trader trust a market that constantly deflates and then only partially re-inflates the next day? Clearly, for a newbie like me it's hard to see why one should - how many times do you need to get your hands burnt before you stop after all?\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps that's the most frightening thing about the market - the general feeling appears to be falling to short sentiment, which is something I haven't had much experience dealing with (I did send mail to Smith a few weeks ago to go over it since I suspected we would end up in this sort of market sometime - didn't think it would be this quick though). Here we now have people using the chats on the Net to try to move stocks down, not up - perhaps the strongest evidence I've felt that the nature of the game is changing. I sure hope I'm wrong, since this is a game that I really don't look forward to playing in.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bryan McCormick (received 6/5/98) What Intel Didn't Say\u00a0</p><p>With everything INTC has already said about business slacking off, coupled with another wave of price cuts, does Intel really need to issue another statement saying its profits/revenue/growth won't be what people thought?\u00a0</p><p> -- Erik Milstone (received 6/4/98) Turning the Tables\u00a0</p><p>Since Mr. Cramer has been on CNBC so much, I would like to see him turn the tables and invite Mark Haines to show up for Mr. Cramer's new show, Real Money.  Thanks for all the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Delosso (received 6/4/98) Instructive\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I read everything you publish on TS.com and the articles that are most instructive (to me) are the \"I Can Screw Up Too\" ones where you describe and analyze your mistakes.  I too evaluate my mistakes from every angle with the intention of learning how to avoid making the same mistake twice.  Please keep it up.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jerry Daughan, Harpswell, Maine (received 6/4/98) Stretched\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your arguments seem more stretched by the day.  For some reason you don't want to acknowledge that there is a huge slowdown at the semiconductor and boxmaker level.  Dell, GTW, may be good trades, but it's ludicrous to suggest that the fundamentals are improving.\u00a0</p><p> -- Steve Vita (received 6/4/98) No Reply\u00a0</p><p>Dan Colarusso: I have filed several e-mail type complaints with the NASDR office and the SEC enforcement-tips office over the past few months when I have seen \"blatant\" volume-spike options trading in calls or puts where there was no news, AND then after hours that company will come out with dramatic 'material' information which causes massive trading in the underlying stock the following morning-open.  Some of these instances are so damm obvious that (you or I) figure that the regulators should have been able to see it, also.  Most of the time, I never hear back from them.\u00a0</p><p> -- Gerald E. Naugle, Boulder, Colo. (received 6/4/98) Hear! Hear!\u00a0</p><p>As regards JJC's motion to start a \"conference cancellation watch\" on TSC, here's a second.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Scott (received 6/3/98) Terrific\u00a0</p><p>Gary Smith: Every time I read one of your columns I get ready to fire up the email to tell you how terrific I think your pieces are -- informative, motivating, and written with a style and dynamic (i.e., the way the words move you along) that remind me how excited I used to get when I got a sentence or paragraph right when I was writing a newsletter a number of years ago.

The Bottom\u00a0  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">James Cramer: In your recent column, you mentioned you have a way of spotting the bottom in a stock.  Since many of us are trying to identify the bottom in many of our favorite stocks, how about a column detailing your methodology.  You could frame it around some past experiences.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> -- Jonathan Daws (received 6/12/98) Eyes Peeled\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Thanks for your honest appraisal of Rowan and the oil services in general.  I am currently long NE and have been keeping me eyes peeled for comments from you on the subject.  I certainly value your opinion and this oil correction has been a real learing experience for me.  I am not a trader (obviously), but I also hate loosing money.  Your insight in this area has been quite helpful and look forward to your ongoing commentary.  No flames from me.\u00a0</p><p> -- Brian Fryar (received 6/12/98) Nicely Adjusted\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I think your columns this week have been nicely adjusted to state not only that value matters, but also to give specific company examples.\u00a0</p><p>Almost everyone at my office uses the \"it has gone down, now it must go up\" method and then they give themselves a pat on the back for doing so much research.\u00a0</p><p>If we have a long bear, they will all leave, muttering that the market is not to be trusted.

And in my case it was probably a much needed slap in the face. I'm a big tech fan (tech investing has been so good to me over the past two years), but as your column pointed out to me -- my trading lately has been based more on hope then on strategy and discipline.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction again.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jason Winfrey (received 6/11/98) Good Advice\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith: Your GBS Training System column was the best online trading advice I've read. Period.\u00a0</p><p>I'm a retired musician, and unfortunately, not a math whiz, so when I tackle projects like writing spreadsheets, writing/running backtests, keeping paper-trading portfolios for bottom-fishing/shorting data, keeping a trading diary, etc....it's out of the greatest reluctance that I begin these daunting chores, let alone maintain them\u2026\u00a0</p><p> But you're darn right......the \"zen\" is bunk, and I *intuitively* KNEW that....I just never wanted to admit it to myself, because......hey......If I could just guess \"up\" or \"down\" right, and get \"in sync\" with the psychology, and be a \"contrarian\" trader, and blah, blah, blah.....BALONEY!!!\u00a0</p><p>I've been at this for longer than I care to admit, and your article really has me soul searching...\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I really hope you'll concentrate on this theme Gary, and develop the idea with guys like me in mind........even if it's nothing more than a step by step glimpse of how you came by the conclusion to \"buy at market\" at the open, instead of gap-open techniques with limit orders\u2026 (Did you keep records of the actual fill, vs a paper trade fill and backtest it?) And do you trade on days that open down like today ? with trend or against ?\u00a0</p><p>You know, the works ! All the details.....not necessarily to copy, but to inspire innovation.\u00a0</p><p>I don't know *anyone* else that's doing this; to the contrary, most \"trading\" sights are strictly \"wing and a prayer\" outfits, where the \"main guy\" makes a trade recommendation, and all the unfortunates within his earshot, bid up his _already-filled_ order, getting at least ONE person out with a profit. (I wish I had a nickel for every one of these I've seen.....GAH!)\u00a0</p><p>Your column is terrific, and I hope you have the editorial freedom to go so far as to suggest that we collectively get off our bums, fire the newsletter/website/cnbc/aol gurus, start converting our mistakes to data that we can learn from, like you seem to have done.\u00a0</p><p>-- Dick London (received 6/11/98) The Intel Probe\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: First, let me say that I strongly agree with you regarding the undue influence of lawyers, and other non-productive varmints, especially as it relates to distractions for companies like Intel.  Second, I agree that Intel is a great company, and they have made me a lot of money through the years, and I love their products and the speed with which they evolve.\u00a0</p><p>However, I must respectfully disagree with you that there is absolutely no anti-trust issue with respect to Intel. Sadly, they have been guilty of some tactics similar to those of MSFT in recent times since they have controlled the PC hardware.  For example, they were requiring that if a PC vendor wanted to have early system design info for each new generation of microprocessor chip, they had to use Intel motherboards (not ONLY microprocessors) in their first generation machines.  Now, if there had been a reasonable alternative source of microprocessors, this might have been reasonable, but, of course, they had a functional monopoly.  In an industry that moves as fast as the PC business, this of course meant that ALL first versions of a particular generation were on Intel motherboards, thereby precluding innovation by the PC vendor themselves.  Or, if a vendor tried to go it alone, they would not be able to have a competitive product available during the critical first months of a new generation, which would have been tantamount to commercial suicide.\u00a0</p><p>There are other examples, as well--things such as Intel customers suddenly suffering parts shortages should they agree to use chips from an Intel competitor.\u00a0</p><p>Having said all this, I actually feel that this current investigation is probably good for INTC.  At the very least,it will cause them to reassess their business practices, and (if they are still doing this sort of stuff) change in ways that are better for us, their customers.  Given that Messrs. Barrett et al. are much less likely to take the arrogant approach of Mr. Softee, I would not be surprised to see a reasonable settlement that will be an obvious winner for everyone.\u00a0</p><p> -- Dave Kisker (received 6/11/98) Leave the Crash Helmet\u00a0</p><p>The waves of \"impending crash\" caveats that accompany just about every discussion of the U.S. stockmarket caused me to recall a sage's advice that, \"the market always does what the fewest people expect\".  Well, there are certainly many people who expect a crash, but there are also a lot of people who believe the market is headed much higher.  Is there another scenario that might be developing?  I believe so.\u00a0</p><p>First, lets think about the economic background that investors face.  The Asian economies have yet to find a bottom.  Several of our telecom equipment analysts have indicated that the companies they follow should report in line second quarter results, but that companies that distribute to Asia (the manufacturer's customers) are experiencing large increases in inventory. Result: channel stuffing will enable many companies to hit June quarter forecasts, but second half forecasts will come down.  If this is true, it explains why it seems that there have been a manageable number of pre-releases this quarter.  Nonetheless, the conference calls may be a different matter.  Conclusion: Domestic U.S. economic growth is unlikely to accelerate and should begin to slow as the year progresses.  If so, inflation will be very low and with it, bond yields will decline.\u00a0</p><p>If the market does what the fewest expect, what could this scenario mean for investors?\u00a0</p><p>1. Continued high valuations (P/E, Price/Book, etc.).  This will drive the valuation crowd crazy.  Investors will scramble for anything with growth among a diminishing list of growth companies.  This view helps explain the high valuations of internet stocks --- at least they have growth.\u00a0</p><p>2. Volatile individual stock prices.  These high valuations will cause companies that disappoint to be slaughtered because confidence in future growth will be shaken (and investors will move quickly to the next hot growth story).\u00a0</p><p>3.  Slowing growth, high valuations and periodic blowups will depress the typical investor's annual returns into the mid-single digits.  Few individuals or money managers will be able to sprint through an investment landscape increasingly littered with landmines.\u00a0</p><p>4. Low bond yields will cause total returns from fixed income instruments to be less than 6%.  Although the long bond might have a bit of price upside as yields drift toward 5%, total returns elsewhere along the yield curve won't provide double digit returns.\u00a0</p><p>Bottom line: Investors may get neither mid-teens returns nor a crash that enables them to buy on the dip.  Instead, we may be headed for a several quarter period of sluggish performance as valuations gradually come back to more normal levels.  As a old consumer goods analyst, this is exactly how large cap consumer stocks behave --- a few to several years of outstanding performance, followed not by a crash, but by flat line price performance as valuations catch up (take a look at KO in the late 1980's/early 1990's, or WMT more recently).\u00a0</p><p> -- Richard Davis Jr. (received 6/11/98) Hayden's an Asset\u00a0</p><p>An asset allocator is a welcome addition to TheStreet.com. I'd like to see a debate between Cramer and Vern Hayden on whether asset allocation maximizes returns or guarantees mediocrity.\u00a0</p><p>-- Roger Mann (received 6/10/98) Rewarded\u00a0</p><p>The only people who have been rewarded by the R.S. Contrarian Fund are those of us who were smart enough to get out last October when it was first nominated for the fund graveyard. Thanks TSC. Paul Stephens doesn't have a clue!!!\u00a0</p><p> -- Jim Puffer (received 6/9/98) Y2K, Revisited\u00a0</p><p>The article on E*Trade and Y2K is very interesting, but not necessarily accurate.  Many non-legacy systems, built in the past couple of years, are still non-Y2K compliant.  I know first hand of one bank in the Northeast, which shall remain nameless, that contract to have a new system built to keep track of its trading.  They engage a consulting firm, which built the system totally with 2-digit dates.\u00a0</p><p>Webtrends 3.5, a program that I use to analyze my web site, is not Y2K compliant.  This is not only not a legacy system, it is very recent and totally Internet oriented\u00a0</p><p>This is not to say that E*Trade is not Y2K compliant, I'm simply pointing out that just because it is \"Internet\" and \"recent\" doesn't make it Y2K compliant.  Given the legacy systems it must interface with, they could very easily have Y2K issues.  The article doesn't mention any statements from the company about Y2K.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, the securities industry is far ahead of just about any other industry in terms of awareness and progress.  The initial SIA testing is scheduled for this July, and their testing methodology is available on the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeff Jacobs (received 6/9/98) Perplexed\u00a0</p><p>I am still perplexed by Jim Cramer's characterization of his stock positions as \"inventory\". As near as I can ascertain, Cramer has long term opinions about the unfolding relative improvement of certain large companies. He believes that on a short term basis the markets in those stocks reach technically diifficult to sustain short term levels of excess enthusiasm or revulsion. His trading, therefore, is broadly \"fading\" the public order flow.\u00a0</p><p>This is not, however, what I think of as securities \"inventory\", which is the raw material of a truly market-making function, or the by-product of the distribution of new issues.\u00a0</p><p>In my experience, one of the most dangerous situations a trader can find himself in is confusing speculation with a market-making discipline. It often leads to a two sets of books mentality where the interim losses are consigned to a mental investment account and the mental market-making account feels great.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Cramer's frenetic trading may be wonderfully cathartic for his hedge fund's senior partner; but one wonders at the end of the day, how much does it add to the performance of the firm's underlying, and presumably carefully formulated bets? Is it in large part grist for the insatiable moloch of Wall Street entertainment against a twice daily TheStreet deadline?\u00a0</p><p> -- Paul J. Isaac (received 6/8/98) The Ax\u00a0</p><p>Eric Moskowitz: Good series of articles on the various axes' on the Street. However, it is at times difficult to keep an eye out for comments from these analysts on a daily basis when the news agencies that report analysts upgrades/downgrades don't identify the analysts as \"axes\".  Therefore, how about you guys putting out a \"The Axe Has Spoken\" column as soon as one of these analysts makes a change in recommendation.\u00a0</p><p>-- Brett Rule (received 6/5/98) New Fan\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: Regarding the recent discussion in your column about comments directed at JJC, I offer my 2 cents. First, I began reading TSC because of JJC. I subscribed for a year (and will continue for long after that, I suppose) because of JJC. I try to read everything he writes, whether in TSC or other venues. I have learned more from him about trading than could be bought at any price at any of this country's best b-schools. I am obviously an ardent fan of his.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I am also becoming an ardent fan of yours since your arrival at TSC. Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like seeing the issues from \"both sides of the street.\" It allows one to keep a clearer head, and that is what the entire exercise of TSC should be about. The \"sniping\" is taken for what it is: the good-natured ribbing of JJC from one who also admires his work and personna, while making valid points in disagreement. As I've said to you before, keep up the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bill Luttrell (received 6/5/98) More Helpful\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: If you stop offering your perspective on the market, I'll cancel.  Although I respect JJC, and his views re trading etc. are interesting, your columns are much more helpful in my effort to understand this market as an investor.  So much noise and confusion out there!  What we need is wisdom and perspective on things. That's why I read your columns and that's why I'm still a subscriber to TSC.\u00a0</p><p>-- Tim Mikkel (received 6/5/98) Fore\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: When people hassle you about [a recent column on] Dell here is another analogy that my explain your bullishness.\u00a0</p><p>The four best golfers at a private club are Mr. Dell, Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP. They always shoot in the 70's with Mr. Dell usually shooting a couple of strokes better than the rest. There are lots of other members at the club but while being good players, they can't really compete with the big four. The club they belong to is know as an easy course(wide fairways, flat greens, few trees and sand traps). It is easy to score well. This course is the equivalent of the PC industry of the last couple of years, growth being so rapid everyone makes money.\u00a0</p><p>The big four decide to go on a golf vacation. By some miracle they are able to play Augusta National. Augusta National is the golf equivalent of today's PC environment \"HELL\". Needless to say Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP are completely overmatched by the course and shoot horrible scores. Mr. Dell sucks it up and scrambles his way to to another sub 80 round. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP put on a brave face and say they are going to head to the driving range to make a few adjustments in their game. Things will be better tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>The fundamental difference between Mr. Dell and the others(Mr IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP) is that Mr. Dell can adjust to the rapidly changing environment as the environment changes. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP get annihilated by a change in the environment, go back home reflect on what happened, develop a plan to adapt, put the plan into action and hope things will be better tomorrow. They will always be killed by a negative change in the environment(hard courses) and do well when the environment turns positive(easy courses).\u00a0</p><p>The morale of the story is that Mr Dell is a better golfer and if your going to bet on Golf then bet on Mr Dell. CREAMer always rises to the top.\u00a0</p><p> -- Mike Yaffe (received 6/5/98) Kudos\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: I don't understand people who don't \"get it\". I think the ongoing debate between the you [and James Cramer] is one of the things that make TSC an interesting forum. I, for one, am sick and tired of all the whiners who expect this to be a promtional site that has nothing but \"buys\" and positive spin. Tell them to put on their rose-coloured sunglasses and spend more time at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.justhypeme.com\">www.justhypeme.com</url> , otherwise known as Silicon Investor. As a paying customer, I would rather see fewer articles written for newbies - your sophistication and expertise is what adds value.\u00a0</p><p> -- A. John Carlesso (received 6/5/98) Remember the Akron\u00a0</p><p>Jim Cramer: Enjoy your writing, your comments have made money for me.  Thanks, and here is my favorite mental image of trading psychology.  Have you ever seen the newsreel clips of the 1920's US Airship Akron disaster? The scene is like traders' thinking about when to take the loss or hold on.  The airship was met by a party of about a hundred ground handlers grabbing the ropes when a sudden wind gust and loss of ballast control caused the ship to bob up and down twenty, thirty, forty feet three or four times before rapidly climbing to a thousand feet unable to descend and then crashing within the half hour. There was a rain of falling men from different heights.  When does the trader take his loss?  Like the ground handler he has to decide if he lets go for a 20 feet fall to suffer a broken leg or hold on for a litte longer until the ship gets back to only to only a 5 foot hop down. One could even hope to get back down uninjured.  But then what if the ship just continues up and up\u2026  This happened to the ones who didn't let go before it was too late. However, one man did survive by hanging even to a thousand feet holding on for dear life and walked away from the crash landing.\u00a0</p><p> -- Sanford Friedrich (received 6/5/98) Trust\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I welcomed the wisdom you shared yesterday, it helped put things in perspective and clearly you were right until the market got sand-bagged by the Intel whiff. You are on the money though, the trust level is down - I think that's what I was trying to articulate in my mail yesterday. Why should a trader trust a market that constantly deflates and then only partially re-inflates the next day? Clearly, for a newbie like me it's hard to see why one should - how many times do you need to get your hands burnt before you stop after all?\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps that's the most frightening thing about the market - the general feeling appears to be falling to short sentiment, which is something I haven't had much experience dealing with (I did send mail to Smith a few weeks ago to go over it since I suspected we would end up in this sort of market sometime - didn't think it would be this quick though). Here we now have people using the chats on the Net to try to move stocks down, not up - perhaps the strongest evidence I've felt that the nature of the game is changing. I sure hope I'm wrong, since this is a game that I really don't look forward to playing in.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bryan McCormick (received 6/5/98) What Intel Didn't Say\u00a0</p><p>With everything INTC has already said about business slacking off, coupled with another wave of price cuts, does Intel really need to issue another statement saying its profits/revenue/growth won't be what people thought?\u00a0</p><p> -- Erik Milstone (received 6/4/98) Turning the Tables\u00a0</p><p>Since Mr. Cramer has been on CNBC so much, I would like to see him turn the tables and invite Mark Haines to show up for Mr. Cramer's new show, Real Money.  Thanks for all the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Delosso (received 6/4/98) Instructive\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I read everything you publish on TS.com and the articles that are most instructive (to me) are the \"I Can Screw Up Too\" ones where you describe and analyze your mistakes.  I too evaluate my mistakes from every angle with the intention of learning how to avoid making the same mistake twice.  Please keep it up.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jerry Daughan, Harpswell, Maine (received 6/4/98) Stretched\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your arguments seem more stretched by the day.  For some reason you don't want to acknowledge that there is a huge slowdown at the semiconductor and boxmaker level.  Dell, GTW, may be good trades, but it's ludicrous to suggest that the fundamentals are improving.\u00a0</p><p> -- Steve Vita (received 6/4/98) No Reply\u00a0</p><p>Dan Colarusso: I have filed several e-mail type complaints with the NASDR office and the SEC enforcement-tips office over the past few months when I have seen \"blatant\" volume-spike options trading in calls or puts where there was no news, AND then after hours that company will come out with dramatic 'material' information which causes massive trading in the underlying stock the following morning-open.  Some of these instances are so damm obvious that (you or I) figure that the regulators should have been able to see it, also.  Most of the time, I never hear back from them.\u00a0</p><p> -- Gerald E. Naugle, Boulder, Colo. (received 6/4/98) Hear! Hear!\u00a0</p><p>As regards JJC's motion to start a \"conference cancellation watch\" on TSC, here's a second.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Scott (received 6/3/98) Terrific\u00a0</p><p>Gary Smith: Every time I read one of your columns I get ready to fire up the email to tell you how terrific I think your pieces are -- informative, motivating, and written with a style and dynamic (i.e., the way the words move you along) that remind me how excited I used to get when I got a sentence or paragraph right when I was writing a newsletter a number of years ago.  This time I'm going to carry through and send this off.  TheStreet.com is one of my favorite web sites and you're a big part of the reason.  Thanks.\u00a0</p><p> -- Alan Kaplan (received 6/1/98)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#31664#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3XRV-0CD0-00MP-T1HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3642\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 1998 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>June 12, 1998 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0SIC8999 SERVICES, NEC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Online Transactions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNFQUM0RTIzMDQzNEU3MEExOTdFRDEzRjBDOEI1OEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVEMzEzOENBNTZGNDQ1RThEODQzODc2ODY3NDhDNDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N523930MC</classCode><className>INVESTMENT ADVISERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODQ2M0Q5NUExRUZENEY2NDkzMzlDMDVFNjFCNTY3MTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc</classCode><className>Investment Advisers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DNK2</classCode><className>DIARY KEEPING &amp;

She and her team have assembled a programme of almost 20 events that will take place in person or online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This Fringe is absolutely invaluable,\" says writer Dylan Coburn Gray, whose Malaprop Theatre company features in the line-up. \"For lots of people it's the only work they've had for six months or more.\"</p><p>The programme seems as wacky as ever. \"I use about 15 jars of mustard on stage,\" reveals the writer-actor Eva O'Connor, whose play about addiction and recovery, Mustard, will be staged at the Peacock. The work, which won a Fringe First award in Edinburgh last year, explores a young woman's troubles with ufiltered honesty. \"When I put mustard all over my body, the audience are always so horrified,\" O'Connor says, adding that \"the freedom you feel by doing something a bit weird on stage\" is what she missed during lockdown. \"Even if you had really solid mental health going into the pandemic, it's really hard to find someone who hasn't been negatively affected.\"</p><p>Originally themed Utopias and Uprisings, this year's festival now delves into darker issues about mental health and Orwellian state control. Coburn Gray was commissioned to create Before You Say Anything after shows were cancelled because of Covid regulations. One of only five live theatrical productions - down from the usual 50 or so - his production at Dublin Castle bucks the trend for monologues by using a cast of three. Using harrowing stories from the past, it explores public health and public order via nudity.</p><p>\"Care can quickly turn into violence - and that's topical, both in an illnesslockdown sense and a global moment around policing,\" says Coburn Gray. \"We hope no one who comes to our show goes away thinking, 'Oh yeah, I shouldn't wear a mask,' but we don't think they will.\"</p><p>Initiation, Matthew Bratko and Frank Sweeney's zany online play, is pure Big Brother. The premise is that each audience member joins a live Zoom meeting and is given dares. They start of ftame - eg \"take a shot\" - but get darker as sado-masochism and the occult invade the trippy space. \"There's nothing dangerous involved,\" Bratko insists, \"but we want you to feel like you're in danger without any actual danger.\" Beware: if you fail to do the dare, there will be consequences. \"The audience are watching each other and we're watching you do the dare, so if you don't do it ... you get kicked out,\" says the New Yorker, who voices the show live from the US.</p><p>Even our drag queens seem ruffled by the perilous undertones of the new normal. Patrick Scullion, aka Rosa Tralee, examines social media and questions its innocence in her comedy Youse: Biz From the Age of Surveillance C*pitalism, loosely based on Shoshana Zubof's book. \"How we talk about big tech and how we talk about Ireland ...</p><p>requires a certain amount of draggy thinking,\" she insists.</p><p>Writer-actor Caitr\u00edona N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa was once an on-screen, in-vision RTE continuity announcer, and her grandfather was a lighthouse keeper. Both roles have now been usurped by machinery. Transmission, her multimedia, one woman-show at the Peacock, relates what happens when she finds archive material about her long-dead grandfather online. With lives on pause and work practices changing, this exploration of time should capture the zeitgeist.</p><p>Fishamble's Duets co-productions are usually a Fringe mainstay, but this year there will be only one: Twenty Fifty, by Dan Colley and Fionnuala Gygax. It is another online interactive show, and promises a different guest collaborator with each performance.</p><p>An Post might reap further financial benefits from the social-distancing rules as A Rain Walk and 1000 Miniature Meadows involve getting instructions by post when you book tickets. In the former, you wait for a rainy day before completing the task - shouldn't take long. In the latter, we are encouraged to step into a garden and listen to a soundscape, which includes a \"conversation\" with bumblebees.</p><p>Other highlights include online interviews with \"difficult\" women over 70. It features Lelia Doolan, Bernadette McAliskey and Dervla Murphy. Broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rte.ie/culture\">www.rte.ie/culture</url> in four parts, its premiere is on September 15.</p><p>So, at least until September 20, it's business close to usual for Dublin theatre. As McGowan remarked: \"It's an industry [with] thousands of highly skilled people who want the same opportunity that others have been afforded: which is to adapt for the times and get back to work. c <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fringefest.com\">www.fringefest.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Big mix From top, Transmission, Coburn Gray, Mustard and Malaprop's Claire O'Reilly</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-162910326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SB-MY61-JCBW-N3VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 6, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;
