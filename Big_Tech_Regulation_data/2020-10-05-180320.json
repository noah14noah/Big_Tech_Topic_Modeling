This is called a speculative bubble.</p><p>But speculative bubbles only work if people think there's a greater fool out there somewhere. Today's tech start-up investment frenzy has a very defined chain of resale. First the angels and the crowd funders put in some money.

A lot of angels will lose money, but angels tend to be rich people who can afford to take the loss. VC funds will lose money, but VC is still a small piece of the US financial markets.

It\u2019s irksome, and it\u2019s also easy to mock, but in truth most of the battles between the digital Davids and Goliaths are much more complex.</p><p>Consider, for example, the fight this week between Apple and a small tech company \u2014 a quarrel that you might want to pay attention to since the outcome could have a lasting impact on the power dynamic between Big Tech and the rest of us.</p><p>The kerfuffle between the trillion-dollar tech giant and the founders of Basecamp, a nifty project management tool, centers on an innovative new email service that Basecamp created called Hey.com. As part of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html\">Hey.com</url> rollout, the company submitted the mobile app to Apple\u2019s App Store. A spot there is critical for its success.</p><p>And how \u2014 given that access to the mobile universe is controlled by just two companies: Apple and Google. As one person intimately familiar with the mobile ecosystem noted to me, Apple and Google are the \u201ctwo tollbooths\u201d for us all.</p><p>Tollbooth is just the right metaphor. While you can use various services like Hey.com on the web through browsers, when it comes to mobile, app developers are subject to whatever guidelines Apple and Google impose and the fees they charge.</p><p>Apple has asserted its curatorial might most strongly, by far, often in the interests of taming the sprawling and enormous app deluge. Their oversight includes efforts to protect privacy and eliminate dangerous developers who attempt to foist spam and malware on consumers. Mistakes slip through, but Apple runs a tidy ship.</p><p>Yet Apple has also changed rules in ways that many developers find capricious and unfair and, more to the point, scary. While complaints have been raised for a long time about what Ben Thompson of Stratechery calls Apple\u2019s \u201crent-seeking\u201d practices, many developers do not want to speak out for fear of falling afoul of Apple and, worse, getting banned from its store.</p><p>But not Basecamp\u2019s iconoclastic and outspoken founders, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, who took to Twitter and other media to complain loudly after the Hey.com app had been accepted by Apple and then flagged for being in violation of its rules last week. In practice, that means Hey.com cannot make crucial bug updates. The company was awaiting an appeal decision by Apple that came down Thursday and that demands that Basecamp make changes in order to keep its Hey.com app on the platform.</p><p>Apple executives had told me and others earlier this week that it erred in its original approval of Hey.com, since the email service, which costs $99 per year, did not include the Apple-friendly in-app payment system as required by its rules.</p><p>The payment system, the only one available to developers when using Apple\u2019s App Store, means Apple gets a huge cut when a customer buys digital goods like an app subscription (30 percent for the first year and 15 percent thereafter). Apple does not get a fee when customers sign up through the app\u2019s company website, and it&amp;#39;s worth noting that 84 percent of apps are free, and developers pay nothing to Apple.</p><p>There is no doubt that Apple\u2019s payment system is convenient for some developers. And Apple correctly touts that it has created a lucrative business platform for many companies ($519 billion in overall revenue in 2019). But because of Apple\u2019s cut, some companies try to minimize in-app transactions, either by avoiding offering in-app subscriptions at all (Netflix) or charging more for that particular sign-up (Spotify). Hey.com did not include Apple\u2019s payment tech in its app.</p><p>Apple has made exceptions for some services that fall into what it calls a \u201creader\u201d category and has given other services a pass for a variety of reasons; it has even struck individual deals to bypass grabbing a cut. Still, Apple has decided thus far that Hey.com does not merit special treatment, even though there are also some subscription email apps that don\u2019t offer in-app purchase technology and are allowed to operate on Apple\u2019s platform (for now).</p><p>Apple\u2019s approach can be confusing \u2014 and definitely irritating. It hasn\u2019t sat well with Basecamp, as evidenced in a tweetstorm by Mr. Heinemeier Hansson. While he has a reputation for speaking out, this time Mr. Heinemeier Hansson has ended up in one of the more epic App Store controversies (best boiled down to his accusation that Apple was acting like \u201cgangsters\u201d). He likened Apple\u2019s actions to smashing windows and burning down stores.</p><p>\u201cThey count on developers to stay quiet,\u201d he said in an agitated interview this week, referring to Apple executives. \u201cWe thought we were fighting an email market dominated by Google, but these were the real heavies.\u201d</p><p>Apple obviously does not agree with this assessment.</p><p>\u201cThese rules have been around the App Store since the day we started,\u201d said Phil Schiller, who is in charge of the App Store and noted that the company reviews over 100,000 apps every week. \u201cThere is no perfection here. We will admit it when we make a mistake and acknowledge that we also need to learn and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this was rejected for a good reason.\u201d</p><p>This dispute comes just as the European Union said this week that it had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html\">opened an investigation</url> into whether Apple unfairly shakes down developers vying to distribute their wares on the App Store.</p><p>The longtime Silicon Valley thorn <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html\">Margrethe Vestager</url>, the European Union\u2019s antitrust head, said the company had now \u201cobtained a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role,\u201d and, because of that, \u201cwe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\u201d</p><p>She was referring to problems first raised by Spotify, the popular music service, which is now in direct competition with Apple Music. Spotify\u2019s complaints of Apple\u2019s anticompetitive behavior, filed more than a year ago, led to the European Union move. Spotify\u2019s top lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, said in an interview with me that the situation with Hey.com is strikingly familiar.</p><p>\u201cI have to say a lot of Hey\u2019s experience is reminiscent of what we have been living,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is Apple continues to move the goal posts and change the rules to its advantage and the detriment of developers.\u201d</p><p>At a press event last week about the European Union investigation, Mr. Gutierrez used a sports metaphor, too, saying that \u201cApple acts as stadium owner, referee and player and tilts the playing field to favor its own services.\u201d He added that \u201ctheir selective and capricious enforcement is designed to put companies like ours at an untenable competitive disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want special treatment or a free ride,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cWe want fair treatment and the opportunity to compete without artificial obstacles put in our way,\u201d a point also made by the Basecamp team.</p><p>Spotify has thus pushed for a choice of payment systems within the App Store rather than having to use Apple\u2019s proprietary system, along with more ability to communicate with its own users.</p><p>Unhappy developers are not new for Apple or to any tech company. But Apple is not just facing regulatory issues in Europe.</p><p>The Justice Department has an open and active investigation specifically looking into Apple monopolization and self-preferencing in the App Store, said sources. The agency has already revealed that it is officially looking at Google over a range of practices around market power. And Congress is also prepping a big antitrust hearing soon, which Apple and other tech giants will likely attend.</p><p>Mr. Heinemeier Hansson testified before Congress last year, excoriating Apple, as well as Facebook and Google, before the House antitrust subcommittee. He ended his jeremiad with a plea, \u201cHelp us, Congress. You\u2019re our only hope.\u201d</p><p>He sounded more hopeless this week, calling dealing with Apple\u2019s app approval process a \u201cwheel of misfortune.\u201d And, referring to the now defunct browser that ran right into another tech giant\u2019s cross hairs, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson sent a text to me later: \u201cThe wheels of legislative justice turn slow. It didn\u2019t help Netscape any that Microsoft got some penalties years after its air supply had been cut off.\u201d</p><p>It goes without saying that this is not how Apple sees itself, having spent years brandishing its image as the breaker and not maker of chains \u2014 see the famous <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html\">1984 Apple Macintosh commercial</url>.</p><p>The question is whether anyone throwing a hammer at power these days can throw it hard enough to make a difference.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

It's irksome, and it's also easy to mock, but in truth most of the battles between the digital Davids and Goliaths are much more complex.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider, for example, the fight this week between Apple and a small tech company - a quarrel that you might want to pay attention to since the outcome could have a lasting impact on the power dynamic between Big Tech and the rest of us.</p><p>The kerfuffle between the trillion-dollar tech giant and the founders of Basecamp, a nifty project management tool, centers on an innovative new email service that Basecamp created called Hey.com. As part of the Hey.com rollout, the company submitted the mobile app to Apple's App Store. A spot there is critical for its success.</p><p>And how - given that access to the mobile universe is controlled by just two companies: Apple and Google. As one person intimately familiar with the mobile ecosystem noted to me, Apple and Google are the \"two tollbooths\" for us all.</p><p>Tollbooth is just the right metaphor. While you can use various services like Hey.com on the web through browsers, when it comes to mobile, app developers are subject to whatever guidelines Apple and Google impose and the fees they charge.</p><p>Apple has asserted its curatorial might most strongly, by far, often in the interests of taming the sprawling and enormous app deluge. Their oversight includes efforts to protect privacy and eliminate dangerous developers who attempt to foist spam and malware on consumers. Mistakes slip through, but Apple runs a tidy ship.</p><p>Yet Apple has also changed rules in ways that many developers find capricious and unfair and, more to the point, scary. While complaints have been raised for a long time about what Ben Thompson of Stratechery calls Apple's \"rent-seeking\" practices, many developers do not want to speak out for fear of falling afoul of Apple and, worse, getting banned from its store.</p><p>But not Basecamp's iconoclastic and outspoken founders, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, who took to Twitter and other media to complain loudly after the Hey.com app had been accepted by Apple and then flagged for being in violation of its rules last week. In practice, that means Hey.com cannot make crucial bug updates. The company was awaiting an appeal decision by Apple that came down Thursday and that demands that Basecamp make changes in order to keep its Hey.com app on the platform.</p><p>Apple executives had told me and others earlier this week that it erred in its original approval of Hey.com, since the email service, which costs $99 per year, did not include the Apple-friendly in-app payment system as required by its rules.</p><p>The payment system, the only one available to developers when using Apple's App Store, means Apple gets a huge cut when a customer buys digital goods like an app subscription (30 percent for the first year and 15 percent thereafter). Apple does not get a fee when customers sign up through the app's company website, and it&amp;#39;s worth noting that 84 percent of apps are free, and developers pay nothing to Apple.</p><p>There is no doubt that Apple's payment system is convenient for some developers. And Apple correctly touts that it has created a lucrative business platform for many companies ($519 billion in overall revenue in 2019). But because of Apple's cut, some companies try to minimize in-app transactions, either by avoiding offering in-app subscriptions at all (Netflix) or charging more for that particular sign-up (Spotify). Hey.com did not include Apple's payment tech in its app.</p><p>Apple has made exceptions for some services that fall into what it calls a \"reader\" category and has given other services a pass for a variety of reasons; it has even struck individual deals to bypass grabbing a cut. Still, Apple has decided thus far that Hey.com does not merit special treatment, even though there are also some subscription email apps that don't offer in-app purchase technology and are allowed to operate on Apple's platform (for now).</p><p>Apple's approach can be confusing - and definitely irritating. It hasn't sat well with Basecamp, as evidenced in a tweetstorm by Mr. Heinemeier Hansson. While he has a reputation for speaking out, this time Mr. Heinemeier Hansson has ended up in one of the more epic App Store controversies (best boiled down to his accusation that Apple was acting like \"gangsters\"). He likened Apple's actions to smashing windows and burning down stores.</p><p>\"They count on developers to stay quiet,\" he said in an agitated interview this week, referring to Apple executives. \"We thought we were fighting an email market dominated by Google, but these were the real heavies.\"</p><p>Apple obviously does not agree with this assessment.</p><p>\"These rules have been around the App Store since the day we started,\" said Phil Schiller, who is in charge of the App Store and noted that the company reviews over 100,000 apps every week. \"There is no perfection here. We will admit it when we make a mistake and acknowledge that we also need to learn and grow,\" he said. \"But this was rejected for a good reason.\"</p><p>This dispute comes just as the European Union said this week that it had opened an investigation into whether Apple unfairly shakes down developers vying to distribute their wares on the App Store.</p><p>The longtime Silicon Valley thorn Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's antitrust head, said the company had now \"obtained a 'gatekeeper' role,\" and, because of that, \"we need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\"</p><p>She was referring to problems first raised by Spotify, the popular music service, which is now in direct competition with Apple Music. Spotify's complaints of Apple's anticompetitive behavior, filed more than a year ago, led to the European Union move. Spotify's top lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, said in an interview with me that the situation with Hey.com is strikingly familiar.</p><p>\"I have to say a lot of Hey's experience is reminiscent of what we have been living,\" he said. \"The reality is Apple continues to move the goal posts and change the rules to its advantage and the detriment of developers.\"</p><p>At a press event last week about the European Union investigation, Mr. Gutierrez used a sports metaphor, too, saying that \"Apple acts as stadium owner, referee and player and tilts the playing field to favor its own services.\" He added that \"their selective and capricious enforcement is designed to put companies like ours at an untenable competitive disadvantage.\"</p><p>\"We don't want special treatment or a free ride,\" Mr. Gutierrez said. \"We want fair treatment and the opportunity to compete without artificial obstacles put in our way,\" a point also made by the Basecamp team.</p><p>Spotify has thus pushed for a choice of payment systems within the App Store rather than having to use Apple's proprietary system, along with more ability to communicate with its own users.</p><p>Unhappy developers are not new for Apple or to any tech company. But Apple is not just facing regulatory issues in Europe.</p><p>The Justice Department has an open and active investigation specifically looking into Apple monopolization and self-preferencing in the App Store, said sources. The agency has already revealed that it is officially looking at Google over a range of practices around market power. And Congress is also prepping a big antitrust hearing soon, which Apple and other tech giants will likely attend.</p><p>Mr. Heinemeier Hansson testified before Congress last year, excoriating Apple, as well as Facebook and Google, before the House antitrust subcommittee. He ended his jeremiad with a plea, \"Help us, Congress. You're our only hope.\"</p><p>He sounded more hopeless this week, calling dealing with Apple's app approval process a \"wheel of misfortune.\" And, referring to the now defunct browser that ran right into another tech giant's cross hairs, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson sent a text to me later: \"The wheels of legislative justice turn slow. It didn't help Netscape any that Microsoft got some penalties years after its air supply had been cut off.\"</p><p>It goes without saying that this is not how Apple sees itself, having spent years brandishing its image as the breaker and not maker of chains - see the famous 1984 Apple Macintosh commercial.</p><p>The question is whether anyone throwing a hammer at power these days can throw it hard enough to make a difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Yesterday (Tuesday), together with Alibaba's <person><nameText>Jack Ma, </nameText></person>and the World Economic Forum, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo announced[1] an initiative on enabling e-commerce.\u00a0 Azevedo said:I am very pleased to welcome Jack and Rick. It's great to have you with us, and to have the opportunity to launch this joint initiative together here at the WTO's 11th Ministerial Conference.The internet and new technologies are revolutionizing our lives. If you have a phone, you are now connected to a global marketplace. </p><p>This means entrepreneurs everywhere can leapfrog barriers such as physical distance, or lack of information, and leverage the opportunities that trade presents.This could be the greatest force for inclusion in the global economy that the world has ever seen.But inclusion is not automatic.Without the right approach, the big players could easily dominate this market at the expense of smaller businesses. Poorer countries could be left behind.If we want it to be inclusive, we have to work at it.We know that around 4 billion people do not yet have internet access. In least developed countries over 70% of people still cannot afford basic internet connection.This digital divide means that the benefits of digital trade continue to be unevenly distributed. But even with an internet connection in place, there are still many other barriers that can stop businesses from engaging in e-commerce.To take part you need to have the appropriate ICT infrastructure and services. You need to have functioning trade logistics. You need to have the legal and regulatory frameworks in place. You need to have access to finance. The list goes on.Getting this right is a challenge for all of us.WTO members are now discussing these issues - trying to deepen their understanding of the issues and look at how we can ensure that e-commerce is a tool for inclusion and development.So this collaboration on the Enabling E-commerce initiative comes at a perfect moment.Jack and I met in Hangzhou during the G20 last year. In April we welcomed him at the WTO in Geneva. We've been exploring how we might work together on these issues.And I have the great pleasure to say that we both share this vision of an internet for all; of e-commerce as a real opportunity for smaller players, entrepreneurs and regular citizens.So when the eWTP and the World Economic Forum approached us a few months ago with the idea of joining forces on a high-level, public-private dialogue on e-commerce, I didn't think twice.It struck me as an ideal opportunity to enhance this vital debate.Our three organisations combined can provide a unique platform to achieve this. So I am looking forward to working together to ensure that we realize the potential of e-commerce to change people's lives around the world. We will start this work straight away, with a meeting at Davos in January.This will be followed up by other events, including a major one in Geneva later in the year. But this is not just about holding events. It will be a continued results-oriented dialogue, and an evolving partnership.So I'm excited to get started.Thank you.For it's part Mr. Ma's Alibaba was also enthusiastic[2]. For the first time ever (to my knowledge-someone will surely correct me!) the WTO issued a joint press release[3] with an NGO, outlining a common venture. The NGO here, as mentioned, is the World Economic Forum, a pay-to-play association [4]of many of the world's leading multinationals.  A cabal between a multbillionaire in a BRICs country, a club of global mega-firms and the WTO to rule the cyber-world it-sounds like the plot of novel, or the paranoid conspiracy theory of some extreme anti-globalization group. But sometimes truth is stranger than fiction... None of the statements or press releases is too specific about the exact scope of the common \"work\" of the three partners-Mr. Azevedo refers to \"bringing a range of stakeholders together to further explore these issues.\" That will start, no surprise, with the January Davos meeting, where (assuming it still works as in the past) you either pay the World Economic Forum's stiff admission fees or you are so powerful or famous that you go for free. \"Range\" of stakeholders indeed. As for Mr. Ma, his organization refers to \"The World Trade Organization and the World Economic Forum have joined with the\u00a0Electronic World Trade Platform[5](eWTP) to launch a new initiative that aims to put e-commerce practice and policy front and center among governments, businesses and other stakeholders on a global level.\" That seems like an ambitious collaboration, which aims at promoting a certain policy direction, not just an open-ended stakeholder dialogue. But is it legal?\u00a0 Let's start with the constitutional charter of the WTO-the Agreement establishing the organization, often referred to as the Marrekesh Agreement.  Article V reads:1. The General Council shall make appropriate arrangements for effective cooperation with other intergovernmental organizations that have responsibilities related to those of the WTO. 2. The General Council may make appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation with non-governmental organizations concerned with matters related to those of the WTO.So the first question is this: will Mr. Azevedo be requesting forthwith the General Council to \"make appropriate arrangements\" for cooperation with eWTP and the WEF? In 1996, the General Council in a decision clarified what Members viewed as appropriate relations with NGOs. This decision states, in relevant part:\u00a0This interaction with NGOs should be developed through various means such as inter alia the organization on an ad hoc basis of symposia on specific WTO-related issues, informal arrangements to receive the information NGOs may wish to make available for consultation by interested delegations and the continuation of past practice of responding to requests for general information and briefings about the WTO. Though as mentioned details are scarce so far, it seems hard, given some of the language used by Mr. Ma, his organization, and even Mr. Azevedo along with the World Economic Forum, to see their joint venture as fitting within the notion of mere ad hoc symposia or informal arrangements. Much needs to be clarified. But the 1996 decision of the General Council also goes on to state: \"there is currently a broadly held view that it would not be possible for NGOs to be directly involved in the work of the WTO....\" Thus, in 1998 when the General Council adopted the Work Programme in Electronic Commerce[6], Members clearly envisaged a quite circumscribed involvement of NGOs: \"In undertaking their work, these[WTO] bodies should take into account the work of other intergovernmental organizations. Consideration should be given to possible ways of obtaining information from relevant non-governmental organizations.\" These and other elements of the 1998 Work Programme were re-affirmed by the General Council in 2015[7].  Unless I am missing something, the common venture between the WTO, the World Economic Forum and the eWTP goes considerably beyond the kind of cooperation with NGOs envisaged so far by the General Council. But of course the General Council, which has authority over relations with NGOs, can always change its mind. I find exciting the possibility that NGOs could actually get involved in the work of the WTO in a more integrated way; the mantra that the WTO is a \"member-driven\" organization sounds a little tired in the 21st century. But if we do go that route, shouldn't there be rules of the game on inclusiveness and ideological balance among organizations, disclosure of the interests represented, and the terms of membership in the organization? Why couldn't for example a group like Open Markets[8] be brought into this e-commerce venture, which has a perspective very different from Big Tech, an dis very concerned about the anti-competitive impact of Amazon's increasing dominance? As a matter of legitimacy, as well as legality, for now all roads lead back to the General Council [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2C1UKDy\">http://bit.ly/2C1UKDy</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2o10lrq\">http://bit.ly/2o10lrq</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/ecom_11dec17_e.htm\">https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/ecom_11dec17_e.htm</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1935338-a47b-11e4-8959-00144feab7de\">https://www.ft.com/content/c1935338-a47b-11e4-8959-00144feab7de</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.alizila.com/ewtp-finds-base-malaysia\">http://www.alizila.com/ewtp-finds-base-malaysia</url>/ [ 6]: file:///C:/Users/howserob/Downloads/274.pdf [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/gc_30nov15_e.htm\">https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news15_e/gc_30nov15_e.htm</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://openmarketsinstitute.org\">http://openmarketsinstitute.org</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IEAP1082571513223347503251761700246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IEAP-6855</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5R-PGS1-F03R-N2JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1484\"/><timeReceived>3:49 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Economic Law and Policy Blog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BABA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and called the 10 principles of the Internet Bill of Rights \"an admirable list.\" But will they actually become law?</p><p>Swisher says that depends on the outcome of the midterm elections. Rep. Nancy Pelosi told Swisher \"there would be action\" if the Democrats take the House in November.</p><p>Some of the principles touch on controversial topics unlikely to garner bipartisan support, such as making net neutrality rules the law of the land, rather than FCC regulations that can be changed as administrations come and go.</p><p>According to Khanna's Internet Bill of Rights, American consumers should have the right:</p><p>(1) to have access to and knowledge of all collection and uses of personal data by companies;</p><p>(2) to opt-in consent to the collection of personal data by any party and to the sharing of personal data with a third party;</p><p>(3) where context appropriate and with a fair process, to obtain, correct or delete personal data controlled by any company and to have those requests honored by third parties;</p><p>(4) to have personal data secured and to be notified in a timely manner when a security breach or unauthorized access of personal data is discovered;</p><p>(5) to move all personal data from one network to the next;</p><p>(6) to access and use the internet without internet service providers blocking, throttling, engaging in paid prioritization or otherwise unfairly favoring content, applications, services or devices;</p><p>(7) to internet service without the collection of data that is unnecessary for providing the requested service absent opt-in consent;</p><p>(8) to have access to multiple viable, affordable internet platforms, services and providers with clear and transparent pricing;</p><p>(9) not to be unfairly discriminated against or exploited based on your personal data; and</p><p>(10) to have an entity that collects your personal data have reasonable business practices and accountability to protect your privacy.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel for Public Knowledge -- a think tank that helped Khanna draft the principles -- thinks the principles are good guidelines but when it comes down to codification, said \"the devil [will be] in the details.\"</p><p>\"There are real questions about whether this should proceed as one bill or multiple bills,\" she told InsideSources. \"Privacy has much more bipartisan support, and aside from Capitol Hill, net neutrality has [a lot of] bipartisan support. I think they're articulating the right goals here.\"</p><p>Bohm said it's important not to read too much into the principles, because they're just that -- principles -- and actual legislative efforts will be much more precise. She thinks Congress will have a lot of work to do figuring out how to balance corporate and consumer interests.</p><p>\"Say I post a photo on Facebook and want to delete it, it's not nearly as problematic as hey, New York Times, I don't like this article you wrote about me, please take it down and Google, stop indexing it,\" Bohm said.  \"In Europe you have the right to be forgotten and you can do that, while in America we have the 1st amendment which protects your right to information.\"</p><p>Bohm said future laws regulating the internet and content will need some form of due process to evaluate when personal data or personal content should be corrected or deleted.  That, in turn, would lead to the question: How responsible are tech companies for the personal content on their platforms?</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects tech companies from any liability regarding the content to which they provide access. Earlier this year, Congress passed the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which made tech companies liable for content on their platforms that facilitates sex trafficking.</p><p>Just last week, a Texas woman sued Facebook for not doing enough to stop criminals from using the site to facilitate sex trafficking.</p><p>Roslyn Layton, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) who specializes in tech policy, agrees regulation of Silicon Valley is important, but worries the Internet Bill of Rights isn't a complete picture of the problems in the unfettered internet ecosystem.</p><p>Layton said there are four factors that \"create trust in the online ecosystem\": knowledge of the user, levels of technology, business practices and institutions. The problem with Khanna's Internet Bill of Rights, she said, is that it's only focused on two of those factors.</p><p>\"You have to have a holistic policy, you have to look at making sure people are educated when they go online, you need innovation, you need standards for business practices, and you need institutions that are up to snuff,\" she said. \"The Internet Bill of Rights is only covering one or two practices. We need to meaningfully make sure consumers get educated and engage responsibly online. We don't have that today. We should focus on the areas where we have a gap, which is consumer education and privacy.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Layton said, it's important Congress doesn't overdue any attempts to regulate the tech industry for fear of discouraging innovation or intruding on consumers' lives.</p><p>\"I think Ro Khanna is a thoughtful person, and an Internet Bill of Rights is a concept we can understand,\" she said. \"The original Bill of Rights is about protecting people from government intrusion. We have to keep that in mind, we should keep government from intruding on us. Ten percent of our GDP is information/communications/tech industry. There were 40,000 startups last year, and that's largely because from 1996 to 2016, we had a pro-growth, investment, and market policy. I think those things should be recognized.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

The data that enterprises value most? Consumer data, which includes demographic, lifestyle, and health data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Traditionally, consumer data has been in the purview of major established firms in the space, such as Experian and Acxiom, who have built vast data repositories by aggregating, organizing and monetizing data from a large number of public and commercial sources to help marketers target their audiences in ever-more refined ways.\u00a0</p><p>There is a gold rush for data as marketers, healthcare informaticists, and medical practitioners look for data-led strategies to drive revenues, reduce costs, and improve healthcare outcomes. However, healthcare professionals are less than satisfied with the results so far from their traditional sources pf patient medical information such electronic health records (EHR). The issues range from lack of data to too much data and not enough insights, the usability of data, and challenges with enterprise data management, to name a few. Consumer data adds a level of complexity to the mix while promising incremental benefits.</p><p>The emerging role of consumer data in healthcare</p><p>Today, the vast majority of use cases for consumer lie in marketing. Big Pharma, which spends billions of dollars in advertising, has used consumer data for a long time in defining target audiences and directing their media spend budgets. Large health plans, and to a lesser extent, health systems, have also been users of consumer data for similar purposes. Any way we look at it, the stakes are big, going by the vast amounts of money that data providers make by licensing their data to healthcare companies.</p><p>As the healthcare sector accelerates its move to value-based care (a recent set of proposals by the Dept. of Health and Human Services aims to shift a quarter of all healthcare payments to accountable care models), healthcare enterprises are looking to deploy data and insights as primary tools for population health management, precision medicine, evidence-based drug pricing and more. Advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) tools that require not just vast amounts of data but also diverse data sets for training and refining the algorithms are looking to consumer data for new insights about healthcare consumers.</p><p>Consumer data presents a huge untapped opportunity in healthcare's digital transformation, primarily as a way to understand and engage with healthcare consumers proactively. As newer sources of data become available from the proliferation of smart devices and digitization of consumer-facing processes, there will be a greater need to understand healthcare consumers from an omni-channel perspective and serve them accordingly.</p><p>Notwithstanding the potential, there are several challenges to be addressed before the use of consumer data becomes pervasive across healthcare enterprises.</p><p>Data as a risk-bearing asset</p><p>As healthcare data breaches continue unabated, and technology vendors get ensnared in attempts by hackers to indirectly infiltrate client systems, what may seem like gold to marketers may seem like risk-bearing assets to the healthcare C-suite, stung by penalties for HIPAA violation several years in a row. As data sources and data types increase, the lines have blurred between what has traditionally been considered consumer data, and what is now considered protected personal information.</p><p>According to Jay Cline, head of the privacy practice at consulting firm PwC, acquiring and deploying consumer data in healthcare enterprises is now a question of trust. And that trust is engendered not just through robust data security practices but also data privacy policies, which now include strict compliance requirements with the EU's data protection regulation GDPR and the recently passed CCPA consumer privacy rules in California.</p><p>Ownership of data and restrictions on use</p><p>After a long period of confusion, there is now clarity about who owns healthcare data - it is the consumer. Along with GDPR and CCPA, there is growing consumer activism about ownership and data use rights. Consumer data sourced from public sources has long been governed by restrictions on use.</p><p>For instance, notwithstanding the current excitement about social determinants of health (SDOH) as strong predictors of health and wellness, healthcare enterprises have to be careful about how they overlay third-party data on, say, a patient's criminal history, on electronic health records (EHR), or vice versa. The use of such data for making assessments about health risks may have direct consequences on a patient's cost and access to care. The ongoing concerns about the reckless use of consumer data by big tech firms such as Facebook have also highlighted the need for healthcare to ensure ethical sourcing of data before its use in a clinical setting.</p><p>Identity matching &amp; interoperability</p><p>My firm's recent research for one of our clients indicated that the two biggest challenges in using consumer data are interoperability and identity matching. Interoperability has long been a challenge in the world of healthcare, more so since patient medical records were digitized into proprietary EHR systems.</p><p>Even as technical interoperability challenges are being addressed through industry models such as FHIR, semantic interoperability (a common language for sending and receiving information) is far from being overcome. This is at the core of identity matching, complicated further by the fact that there is no universal patient identifier today. However, many of the larger consumer data providers have developed proprietary algorithms for identity matching to varying degrees of accuracy, albeit in the narrow context of omni-channel marketing.</p><p>In the next few years, we will see dramatic changes in the world of consumer data. Consumers will gain control of existing data about themselves and enrich it with data generated from their smart devices as well as their lifestyle and habits. They will also share it selectively with their healthcare providers and others (perhaps for some meaningful compensation, just as many enterprises do today with third-party data aggregators). For healthcare enterprises, consumer data will increasingly drive medical decisions in addition to marketing decisions.</p><p>The value of consumer data in future is evident in multi-billion dollar acquisitions of Acxiom by media giant IPG in 2018, and Epsilon by Publicis earlier this month. As consumerism gains ground in healthcare, healthcare enterprises and their data providers must come together to overcome the challenges and drive the digital transformation of healthcare.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3390669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYX-BCJ1-JBP6-P2XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><timeReceived>05:29 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IDG Communications, Inc.

Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce spending in the US and generated $296bn in revenues last year - more than the entire annual economic output of Chile, Greece or Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Outside China, Google handles 92 per cent of online searches and has used its platform to expand its dominance into the markets for online advertising, shopping and travel, among others.These are staggering figures but scale in itself is not necessarily a negative thing; far more important is the power that comes with it, and whether it is being wieldedin a detrimental way.</p><p>Among the many charges against the big tech firms is that they have used their power over the architecture of modern commerce to crush competition and hoover up unassailable mountains of personal data with which to build new products that others cannot match.</p><p>Online shopping is indicative of the problem. When Google launched its own price comparison service, it started putting its own results at the top, above rivals like Kelkoo.Referrals to those other sites from Google's organic search results plunged, suffocating businesses and cementing Google's own near-monopoly position.</p><p>Apple has faced its own charges of monopolistic behaviour from companies like Spotify (itself no angel) who must pay exorbitant 30 per cent fees to sell via the App Store.Amazon exerts a similar control over its own e-commerce marketplace, which is fast becoming the de facto shopping centre of the online world. All of the companies have staunchly defended their own actions and consistently denied wrongdoing.</p><p>But the conflict of interest in each case is clear. By owning the platform on which much of online commerce and interaction happens, they write the rules of a game in which they are both a player and the referee. This must be stopped.Where rivals do emerge with something new or innovative, they are usually bought up before they pose too much of a problem. Such takeovers should be assessed much more stringently in future, and blocked where necessary.</p><p>Regulators belatedly understand these issues but they are fighting a battle using obsolete tools built to stop the anticompetitive practices of a previous era.Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, has been the most active in taking the tech companies to task. But the experience of Google indicates the limits of the weapons at her disposal.</p><p>Google has been fined more than Euro 8bn sincethe EU antitrust investigations began in 2010. That amounts to just a few months' profits.In the meantime, as investigations have dragged on for a decade, Google has grown rapidly while countless potential rivals have been strangled, bought or deterred from entering the fray in the first place.</p><p>It therefore makes abundant commercial sense for large tech firms to act as they please, growing rapidly and swatting off fines as mere costs of doing business.They are too big, too powerful and too wealthy to regulate.So what is to be done?</p><p>Forcibly breaking up companies is a last resort but it is now firmly on the table. It's easy to see why politicians have seized upon it as a policy. It's eye-catching, easy to understand and has a feeling of toughness about it.However, it should not be necessary and is not, on its own, the most effective way of curbing tech companies' most damaging behaviour.</p><p>Amazon and Apple have huge market share in their respective fields, and have legitimate questions to answer about how they leverage that to reduce competition. Their role as owner of a platform as well as a seller competing on that platform must be looked at.</p><p>But Google and Facebook in particular pose a different challenge, which demonstrates how the current rules remain decades behind.Competition laws were designed with physical commodities in mind. They are intended to make sure that unfair practices do not cause people to end up paying more for a product than they otherwise would have.</p><p>But we are no longer in the era of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil, broken up by the trust-busters a century ago.The commoditywhich has become the most valuable in the world is not oil but personal data. Google offers its immensely popular and undeniably useful mapping, email and search services, for free. So how can it said to be causing detriment to people who use them?</p><p>This argument only holds if we believe our personal data is worthless. The bank balances of the tech companies demonstrate that acquiring it for free and selling it on to advertisers is, in fact, enormously lucrative.</p><p>Of course, we never actually use an online service for free. Instead we make a bargain - almost always without truly thinking it through - that we will hand over information about where we are, what we've searched for, where we live, what things we buy, who we speak to, what we are worried aboutto a company that will sell it for profit.Given the ubiquity of such \"free\"products, and the fallibility of human nature, can such a bargain ever be seen to be fair?</p><p>If all of our social circle uses Facebook or Instagram to connect, it becomes difficult to opt out, even if we have to hand over troves of personal information in return. The bargain, laid out over dozens of pages of terms and conditions, is a hugely lopsided one.</p><p>It is also the central element of the big tech's power. The more data they have, the more targeted their products can become and the more difficult it becomes for others to compete.How can a rival search company provide results as good as Google's when Google has data from the vast majority of previous searches?</p><p>A far more effective approach than breaking up the tech companies, and one that is gathering more and more support, would be to properly value our data, to make companies pay for it, and to recognise that inordinate control over it is bad for us all.Regulators should focus much more on whether or not companies are gathering more data than is strictly necessary, or using it in ways that are intrusive.</p><p>When the aim of the game is to target products at people based on thousands of pieces of information about them, curtailing the amount of data they can collect isan effective check on their power.It wouldstop the hoarding of a valuable commodity, which allows a handful of companies to build an impenetrable wall around themselves.The aim should not be to break up big techbut to even the playing field on which it competes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-DMGTCHPDSTRY000041790066ARTICLETEXT1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-GNG1-JCS0-D015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-week-that-shattered-facebook-privacy\">Facebook</url>, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies - Google and Amazon - that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook's case) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-week-that-shattered-facebook-privacy\">the harvesting of the personal data</url> of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes.</p><p>No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge - that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today's anti-capitalists - that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action. </p><p>Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \"To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\" Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things.</p><p>This concept, that Facebook et al  are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left - from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>After all, it's said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-week-that-shattered-facebook-privacy\">breakup of the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982</url>. AT&amp;T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&amp;T's stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants.</p><p>The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America's anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests.</p><p>That's going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books - and an array of other goods - at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&amp;D.</p><p>Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don't have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers - commercial or political - can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute.</p><p>This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don't is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful.

The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up. Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed Facebook, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies - Google and Amazon - that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook's case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes. No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge - that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today's anti-capitalists - that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action. Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \"To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\" Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things. This concept, that Facebook et al are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left - from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren. After all, it's said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the breakup of the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982. AT&amp;T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&amp;T's stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants. The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America's anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests. That's going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books - and an array of other goods - at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&amp;D. Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don't have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers - commercial or political - can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute. This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don't is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers. A twin-track approach - tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn't comply - looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new Glass Steagall act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn't happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again.5527falseA Facebook logo is seen on an iPhone screen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42538123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYB-2VD1-F021-63H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1884\"/><timeReceived>1:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

These calls have been recently articulated by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has signalled to the technology sector, especially the major players, that there will soon be federal regulation in place.Speaking with with Axios[1], the politician said: \"The current regulatory framework for these social media companies is going to pale compared to what it will be in a decade.\" </p><p>He also added that it was in the interest of big technology firms to accept that regulations are coming and to work with law makers in achieving a fair and workable solution.Play Video[2] As a counter measure, some technology firms are calling for regulation, as with the case put by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who is now a spokesperson for Facebook (and its head of global affairs). By adopting this tactic Facebook is possibly attempting to influence the shape of the regulation. Clegg said[3], when speaking to BBC Radio 4, there was a 'pressing need' for new 'rules of the road' in terms of privacy, election rules and data protection, adding: 'It's not for private companies, however big or small, to come up with those rules. It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so.\" One example mentioned by Governor Newson was Facebook's refusal to remove the doctored video of Nancy Pelosi (a matter covered by Digital Journal \"Facebook and disinformation - Pelosi video to remain[4].\") According Newson, failure to remove something so clearly an item of pro-Trump fake news is a clear sign as to why regulation is desperately needed. This would seem a very real possibility should the Democrats win the White House in 2020.  Also on the agenda are calls for the companies to be broken up, as a means to dilute their power and influence (this is a policy point by some U.S. presidential hopefuls, like Elizabeth Warren). Under Warren's plan[5], which is taking a different path to Newson's, some technology acquisitions like Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram or Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, would be rolled back in order to downsize the reach of the big players.

For many, it was not a cause for celebration - it was further evidence of the threat posed by the $863bn behemoth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that same \"Cyber Monday\", warehouse workers in San Bernardino, California, where serious injuries run at four times the rate of the national average, picketed for better conditions. In Brussels, regulators from the European Commission joined politicians for a first-of-its-kind \"Amazon symposium\", where union leaders called for its break-up. In Rugeley, Staffordshire, Labour MP Jack Dromey demanded the Seattle giant stop acting like \"a 19th-century mill owner\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The protests were more than the scattered cries of a few angry people. They represent something deeper: a sharp, fundamental shift in sentiment against the company. It is still loved by consumers, but regulators and politicians have turned against Amazon like never before. And if a Democrat enters the White House next year - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been strong critics - it could face the fight of its life against a government intent on breaking it up.</p><p>Louis Hyman, economic historian at Cornell University in New York State, said: \"There's always one company that becomes the evil face of despotic capital. That's Amazon. There's this sense of its inevitable dominance of everything.\" The question is whether Amazon is any different from Standard Oil, Walmart or the A&amp;P Tea company, which dominated US retail from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><p>Jon Nordmark, founder of consultancy Iterate.ai, said Jeff Bezos's empire was different. Amazon last year, he said, put nearly $30bn (\u00a322.8bn) into R&amp;D - twice as much as Apple, and almost triple Facebook's outlay. That investment - Amazon said the $29bn it puts into \"technology and content\" is far broader than R&amp;D - has gobbled up virtually all its $28bn in earnings before interest and expenses, Nordmark said.</p><p>The upshot is that Amazon pays little to no tax. Fair Tax Mark, an independent NGO, labelled it last week as the worst offender in Big Tech, claiming it had paid only $3.4bn in taxes in the past decade. That equates to just 12% of its already whittled-down profits. Nordmark said: \"They're using that $30bn basically to bankrupt all the people that don't do R&amp;D spending and pay their taxes.\"</p><p>Amazon took issue with the Fair Tax report: \"Amazon is doing the very thing governments encourage companies to do - paying all taxes due while investing billions in creating jobs and infrastructure.\"</p><p>It is simply doing it on a scale that none of its rivals touches. And given the breadth of Bezos's ambition, there is no reason to think this will ever change. What the billionaire has built is less a company than an astonishing ecosystem, gathering data from one corner of your life to offer you services in another.</p><p>Amazon is the biggest provider of cloud computing services. It runs an airline, a film studio, operates 500 grocery stores and employs hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. Last week it started to stream Premier League matches; it also launched a medical transcription service that records and files conversations with your doctor as part of its assault on the $3 trillion healthcare market. It has tens of millions of listening devices and surveillance cameras in people's homes, and has formed hundreds of partnerships with police departments for access to home video footage.</p><p>Amazon employs some 7,000 artificial intelligence researchers. It is the business equivalent of the Manhattan Project.</p><p>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that ahead of the presidential election, where the hollowing out of the middle class - and middle-class jobs - is a central issue, Amazon has become the bogeyman.</p><p>Hyman pointed to a 2017 JP Morgan study that found half of American middle-class families saw their monthly income fluctuate by up to 30%. In the bottom fifth, that proportion rose to 75%. He said: \"Just imagine the anxiety when your income goes up or down by 30% every month. Amazon is not what's wrong in society. It's not why income is unequal or pay-cheques are volatile. That all existed before the rise of Amazon as a major force in retail.\"</p><p>But Amazon, with its army of warehouse robots and relentless quest for more automation, has become the totem of iniquities of the modern economy. Its undoing could be the breakneck expansion of its logistics business: the warehouses, contract delivery drivers and pilots ensuring your packages arrive swiftly and safely. In three years, its workforce has nearly tripled from 230,000 to 650,000 as Bezos has cut out third-party suppliers and built a fulfilment colossus.</p><p>David Michaels, who, until 2017, ran America's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the government body that polices workplace safety, saw a sharp rise in violations at Amazon warehouses, where workers often stand in one spot to stack products onto an endless parade of robots. He said: \"If the robot controls your speed, and if you could lose your job if you don't keep up, you will do everything to keep up.\"</p><p>The GMB union says ambulances were called to Amazon's Rugeley warehouse 115 times in the past three years. Over the same period, a nearby Tesco warehouse made just eight calls. In America, it was found that contract drivers, under pressure to deliver parcels, had been involved in a rash of accidents, some of them fatal.</p><p>The company said: \"Amazon is a safe place to work,\" pointing to an injury rate it said was 40% lower than rival warehouse operations. Nordmark said: \"Amazon is attacking Fedex, Disney, Walmart, advertising companies, warehouse companies. It has a lot of enemies.\"</p><p>Amazon added that it thought some observers were \"attempting to sensationalise ambulance calls to Amazon by reporting numbers that include both personal and work-related health reasons\". It said it operated a \"safe delivery network\", with \"tens of thousands of drivers delivering tens of millions of packages to customers every week, almost all without incident\".</p><p>On the question of tax, Amazon said it was \"primarily a retailer where profit margins are low\", meaning that \"comparisons to technology companies with operating profit margins of closer to 50%\" were \"not rational\".</p><p>                   Trade war fears grow as Tax net snares Big Tech                   </p><p>Death and taxes: Jeff Bezos has been doing his best to avoid both. He has ploughed his wealth into longevity start-ups - and deployed all manner of accounting jujitsu to keep Amazon's tax bill low.</p><p>On the latter, however, authorities around the world are finally catching up. In April, Britain will impose a 2% tax on the money that Amazon and other Big Tech companies make from users on these shores. France imposed a 3% levy, retroactive to last year. Donald Trump has responded in kind to Paris's move, slapping tariffs on wine and other imports. He warned of more to come. Boris Johnson has vowed to push ahead with the tax plan, which begs the question of whether a much wider, more damaging trade war is on the cards.</p><p>The OECD group of top economies recently unveiled a new digital services tax, which it plans to impose by next month. America is vehemently opposed, saying it will hit US companies disproportionately.</p><p>Tech giants have long benefited from a tax system ill-prepared to deal with their businesses, which can collect vast sums in countries despite having little or no physical presence. That is about to change, and the repercussions could be profound. As his jousting with China, and now France, has shown, Trump has no compunction about launching trade wars.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-58489535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP3-YHW1-F021-644N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1271\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

However, continued economic growth depends on the outcome of the presidential election. The crisis opened the door for a surge in regulations, subsidies, and other special interest privileges under the guise of promoting the \"public health.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This progressivism\u2014a code word for cronyism\u2014presents a serious threat to America.</p><p>As Murray Rothbard explains, the original Progressive Era witnessed corporate and safety regulations, environmental laws, welfare and labor compensation, and new taxes that benefited favored corporations, bureaucrats, academics, and labor activists at the expense of the taxpayer. If trends continue, modern politicians will pass similar policies to benefit themselves and favored supporters, crippling economic activity. To properly understand this progressivist threat, one must recognize the motives, background, and ideological orientation of the original progressives. They were mostly Yankees, the descendants of the Puritans who stayed in New England or emigrated toNew York and the Midwest. They grew up in evangelical households that urged a remaking of society by coercively stamping out sin, particularly alcohol consumption. After earning PhDs in Germany, progressives preached their interventionism under the secularized guise of science and the public welfare. Furthermore, these social engineers supported eugenics, the science of controlling the labor supply to improve its overall quality. Lastly, progressives strove to revolutionize the world through foreign policy adventures.</p><p>In their struggle for economic privileges, progressives split into two groups. The corporatists championed protecting trusts and cartels from the vicissitudes of the free market. These big business advocates wanted to create trade commissions and other regulatory agencies to cripple competition and impose onerous compliance costs on small businesses. On the other hand, the socialists desired an overhaul of the capitalist system, blaring the trumpets for stringent antitrust regulation, radical labor laws, and redistributive taxes. President Woodrow Wilson embodied both strands, working with the two groups to enact the income tax, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>In many ways, modern progressives are carbon copies. They congregate in New England and live in coastal New York City, Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. While eschewing traditional religion, modern progressives are zealots for egalitarianism and social justice. They attended the Ivy Leagueand other elite American universities, empowering them with government-funded research. Although modern progressives disregard eugenics, they still advocate social engineering, championing egalitarianism for everybody except themselves while dictating what is morally acceptable. Finally, they are thoroughgoing foreign interventionists. Neoconservatism is actually a variant of progressivism, for as Angelo Codevilla explains, George W. Bush's wars were \"but an extrapolation of the sentiments of America's progressive class, first articulated by people such as Princeton's Woodrow Wilson.\"</p><p>The progressive movement still splits along corporatist and socialist lines. The former support a cozy relationship with Wall Street and \"Big Tech,\" welcoming various internet and safety regulations that would hurt smaller businesses without the appropriate ecommerce infrastructure. The latter advocate radically anticapitalist measures, particularly the dismantling of Big Tech, the Green New Deal, a universal basic income, and wealth taxes. With the exception of hostile antitrust lawsuits, big business corporatists are not against these measuresper se, provided they can acquire environmental subsidies and offload the cost of new entitlements and taxes onto the less wealthy (accomplished with the progressivist income tax and Social Security).</p><p>If Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden embody the corporatist mindset and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren the socialist mentality, then surely Kamala Harris is the modern Wilsonian.</p><p>Big Tech has funded Harris in various California elections in exchange for favorable regulatory oversight. Many former personnel now work for the large companies: a senior counsel left in 2018 to lobby on behalf of Amazon, Harris's first campaign manager works for Google, and her brother-in-law is the chief legal officer for Uber.</p><p>To pander to the socialists, Harris supports the profligate Green New Deal and a universal basic income, funded by new taxes that will \"only\" be levied on the wealthy. Harris exerts enormous influence over the extremely malleable (and increasingly senile) Biden, jubilantly telling Trevor Noah onThe Daily Showthat \"as soon as we get him in the White House, and even before with these task forces that we had, we were able to significantly push Joe Biden to do things that he hadn't signed on to before.\"</p><p>Clearly, Harris plans to run the show.</p><p>Similar to the legislation of one hundred years ago, the new progressive juggernaut presents an incredible threat to the United States. Its policies will impoverish the public to enrich elite businesses, politicians, intellectuals, and unions. This future looks bleak, and it must be stopped.</p><p>[Adapted from \"America 2021: The Threat of Progressivism,\" a talk delivered on August 29\u00a0in Orlando, FL.]</p><p>*About the author: Patrick is Assistant Professor of Economics at Florida Southern College.

He expanded Medicare's private insurance component and added a prescription drug benefit cheered by big pharma. Bush was even emboldened enough to launch an attempt at privatizing Social Security, the so-called third rail of American politics.</p><p>In early 2003, Washington Monthly editor in chief Paul Glastris and I began thinking about a story that would help explain why Bush was so successful. A major factor, of course, was the overwhelming public approval of his response to the 9/11 attacks. But there was also something else at play. Big presidential initiatives have long had to navigate the thicket of trade associations and other special interests known as \"K Street.\" Until the Bush years, K Street--so named for the Washington avenue that historically housed many lobbying firms and Beltway corporate outposts--always played both sides. Big companies and trade associations tended to employ a mix of Republican and Democratic lobbyists, so they would be well connected no matter who was in charge in any given year. Lobbyists were linked to their old bosses on Capitol Hill or in executive agencies, but loyal first to their new ones in the private sector. Many major sectors hedged their bets, funneling comparable amounts of campaign cash to both parties so they would never be left out in the cold. In the 1990s, a fashion grew for bipartisan lobbying firms, with both Republican and Democratic partners, designed to serve corporate clients in any political climate.</p><p>From the rise of the modern administrative state through the Clinton years, K Street held enormous power to reshape legislation to its liking or, failing that, to block it altogether. But during Bush's first term, K Street was uncommonly pliant, even subdued. The Republican Party had conquered Washington's special interests. In my piece for the Monthly, I set out to explain how.</p><p>The magazine had recently moved into new offices near the White House, a stone's throw in distance-but worlds away culturally--from the steakhouses and sleek offices of K Street. Over deli sandwiches and plates of homemade moussaka---supplied by the late Kukula Glastris, our consummate books editor and the unofficial den mother to the underpaid, twentysomething Monthly staffers--Paul and I batted around ideas. I interviewed dozens of politicians, lobbyists, and former Hill staff, who provided our first clues.</p><p>K Street, it turned out, didn't just work for its corporate clients anymore. Now, under Bush, it worked for the GOP, too. Over the previous decade, the party had built a mirror image of the old Democratic political machines. The spoils were not judgeships or jobs in the county clerk's office, but mid-six-figure jobs on K Street and lucrative contracts for privatized government programs--with a cut of those profits steered back in the form of campaign contributions to Republican committees and candidates. Each week, senior Republican leaders on the Hill met with a small group of ex-staffers to discuss job openings at leading trade associations and corporate offices. The goal was to stock K Street with party functionaries, and to purge the Democrats who remained.</p><p>We called my story \"Welcome to the Machine.\" (This title was supplied by Paul, who assured me that \"everyone\" would get the Pink Floyd reference.) As a young reporter, it was my education in a certain kind of journalism, long prized at the Monthly and now much more common at mainstream news organizations, sometimes referred to in journalism as a \"conceptual scoop.\" While my reporting yielded fresh details on the inner workings of the machine, it wasn't exactly investigative. Many examples in my story were drawn from daily newspaper coverage. The new machine, it turned out, had been sitting in plain sight. My job was to make better sense of the existing facts and explain how this new world worked to an audience that was eager for answers.</p><p>As an investigative reporter at the New York Times, I've broken some big stories. But few have had the intellectual impact, or sheer shelf life, of \"Welcome to the Machine.\" Paul Krugman devoted a column to it, spurring broad discussion. Bloggers (remember those?) across the political spectrum posted and debated the piece. The story was eagerly consumed by liberal and Democratic readers adrift in the post-9/11 era- Even years later, I would notice the piece cited in articles, books, or opinion pieces.</p><p>Remnants of the Republican K Street machine persist. Until very recently, some of Washington's big corporate trade associations functioned as virtual organs of the GOP. The old bipartisan lobbying shops, a relic of the divided government of the 1980s and '90s, have largely disappeared, replaced by firms that liaise almost exclusively with lawmakers of one party or the other. The size of the lobbying industry has increased dramatically, creating even richer potential spoils. Policy expertise resides more with well-paid former Hill aides than with their meagerly compensated counterparts still toiling in Congress.</p><p>But as I read the story back now, I am struck by how much more fragile the K Street machine was than it seemed at the time. When I wrote my story, political giving by major industries had tilted two to one in favor of the GOP. Yet money always follows power. The election of Barack Obama forced industries to recalibrate their political giving. The trauma of the financial crash and the Democrats' successful efforts to overhaul the health care system fractured some political alliances and sealed others. Wall Street became more estranged from the Democrats in the wake of the financial crash and Obama's efforts at financial reform, but the emerging powers of big tech drew closer. The 2016 election accelerated the trend. By the 2018 midterms, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, major industries were giving slightly more to Democrats in aggregate than they were to Republicans, bolstered by strong Democratic fund-raising in the financial and real estate sector and liberals' dominance in the technology, health care, and legal professions.</p><p>The Tea Party movement also disrupted the K Street machine, creating an insurgent class of Republican lawmakers and candidates who painted dependable establishment conservatives as weak-kneed squishes, the better to knock them off in primaries. The resulting civil war strained the GOP's ability to smoothly mesh policy outcomes and political power.</p><p>Then came the ultimate political insurgent, Donald J. Trump. Many traditional Republican donors in the business world closed their wallets to candidate Trump during the 2016 cycle, believing him to be politically toxic and unelectable. Yet during his first two years as president, Trump granted establishment Republicans and their industry allies an almost unprecedentedly free hand in shaping policy. In some sectors--energy, in particular--government and business have become almost indistinguishable. At the start of this year, former lobbyists ran four different federal agencies. When it comes to environmental and extractive policies, the machine whirs along like never before. And it can still deliver policy outcomes: The Trump tax cut, engineered by Republicans on Capitol Hill, was in some ways a signal machine triumph of the Trump era.</p><p>But by thrusting the GOP's id--white identity politics--to the fore, Trump has made K Street-oriented machine politics more difficult for his party to maintain. His firmly held, sometimes incoherent views on immigration and trade set him on a collision course with the Fortune 500 companies that cheered his tax cuts and regulatory policies. He has feuded with major companies to settle political gripes, promising new regulations (!) to combat alleged anti-conservative censorship by Facebook and Google and seeking to stymie AT&amp;T's merger with Time Warner to punish the latter for news coverage by its subsidiary, CNN. At times, Trump has suggested that he would break with big pharma, perhaps the congressional GOP's most loyal ally, over drug prices. Trump's Republican Party is thus both more corporatist than ever, and less.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's leftward drift means that its candidates face growing pressure to forego financial support from lobbyists, big business groups, and corporate PACs. Increasingly, they can afford to do so, thanks to the rise of efficient grassroots fund-raising, through online platforms like ActBlue. Even if Democrats won enough power in 2020 to construct a countervailing K Street machine, it's not clear that they would want to--or need to.</p><p>Ultimately, political machines thrive on certainty and order. Trump is allergic to both. His policies are driven more by resentment, instinct, and ego than by a considered strategy to gain and hold power. Trumpian turmoil in Washington has certainly been lucrative for K Street; total lobbying spending has begun to climb again since he took office, as businesses scramble to avoid the president's Twitter flamethrower or carve out special deals and dispensations under the cover of his chaos. But it has not been good for the old K Street machine. Swaths of the old Republican professional class in Washington have been displaced by a new group of Trump acolytes and hangers-on, building a mini patronage machine inside the carapace of the old one. Formerly C-list GOP operatives, like Corey Lewandowski, have become the Beltway's new power brokers, setting up new consultancies and lobbying shops to monetize their connection to Trump.</p><p>But Trump's reelection appears to be an uphill climb. While the Trumpers scramble to cash in while they can, some mainstays of the Bush-era machine are eying an exit. As the Washington Post reported in April, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--Washington's most powerful lobbying group--has faced an internal revolt from members who believe it is too aligned with the Republican Party and too timid in challenging Trump on issues like trade and global warming. Whether they are followed by other cogs in the K Street machine will depend on whether Trump and his party can build an enduring political coalition around a declining pool of mostly white voters. Unless it is properly maintained--lubricated by a steady supply of money, jobs, and policy victories--even the most exquisitely engineered contraption eventually grinds to a halt.</p><p>Nicholas Confessore is a New York-based political and investigative reporter at the New York Times and a staff writer at the New York Times Magazine.

Last autumn, not long after she had ordered Apple to pay ?13bn ($14.5bn) in back-taxes to Ireland, to the fury of many in America, she flew across the Atlantic on a charm offensive. The Americans were not charmed; Ms Vestager was unmoved. Buckling up for the flight home, she tweeted that she had never felt so European.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since she assumed her current role in November 2014, Ms Vestager has had several high-profile clashes with American tech firms. In May she fined Facebook ?110m for misleading EU trustbusters about its takeover of WhatsApp, a messaging service. In June a long-running investigation resulted in a ?2.4bn fine on Google for using its search engine to promote its own comparison-shopping service. EU trustbusters have also charged Google with using its Android operating system to promote its mobile-phone apps and services over those of rivals. That investigation continues. </p><p>Ms Vestager has said the job of agencies like hers is \"not to get too cosy with special interests but to have the courage to defend the public interest\". Few would quibble with that. All too often regulators and trustbusters come to see the world as big business sees it, to society's cost. But a long-standing concern is that the commission acts as prosecutor, judge and executioner in cases against dominant firms. The courts in Europe have been a weak check on its powers in recent years in this regard. </p><p>That may be changing. Last week the European Court of Justice asked the lower courts to look again at the economic merits of a case against Intel, which in 2009 was fined ?1.06bn for abusing its dominant position in chipmaking. But the courts move slowly. Some worry that a number of Ms Vestager's recent, crowd-pleasing victories over big tech firms may come back to haunt the commission. And by then she might have moved on to a bigger job. </p><p>To assess how fair that concern is, it helps to be clear about how competition policy varies between America and Europe. There are three main parts to the job: the control of mergers, the policing of cartels, and checks on \"dominant\" firms, or those that supply the bulk of a market. Cartel-busting is quite similar in both places. Europe has mimicked the American policy of offering immunity to firms that rat on their fellow price-fixers, for instance. The EU approach to mergers, especially \"horizontal\" tie-ups between competitors in the same industry, is also a lot like America's method (though research suggests that merger control has been far more lax there). </p><p>The big transatlantic gap is in the policing of dominant firms (known in Europe as Article 102 cases, after the relevant passage in the EU treaty). Europe's trustbusters have been far more likely to worry that a dominant company, of the sort that technology industries tend to produce, will force rivals out of business, leaving consumers facing less choice, higher prices and worse services. Trustbusting in America, in contrast, has taken its cue from the economist Joseph Schumpeter who believed that the promise of monopoly profits is a spur to the innovation and risk-taking that drives economic growth. In this view, the dominance of tech firms is likelier to attract competition than to crush it. </p><p>Since Ms Vestager took office, a mostly polite difference in philosophy has hardened. Brussels believes the growing power of big tech firms to shape politics, society and the economy requires a counterweight. The battle is of greater urgency, the commission reckons, because the data that tech monopolies have accumulated make it far harder for upstart firms to displace them or keep them in check. </p><p>Few in Silicon Valley, meanwhile, doubt that competition policy in Europe is anything but thinly veiled protectionism aimed at shielding the region's old-economy firms from disruption. Challenged on whether she might have tech-envy when it comes to American giants, Ms Vestager resolutely denies a bias. There are Article 102 cases under way against many non-American firms, including Russia's Gazprom. </p><p>Even so, she has brought a different approach to competition policy, says Robert McLeod, of MLex, a market-risk agency. Her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, was more inclined to compromise. He might well have agreed a settlement with Google over the shopping case, insiders say. His predecessor, Neelie Kroes, a Dutch former politician, was bold but tended to follow the advice of her civil servants. </p><p>Ms Vestager seems to relish a confrontation. Her principles and zeal probably come from her upbringing as the daughter of Lutheran ministers. As Denmark's deputy prime minister, she regularly upstaged her boss, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. She has a knack of boiling down complex issues to catchy soundbites, such as \"Europe is definitely open for business but not for tax evasion.\" In some of the battles she has started, tech giants had a case to answer. Facebook's misdeed, for instance, is not much disputed. The Google Android investigation seems to have merit. </p><p>But in other headline-grabbing cases, it is not clear how consumer welfare has been much enhanced. The commission said Google abused its dominance of online search to promote its own comparison-shopping service and relegate those of rivals. Yet it did not show, for instance, that consumers were denied a superior service as a consequence. Google said this week that it will appeal against the decision. </p><p>The benefit to competition from the Apple tax case is harder still to fathom. Under European law, it is illegal for a government to provide a subsidy to an individual firm, known as \"state aid\", which gives it an edge over its rivals. At its best, the enforcement of state-aid rules has severed the links between governments and national champions, such as flag-carrying airlines. Very often such firms are loss-making and a burden to the exchequer. Preferential treatment makes it hard for better firms to challenge them\u2014so state-aid rules that cut them loose hugely benefit consumers. </p><p>But the case against Apple does not fit the paradigm. The thrust of the commission's argument was that Ireland cut a bespoke tax deal with Apple that was not open to other companies, equivalent to state aid. But which firm is the peer against which Apple's tax affairs should be gauged? How was competition distorted? Where are the chronic inefficiencies? The politics of the case seem clearer than the competition-policy benefits. Big EU states have long been critical of Ireland's 12.5% rate of corporate tax. But it is a stretch to use state-aid rules to achieve the sort of tax harmonisation that is favoured in Brussels. </p><p>Many in the competition-policy establishment were deeply dismayed by the Apple decision. Ms Kroes publicly criticised the use of state-aid rules (a commission spokesperson later shot back that this was all too predictable from someone in the pay of Silicon Valley\u2014Ms Kroes is on Uber's public-policy advisory board). Mr McLeod reckons the judgment will be overturned by the courts. </p><p>Perhaps Ms Vestager suspects this, too. Her main aim may have been to get the issue of corporate-tax evasion firmly on the agenda. If so, it was a tactical masterstroke. It also raised her personal profile. She is one of the front-runners to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission. </p><p>Ms Vestager is described by one of her peers as \"the most politically effective\" trustbuster in recent memory. It is a judgment, admiring and grudging at the same time, that others in the field share. There is admiration that she has raised the profile of competition policy in a way that her dry and technocratic peers and predecessors could not. And there is a grudging acknowledgment that her brand of populist policymaking might be just what is needed to address the growing heft of big firms. But mixing politics with trustbusting so overtly is a dangerous game. The competition directorate's standing as a neutral arbiter may get damaged in the process. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-656O8S8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGD-WD31-DY2R-21BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Microsoft\u2019s social media stakes rely heavily on LinkedIn, a network aimed more at working professionals rather than a more casual and friend-driven approach that Facebook has.   Vishal Mathur       It seems that Microsoft is considering buying the incredibly popular but under-fire social media network TikTok. Microsoft is believed to be in talks with Chinese tech company ByteDance to buy the social media app\u2019s US operations. This comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has again expressed concerns about the national security threat that the Chinese-owned app poses and threatened to ban it in the US altogether. India banned TikTok a few weeks ago as part of a larger list of Chinese owned apps that are no longer accessible in India.   TikTok is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, valued at around $100 billion. It is unclear at this time as to how advanced the talks between Microsoft and ByteDance really are and what terms the two tech giants are looking at, if at all. This development was earlier reported by Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino who tweeted, \u201cMy banking sources say they are looking at it; can't guarantee a purchase but this thing is being shopped and one of the stops has been @Microsoft\u201d.    Earlier, Trump had made his intentions clear. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at TikTok, we may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There\u2019s a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok,\u201d said Trump while speaking with reporters.   In China, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 governs all tech companies that are based in China or are under Chinese ownership. The law mandates all businesses to share any and all information that the Chinese Government may ask for. This is something that is worrying governments around the world, including India.   It is also not clear what Microsoft\u2019s potential purchase of TikTok would mean for the structure of the social network\u2019s operations in the country, and whether any Chinese investors would retain a stake in the company. It is believed that the US administration is weighing its options whether it can force ByteDance to sell its US operations or whether the company can be added to the \u201centity list\u201d that prevents American companies from conducting any business with these companies. Chinese tech company Huawei was on this list last year, and suspicions continue to circle around Chinese tech companies regarding the data they share with the Chinese government.   At this time, Microsoft\u2019s social media stakes rely heavily on LinkedIn, a network aimed more at working professionals rather than a more casual and friend-driven approach that Facebook has, for instance. Yet, Microsoft must also consider the implications of such an acquisition, if at all. Earlier this week, the big tech companies, Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon testified at the US Congress antitrust hearing about business practices and regulation. Microsoft has managed to stay under the radar and out of the attention of regulators in the US mostly because it focused on business consumers. With a TikTok purchase for instance, which is as consumer centric as it can be, Microsoft might come under scrutiny.    TikTok has more than 800 million users worldwide. It was acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and is incredibly popular with the demographic that is also the target audience for the likes of Facebook, Instagram and Snap.   Earlier this week, it was reported that the Indian authorities are scanning as many as 275 more apps for potential user privacy violations and national security threats. This follows the ban on 59 Chinese-owned apps last month, a list that included the very popular social media app TikTok. It is believed that the latest list of apps under the scanner include the incredibly popular game PUBG Mobile, ecommerce platform AliExpress and another popular game Ludo World.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42732420427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GM-XKN1-F07F-8148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>News18.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CTM6</classCode><className>LINKEDIN CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Microsoft is believed to be in talks with Chinese tech company ByteDance to buy the social media app\u2019s US operations. This comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has again expressed concerns about the national security threat that the Chinese-owned app poses and threatened to ban it in the US altogether. India banned TikTok a few weeks ago as part of a larger list of Chinese owned apps that are no longer accessible in India.   TikTok is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, valued at around $100 billion. It is unclear at this time as to how advanced the talks between Microsoft and ByteDance really are and what terms the two tech giants are looking at, if at all. This development was earlier reported by Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino who tweeted, \u201cMy banking sources say they are looking at it; can't guarantee a purchase but this thing is being shopped and one of the stops has been @Microsoft\u201d.   Earlier, Trump had made his intentions clear. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at TikTok, we may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There\u2019s a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok,\u201d said Trump while speaking with reporters.   In China, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 governs all tech companies that are based in China or are under Chinese ownership. The law mandates all businesses to share any and all information that the Chinese Government may ask for. This is something that is worrying governments around the world, including India.   It is also not clear what Microsoft\u2019s potential purchase of TikTok would mean for the structure of the social network\u2019s operations in the country, and whether any Chinese investors would retain a stake in the company. It is believed that the US administration is weighing its options whether it can force ByteDance to sell its US operations or whether the company can be added to the \u201centity list\u201d that prevents American companies from conducting any business with these companies. Chinese tech company Huawei was on this list last year, and suspicions continue to circle around Chinese tech companies regarding the data they share with the Chinese government.   At this time, Microsoft\u2019s social media stakes rely heavily on LinkedIn, a network aimed more at working professionals rather than a more casual and friend-driven approach that Facebook has, for instance. Yet, Microsoft must also consider the implications of such an acquisition, if at all. Earlier this week, the big tech companies, Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon testified at the US Congress antitrust hearing about business practices and regulation. Microsoft has managed to stay under the radar and out of the attention of regulators in the US mostly because it focused on business consumers. With a TikTok purchase for instance, which is as consumer centric as it can be, Microsoft might come under scrutiny.   TikTok has more than 800 million users worldwide. It was acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and is incredibly popular with the demographic that is also the target audience for the likes of Facebook, Instagram and Snap.   Earlier this week, it was reported that the Indian authorities are scanning as many as 275 more apps for potential user privacy violations and national security threats. This follows the ban on 59 Chinese-owned apps last month, a list that included the very popular social media app TikTok. It is believed that the latest list of apps under the scanner include the incredibly popular game PUBG Mobile, ecommerce platform AliExpress and another popular game Ludo World.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42732506707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GM-XKN1-F07F-8187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

What's at Stake?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this Washington Journal interview, Ashley Gold, a technology reporter for Politico, previews why social media companies are testifying and what is at stake. Gold discusses the challenges posed by ads being purchased by foreigners to influence U.S. elections. She also describes how Twitter and Facebook will testify, but Google would not participate.</p><p>Back in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered testimony to a mostly hostile Congress.</p><p>I wrote this blog on the Facebook situation and related issues back in April of this year, with this conclusion:</p><p>\"The current Facebook story is perhaps the tipping point for more global privacy protections at a time when the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are also coming into effect in Europe. ...</p><p>The tech industry is about to see an overhaul in expectations regarding what it means to \"trust but verify\" security and privacy protections of data collected.\"</p><p>Big Tech Testimony Outcomes?</p><p>So what actually happened this past week? One result, as reported by C|Net, were these quotes coming from Sen. Mark Warner from Virginia.</p><p>\"The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end,\" he said during testimony Wednesday. \"Where we go from here is an open question\" [...]</p><p>\"It wasn't stupid questions, it wasn't 'Internet 101,' so I think at least from the committee standpoint, I think we feel like we're moving the ball,\" he said.</p><p>He was also disappointed with Google, which didn't attend the hearing, despite an invitation being sent to its cofounder and parent company's CEO Larry Page.</p><p>\"Google made a huge mistake by not attending our hearing,\" he said. \"And all that will do is simply raise questions about certain areas beyond even Russian interference that people want to ask questions on.\"</p><p>Twitter and Facebook offered a laundry list of actions they are taking to address concerns. You can see the full testimony here.</p><p>The Washington Post focused more on the content and style of those who did testify. It's tech vs. lawmakers on Capitol Hill today. It's also Sandberg vs. Dorsey.</p><p>\"Their differing approaches were on display as the pair entered the Senate Intelligence Committee's hearing room on Wednesday morning, both wearing simple black suits (Dorsey didn't wear a tie). An experienced political operator, Sandberg dove into her talking points as she readily answered questions and barely looked at her notes. Dorsey gave more direct responses, went off script and looked at his phone several times. His Twitter account sent tweets during his opening remarks.</p><p>Their approaches were tested by lawmakers, who grilled the executives with questions about their business models, privacy, disinformation, abuse of their services by governments and foreign actors, and their readiness to prevent that abuse in the run-up to the U.S. midterms. Sandberg and Dorsey's responses could impact regulation of the tech industry, a prospect both acknowledged during the hearings. ...\"</p><p>You can also watch the Twitter executive's testimony and questioning for the House Energy and Commerce Committee here:</p><p>What Regulation Is Possible? Could We See an 'Honest Ads Act?'</p><p>To understand the complexities involved with tech legislation, it is helpful to go back to this March 5, 2018 article by Marketwatch.com which covers the \"5 thorniest questions about regulating big tech.\"</p><p>Those 5 questions/areas include:</p><p>* The first is privacy.</p><p>* The second issue is market power.</p><p>* A third issue concerns the control of information.</p><p>* The fourth issue is the concentration of wealth.</p><p>* The last issue concerns national security and national economic interests.</p><p>On the last point, the article describes the national security challenges this way: \"A number of tech firms, including Microsoft and Facebook, declared that they will not assist any government in conducting offensive cyberwarfare operations, and that they will defend unconditionally any countries or individuals targeted by a cyber attack. Does that really include a cyber attack against North Korea or Iran to preempt a nuclear event?\"</p><p>In another interview with eWeek, Sen. Warner described 20 proposals that could find their way into new legislation. Here is an excerpt:</p><p>\"The impact of social media and large technology companies on society has grown to the point that many in Congress feel that it is time to consider regulations to protect consumer privacy and defend against foreign disinformation.</p><p>To that end, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), co-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, put together a white paper that contains a list of 20 proposals for regulating social media companies and those big technology companies. Senator Warner discussed those proposals in a wide-ranging interview with eWEEK.</p><p>Warner puts the issue of disinformation and misinformation at the top of his list. He's suggesting that online services have a duty to clearly and conspicuously label bots. In his interview, Warner discussed California legislation that requires letting people know when they're being contacted by a bot versus a real person. ...\"</p><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>There is an ongoing debate about what Congress and the president might do to regulate big technology companies that control the largest social media channels around the world. Just as in cybersecurity, there is pressure to \"do something,\" but different approaches are offered and different priorities exist between political parties.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is bipartisan agreement that more regulation is needed. However, it is hard to see how anything will pass before the November 2018 elections. When specific actions do occur, the \"Honest Ads Act\" seems like the most plausible place to start.</p><p>No matter who wins control of Congress in November, expect these big tech issues (as listed above in MarketWatch article) to stay near the top of the political agenda for both political parties for years, due to the social media influence in the 2018 election as well as the 2020 presidential election after that. Also, the ongoing perception (or reality) of media bias is not going away.</p><p>One thing is clear, both parties don't trust big tech to automatically \"do the right things.\" The more difficult questions, as is most often the case in Washington, D.C., are: What are the right things for these global companies to do? Will tech companies take enough steps voluntarily to satisfy Congress?</p><p>And, will these proposals become law in our partisan environment?</p><p>___ (c)2018 Emergency Management Visit Emergency Management at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emergencymgmt.com\">www.emergencymgmt.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20180909-1EM-Is-More-Tech-Regulation-Coming-0909-201809091EM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Emergency Manage KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T80-CKS1-DYNS-3087-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Emergency Management</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Emergency Management</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 9, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000984</classCode><className>JUDGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode><className>Judges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM5X</classCode><className>EU DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009TDZ</classCode><className>US FEDERAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

So is now the time to dump the technology behemoths from your portfolio?</p><p>It is the joke no stock market analyst can resist right now: Fangs are not what they used to be.</p><p>They are referring to Facebook, Amazon, Netflixand Google, collectively known as the Fang stocks (or Faang if you include Apple). It was a fitting description, because these companies have shown their teeth in recent years.</p><p>However, now it is a case of the biter bit, as they find themselves under attack on a host of different fronts.</p><p>_</p><p>Concerns about the ethical standards of social media companies have been simmering for years, with terrorist organisations using platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spread propaganda and plan attacks.</p><p>In March, these concerns exploded with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, after it emerged the company had collected the personal data of up to 87 million Facebookusers. This led to $50 billion being wiped off Facebook's market value although it has recovered slightly, notably after <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said in his testimony to Congress that it has had little \"meaningful\" impact on how many people are using the social network.</p><p>There are other threats, including a draft proposal by the European Commission to impose a 3 per cent tax on the turnover of digital giants such as Googleand Facebook, and President Donald Trump's one-man assault on retail behemoth Amazon, repeatedly tweeting that it pays too little tax, destroys jobs, and has been scamming the US Postal Service.</p><p>Every time Trump tweets, Amazon's share price falls, costing founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, $16 billion in lost stock value to date.</p><p>However, many investors also see recent dips as a buying opportunity in what has been a hugely rewarding sector.</p><p>If you invested $1,000 in Facebookwhen it floated in 2012, you would now have $4,718, according to figures from Waterstone Group.</p><p>That is a pittance compared to what Netflixhas done to $1,000 since 2002, turning it into $256,331, while the same sum invested in Chinese internet behemoth Tencent Holdings in 2004 would be worth $618,298.</p><p>Since floating back in 1980, Apple has turned $1,000 into $437,589, while this final one could you really kicking yourself. If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in 1997 your money would now be worth an incredible $972,563.</p><p>The party continued last year, when Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Googleparent Alphabet and Microsoft contributed around 40 per cent of growth on the US stock market. However, 2018 has brought the hangover.</p><p>Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at global stocks platform Interactive Investor, says each major tech company faces its own problems. \"With Facebook, it is data security. With Intel, reports that Apple will make its own chips. Tesla is repeatedly missing key targets, compounding fears about its excessive debt, while Amazon has President Trump on its case.\"</p><p>Even if you do not hold these stocks directly, your portfolio could still be in the firing line, she warns: \"The big tech companies are all held by the most popular global investment funds so you may have more exposure than you think.\"</p><p>Simon Edelsten, manager of the Mid Wynd International Investment Trust from asset managers Artemis, says when an investment phenomenon gains its own catchy acronym it is probably time to be worried \u2013 look what happened to the BRICs. \"The Fang stocks have had an outstanding few years, even accounting for recent falls. Facebook's share price has risen 100 per cent in just three years, with Googleparent Alphabet close on its heels, while Amazon has risen 300 per cent and Netflixnearer 400 per cent.\"</p><p>He says the market is now pricing in slower growth as the Cambridge Analytica scandal reduces the amount of data Facebookhas to sell, hitting advertising rates.</p><p>He has sold his fund's stake in Facebookand has offloaded Amazon despite its impressive 20 per cent a year growth rates, which he hails as \"outstanding for a company of its size\".</p><p>Amazon has conquered the US and UK but its latest target Australia could prove tricky, given vaster distances and subsequently higher delivery costs, he says. \"Amazon has a huge capital expenditure programme and will only make profits once it has taken over the world, making it hard to value. The margin of comfort has disappeared.\"</p><p>Mr Edelsten is also sceptical about Netflix, which may have disrupted the television and cinema industries and posted exceptional subscriber growth, but is yet to make a profit. \"Netflixnow look hard to value for those who believe that in the long run shares are only supported by their cash profits.\"</p><p>He is holding onto his stake in Googleparent Alphabet. \"It represents good value for money given the cash it generates and is less in the line of regulatory fire than Facebook. It has made strides cleaning up YouTube content and is engaging seriously with regulators on privacy concerns.\"</p><p>_____</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Should a China-US trade war worry UAE investors?</p><p>Should investors turn their attention to Latin America once again?</p><p>Five global indicators that tell us how the stock markets will fare this year</p><p>_____</p><p>He also retains Chinese online media giant Tencent. \"Latest figures show its income doubled last year and we suspect it has more room to keep growing in Asia than other global online businesses.\"</p><p>However, he is downbeat on the tech sector overall. \"In our view, the Fang story no longer holds as a compelling total package,\" he adds.</p><p>James Clunie, head of strategy at investment fund Jupiter Absolute Return, says a rush into \"glamour\" stocks is quite common near the end of a bull market, typically signifying late-cycle exuberance. \"The delightfully named Fangs are the poster stocks of the current cycle and potentially in a bubble.\"</p><p>We have been here before, for example, during the technology bubble in 1999, when Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and Amazon were similarly loved, Mr Clunie says. \"In the early 1970s, a group of blue-chip stocks labelled 'the nifty fifty' were seemingly invincible, until the 1973-1974 stock market crash.\"</p><p>The popularity of exchange traded funds (ETFs) has intensified the risks as money pours into passive funds tracking major US indices, Mr Clunie adds. \"In 2017 alone, an estimated $50bn was invested in S&amp;P500 Index ETFs. The launch of dedicated technology and media ETFs with roughly a third of their assets invested in Faangs is even more worrying.\"</p><p>Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says technology stock sentiment is waning amid regulatory threats, growing uncertainty over the global economy, and the prospect of a trade war between the US and China.</p><p>The key risk is a potential global recession, which history suggests could knock 30 per cent of equities, with technology unlikely to be immune. \"The probability of a recession in 2019 has gone up and equity markets may be pricing that in now.\"</p><p>Mr Garnry says Saxo is taking a more defensive approach to asset allocation, with just 23 per cent exposure to equities. \"We expect volatility and financial turmoil to increase throughout the year as this economic cycle comes to an end.\"</p><p>Alistair Jex, head of discretionary management at Coutts, is more optimistic, noting that following each recent sell-off investors have been lured back by the tech sector's resilience and diversity.</p><p>However, they must be aware of the regulatory threat, noting that taxi ride service Uber was forced to change how it operates when UK lawmakers deemed its drivers to be employees rather than self-employed. \"Uber has agreed to renegotiate contracts but the resolution is likely to complicate what started as a simple business model,\" says Mr Jex.</p><p>However, he adds that technology remains a favoured theme thanks to its impressive growth, strong earnings and their vital role in shaping the future. \"It still pushes all the right buttons for us.\"</p><p>_____</p><p>Read more:</p><p>What to buy when the stock market crashes</p><p>How will higher interest rates affect your finances in the UAE?</p><p>What Warren Buffett is really telling investors in his latest letter</p><p>_____</p><p>Tom Anderson, senior investment manager at Killik, who advises clients in Dubai, says investors should not rush to abandon big tech, as Amazon, Googleand Facebookare woven into our daily lives, for better or worse. \"However, the party is probably over for now, and recent troubles are a reminder of the need for diversification.\"</p><p>Most investors will still want some exposure to technology, especially those looking for growth. \"They should look beyond 'big tech' and have exposure to other technology themes, such as automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, but only as part of a wider set of diversified portfolio holdings.\"</p><p>Russ Mould, investment director at online trading platform AJ Bell, says while attention focuses on the FANGs and Tesla, investors should keep an eye on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or SOX, which contains 32 silicon chip designers and manufactures. \"These integrated circuits are everywhere, from smartphones to computers to cars to robots, and offer a great insight into the global economy and investor appetite for risk.\"</p><p>Upcoming results from silicon chip makers Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), could point to where the global stock market is going, Mr Mould says. \"Samsung has just got the first-quarter reporting season off to a good start, estimating that profit for the three months to March will rise 58 per cent year-on-year.\"</p><p>Investors will now be looking to Intel, TSMC and other leading SOX members such as Broadcom, Texas Instruments and Qualcomm to supply reassurance, Mr Mould adds.</p><p>Gordon Robertson, director at Investme Financial Services in Dubai, says investors must avoid falling victim to \"recency bias\", the assumption that current trends will continue. \"Is the tech party coming to an end? History suggests it has to happen at some point. However, Charles Dow, who founded the Dow Jones and Wall Street Journalist, said always assume that a trend will continue until evidence suggests otherwise.\"</p><p>The evidence right now is mixed but the growth at all costs model may to be coming to an end, as the industry matures.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/18/152380828309.JPG\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/18/152380828309.JPG</url></p><p>FacebookCEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>testifies before a joint Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees hearing last week.

Facebook has 2.4 billion active monthly users - almost a third of the planet. Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce spending in the US and generated $296bn in revenues last year - more than the entire annual economic output of Chile, Greece or Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Outside China, Google handles 92 per cent of online searches and has used its platform to expand its dominance into the markets for online advertising, shopping and travel, among others.</p><p>These are staggering figures but scale in itself is not necessarily a negative thing; far more important is the power that comes with it, and whether it is being wielded in a detrimental way.</p><p>                     But we are no longer in the era of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil, broken up by the trust-busters a century ago.</p><p>The commodity which has become the most valuable in the world is not oil but personal data. Google offers its immensely popular and undeniably useful mapping, email and search services, for free. So how can it said to be causing detriment to people who use them?</p><p>This argument only holds if we believe our personal data is worthless. The bank balances of the tech companies demonstrate that acquiring it for free and selling it on to advertisers is, in fact, enormously lucrative.</p><p>Of course, we never actually use an online service for free. Instead we make a bargain - almost always without truly thinking it through - that we will hand over information about where we are, what we've searched for, where we live, what things we buy, who we speak to, what we are worried about to a company that will sell it for profit.</p><p>Given the ubiquity of such \"free\" products, and the fallibility of human nature, can such a bargain ever be seen to be fair?</p><p>If all of our social circle uses Facebook or Instagram to connect, it becomes difficult to opt out, even if we have to hand over troves of personal information in return. The bargain, laid out over dozens of pages of terms and conditions, is a hugely lopsided one. </p><p>It is also the central element of the big tech's power. The more data they have, the more targeted their products can become and the more difficult it becomes for others to compete.</p><p>How can a rival search company provide results as good as Google's when Google has data from the vast majority of previous searches? </p><p>A far more effective approach than breaking up the tech companies, and one that is gathering more and more support, would be to properly value our data, to make companies pay for it, and to recognise that inordinate control over it is bad for us all.</p><p>Regulators should focus much more on whether or not companies are gathering more data than is strictly necessary, or using it in ways that are intrusive. </p><p>When the aim of the game is to target products at people based on thousands of pieces of information about them, curtailing the amount of data they can collect is an effective check on their power.</p><p>It would stop the hoarding of a valuable commodity, which allows a handful of companies to build an impenetrable wall around themselves.</p><p>The aim should not be to break up big tech but to even the playing field on which it competes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-64835000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-2N21-F021-6037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Because we have no other choice? No, we do have a choice.Isn't it obvious that we need an alternative economic system that isn't controlled by corporations, the government and the central bank for the exclusive benefit of insiders and elites?Isn't it obvious that the current system has failed the majority of participants, and hence the ubiquitous sensations of:1) being ignored by the insiders / elites who run the current system to their own benefit2) being trapped in an economy that's been stripped of social / upward mobility3) being stripmined / exploited by domestic and globalized elites4) disgust / frustration with the self-enriching political class that serves corporate/elite/insider interests above all else.My 50 years of work have given me a ringside seat in how the economy has changed frominclusivetoextractive.My jobs have ranged from agricultural field worker to running my own yard service to hospitality to construction to print media (free-lancer) to financial services (quant shop) to non-profit education to political rabble-rousing (unpaid) and my current profession as marginalized, misfit author-blogger (my specialty appears to be getting shadow-banned by Big Tech monopolist extractors).My colleague Mark Jeftovic explains how systems can beinclusiveorextractive. </p><p>Systems that automatically bail out the greediest, wealthiestsocially-useless speculatorsvia the Federal Reserveare not just extractive, they're exploitive and predatory.The Reversion Will be Mean[1].Extractive systems are also intrinsically fragile in crisesas the trapped / exploited behind the oars tend to abandon ship at the first chance, and the real-world sinews of the economy have been weakened by the bailouts and financial engineering. In effect, the fragile, brittle shell doesn't need much of a shock to implode. (If you want to see this process in real time, look around you.)Yes, finance was extractive in 1970, but it was a much smaller part of the economy.Back then, finance was less than 5% of the economy. Now, by some measures, it's a third of the economy.Yes, corporations bought political influence and exploited everything within reachbut their reach wasn't as global and their rapacity not quite as refined. Sociopathic exploitation such as stock buybacks and Big Pharma advertising directly to consumers were illegal.The economy was not dependent on endless asset bubbles and bailouts of the most venal speculators. The Federal Reserve whines that it has to bail out the greediest scum of the nation again and again and inflate one asset bubble after another because otherwisethis sucker's going down.Over the past 50 years, the ladders of upward mobility have splintered.Now making all the sacrifices to follow the conventional script (get a college diploma, etc.) don't lead to secure employment. The fundamental backdrop of the economy is that labor's share of the economy is in permanent decline: the value of labor has been in a freefall, a freefall masked by bogus \"low inflation\" and other trickery. (See chart below)In 1970, costs for essentials were low and regulatory burdens on small business were modest.You could rent an apartment for a week's pay or less. (Even in expensive Honolulu I could rent a studio apartment for half a week's pay.)Even in the mid-1980s, I could get a building permit for an entire house in one day; now the process takes weeks or even months.Now costs and regulatory burdens have soared to crushing levels.This plays perfectly to government bureaucracies, which have monopolies on the power to raise junk fees, penalties, etc. at will, and Corporate America, whose core drive is eliminate any and all competition so profits can soar on the basis of monopoly, not on superior products or services.People feel ignoredbecause they are ignored.People feel trappedbecause they are trapped.People feel stripminedbecause they are being stripmined. People feel angry at the political Establishmentbecause they no longer live in a democracy.Can we be honest for a change and admit that ours is an extractive system in whichanything goes for the wealthy and powerful and winners take most?The few pockets of the economy not under the thumb of corporations, government or the central bank-- for example, the cash / informal economy--are still dependent on corporations, government and the Fed for their currency, government subsidies and products/services.Isn't it obvious that we need an alternative system that isn't run for the benefit of elites and insiders?What would such a system look like?One, it would be voluntary / opt-in.Nobody would be forced to participate. All anyone would need to bring is a willingness to be useful and belong to something doing good work on behalf of the community rather than a bunch of parasitic, predatory billionaires.Two, it would be self-organizing, meaning there is no ruling body that can be corrupted. Bitcoin is a real-world example of a self-organizing system. There is no cabal at the top who can be corrupted; bitcoin isdistributedanddecentralized. It is self-organizing, as is Nature.Three, the operations of the system would be automatedso human bias would have few opportunities to carve out unearned privileges. Note that most of the systems you interact with are fully automated. (Try reaching a human being in customer service.) The only difference is these systems are secret \"black boxes\" designed to maximize the profits of cartel-monopoly corporations, not serve the nation or its communities. They only serve the owners, 2/3rds of whom just so happen to be the top 0.1%.Open-source software runs a great many enterprises and systems and does so without secret \"black box\" algorithms known only to the exploiters.Four, it would have its own money, a cryptocurrencythat comes into being in only one way: as payment for useful, purposeful labor that benefits the community in some way. All the technology for such alabor-backed cryptocurrencyis already in hand.My 50 years of work in a variety of sectors and jobs has made such a system \"obvious\" to me, and so I've written a book (A Hacker's Teleology[2])to explain how such a system would work and why it's \"obvious.\" You can read excerpts of the book in thisfree PDF[3]and readthe story behind the book and the Introduction[4].Why do we tolerate such a corrupt, undemocratic, exploitive, elite-dominated system? Because we have no other choice? No, we do have a choice.The first step to outline thevalues, processes and goalsof an alternative system that actually works for everyone and our planet.I've taken a stab at outlining such a system, so why not check it out?If you can come up with a better one, then get it out there for the rest of us to study.We do have a choice. But we have to take it.If we're unwilling to make any systemic changes, then we truly are trapped--not bythem(whomevertheymight be) but by our own unwillingness to accept that systemic change is now necessary if we're to have a future that's beneficial to all.My new book is available!A Hacker's Teleology: Sharing the Wealth of Our Shrinking Planet[5]20% and 15% discounts end September 30(Kindle $7, print $17)Read excerpts of the book for free (PDF).[6]The Story Behind the Book and the Introduction[7].

Because we have no other choice? No, we do have a choice. Isn't it obvious that we need an alternative economic system that isn't controlled by corporations, the government and the central bank for the exclusive benefit of insiders and elites? Isn't it obvious that the current system has failed the majority of participants, and hence the ubiquitous sensations of: 1) being ignored by the insiders / elites who run the current system to their own benefit 2) being trapped in an economy that's been stripped of social / upward mobility 3) being stripmined / exploited by domestic and globalized elites 4) disgust / frustration with the self-enriching political class that serves corporate/elite/insider interests above all else. My 50 years of work have given me a ringside seat in how the economy has changed from inclusive to extractive. My jobs have ranged from agricultural field worker to running my own yard service to hospitality to construction to print media (free-lancer) to financial services (quant shop) to non-profit education to political rabble-rousing (unpaid) and my current profession as marginalized, misfit author-blogger (my specialty appears to be getting shadow-banned by Big Tech monopolist extractors). My colleague Mark Jeftovic explains how systems can be inclusive or extractive. Systems that automatically bail out the greediest, wealthiest socially-useless speculators via the Federal Reserve are not just extractive, they're exploitive and predatory. The Reversion Will be Mean. Extractive systems are also intrinsically fragile in crises as the trapped / exploited behind the oars tend to abandon ship at the first chance, and the real-world sinews of the economy have been weakened by the bailouts and financial engineering. In effect, the fragile, brittle shell doesn't need much of a shock to implode. (If you want to see this process in real time, look around you.) Yes, finance was extractive in 1970, but it was a much smaller part of the economy. Back then, finance was less than 5% of the economy. Now, by some measures, it's a third of the economy. Yes, corporations bought political influence and exploited everything within reach but their reach wasn't as global and their rapacity not quite as refined. Sociopathic exploitation such as stock buybacks and Big Pharma advertising directly to consumers were illegal. The economy was not dependent on endless asset bubbles and bailouts of the most venal speculators. The Federal Reserve whines that it has to bail out the greediest scum of the nation again and again and inflate one asset bubble after another because otherwise this sucker's going down. Over the past 50 years, the ladders of upward mobility have splintered. Now making all the sacrifices to follow the conventional script (get a college diploma, etc.) don't lead to secure employment. The fundamental backdrop of the economy is that labor's share of the economy is in permanent decline: the value of labor has been in a freefall, a freefall masked by bogus \"low inflation\" and other trickery. (See chart below) In 1970, costs for essentials were low and regulatory burdens on small business were modest. You could rent an apartment for a week's pay or less. (Even in expensive Honolulu I could rent a studio apartment for half a week's pay.) Even in the mid-1980s, I could get a building permit for an entire house in one day; now the process takes weeks or even months. Now costs and regulatory burdens have soared to crushing levels. This plays perfectly to government bureaucracies, which have monopolies on the power to raise junk fees, penalties, etc. at will, and Corporate America, whose core drive is eliminate any and all competition so profits can soar on the basis of monopoly, not on superior products or services. People feel ignored because they are ignored. People feel trapped because they are trapped. People feel stripmined because they are being stripmined. People feel angry at the political Establishment because they no longer live in a democracy. Can we be honest for a change and admit that ours is an extractive system in which anything goes for the wealthy and powerful and winners take most? The few pockets of the economy not under the thumb of corporations, government or the central bank-- for example, the cash / informal economy--are still dependent on corporations, government and the Fed for their currency, government subsidies and products/services. Isn't it obvious that we need an alternative system that isn't run for the benefit of elites and insiders? What would such a system look like? One, it would be voluntary / opt-in. Nobody would be forced to participate. All anyone would need to bring is a willingness to be useful and belong to something doing good work on behalf of the community rather than a bunch of parasitic, predatory billionaires. Two, it would be self-organizing, meaning there is no ruling body that can be corrupted. Bitcoin is a real-world example of a self-organizing system. There is no cabal at the top who can be corrupted; bitcoin is distributed and decentralized. It is self-organizing, as is Nature. Three, the operations of the system would be automated so human bias would have few opportunities to carve out unearned privileges. Note that most of the systems you interact with are fully automated. (Try reaching a human being in customer service.) The only difference is these systems are secret \"black boxes\" designed to maximize the profits of cartel-monopoly corporations, not serve the nation or its communities. They only serve the owners, 2/3rds of whom just so happen to be the top 0.1%. Open-source software runs a great many enterprises and systems and does so without secret \"black box\" algorithms known only to the exploiters. Four, it would have its own money, a cryptocurrency that comes into being in only one way: as payment for useful, purposeful labor that benefits the community in some way. All the technology for such a labor-backed cryptocurrency is already in hand. My 50 years of work in a variety of sectors and jobs has made such a system \"obvious\" to me, and so I've written a book (A Hacker's Teleology) to explain how such a system would work and why it's \"obvious.\" You can read excerpts of the book in this free PDF and read the story behind the book and the Introduction. Why do we tolerate such a corrupt, undemocratic, exploitive, elite-dominated system? Because we have no other choice? No, we do have a choice. The first step to outline the values, processes and goals of an alternative system that actually works for everyone and our planet. I've taken a stab at outlining such a system, so why not check it out? If you can come up with a better one, then get it out there for the rest of us to study. We do have a choice. But we have to take it. If we're unwilling to make any systemic changes, then we truly are trapped--not by them (whomever they might be) but by our own unwillingness to accept that systemic change is now necessary if we're to have a future that's beneficial to all.

But latency and cost are taking some of the sheen off this business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Domestic payments everywhere are becoming real-time but when it comes to crossing borders, there can still be a lag of up to a few days from when a payment is initiated and when it is finally credited to the beneficiary's account.</p><p>A lack of interoperability between the payment systems of different countries is mainly at fault: When an international payment is initiated, it creates an electronic payment message that goes from the sender's bank to the receiver's bank via a central clearing authority.</p><p>If the sender or receiver uses a small local bank, then the payment will likely be routed through an intermediary bank in their respective countries. When the two countries use different payment systems and therefore different payment standards - like Eurozone (SEPA) and U.S. Dollar (Fedwire) - there is a need to change the format of the outgoing (payment) message to the format that is understood by the banking systems in the destination country. This slows down the payment cycle and also makes it more complex.</p><p>If all the payment systems in the world were to adopt the same messaging standard, it would bring much-needed interoperability to cross-border payments, resulting in faster, cheaper and more accurate transactions.</p><p>ISO 20022 is such a standard. By standardizing the fields used to process a payment and the labels for each field, ISO 20022 enables all computer systems involved in cross-border payments to work together seamlessly. Thanks to its rich text format, ISO 20022 accommodates a variety of payment-related information that it passes on to the destination system (also on the same standard) without any data loss.</p><p>Adopted in several parts of the world, including the Eurozone, Australia, Canada, Singapore and India, ISO 20022 has attained the critical mass required by a global standard. This adoption is an ongoing process. SWIFT is gradually retiring their proprietary MT standards in favor of ISO 20022, which will go live in 2022. TARGET2, EURO1 and the Bank of England RTGS renewal are some of the other initiatives on the road to adoption.</p><p>With hundreds of fields, the ISO 20022 standard applies to many types of financial messaging, besides payments. For example, it is possible to use it with a cash management statement so that when a payment message is received, its data can provide a corporate user with all the relevant details about currency, country of origination, purpose, instrument of payment, etc. The company can analyze this rich data to streamline their processes in the future and also to improve fraud prevention, innovation, decision-making, etc.</p><p>What's more, the scope of ISO 20022 is not limited to interbank payment systems; it is mandated for use by PSD2 payment initiation APIs as well. This is improving interoperability in open banking transactions from end to end - from when a consumer authorizes a payment on a smartphone until it gets credited to the beneficiary's account seconds later.</p><p>Because ISO 20022 makes it possible to layer fintech services on top of a payment system, new initiatives - such as P27, for instant multi-currency payments between the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden - are being built on this standard. Other benefits of ISO 20022 include resilience and flexibility, as it's more responsive to market changes and stimuli.</p><p>Regulatory mandates apart, a key driver of new payment scheme adoption by the banking community is in response to the plans of big tech companies to offer cross-border, real time payments through their platforms in the future (for example, what Facebook envisions with Libra). Fearing large-scale competition, banks are accelerating their programs to enable instant and low-cost movement of money across borders.</p><p>Adopting a universal payments standard, however, has its challenges. While a domestic standard can be put in place quickly by building consensus among the banks in the country, a cross-border payments standard needs agreement between different nations with different priorities. It is easier to enforce this standard through a central body, such as SWIFT, rather than getting all the participants to agree.</p><p>Of course, this means that some countries would have to compromise, most likely the smaller ones, which cannot risk isolation from the international market. On the other hand, large countries with huge and profitable domestic markets, such as the U.S., could choose to set their own agendas and timelines for coming on board.</p><p>The flexibility of ISO 20022 means that there are small variations in the standard itself as it is applied in different countries. The markets that have adopted it, such as Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, etc., are using ISO 20022 with small variations and it will take a bit of effort on everyone's part to get to full interoperability.</p><p>As with so many other things, Covid-19 has pushed back rollout by a year or so in some markets. That being said, the delay is giving banking systems a bit more time to weed out glitches and is allowing more countries to go live at the same time, thereby minimizing the risk of problems in interoperability.</p><p>One way that banks can ensure a smooth cutover is by implementing a core banking / payment solution that uses ISO 20022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-000001739291d095afff9ff5120100011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-7KR1-JCRW-53HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The initiative - headed by former Google executive Tania Aidrus - has the agenda to increase access and connectivity, enhance digital education and introduce a new era of e-governance in Pakistan.</p><p>'Pakistan's tech ecosystem has been slowly gaining momentum in the last few years. It's home to a strong tech talent base and it's still competitively affordable, which makes it ideal for early-stage founders like myself,' Hena Husain, founder of London-based communications startup The Content Architects was quoted by DW as saying. According to Hena, the growth in Karachi's tech market is increasing by the day. The Content Architects work with a development team based in Karachi.</p><p>According to DW, confidence in Pakistan's tech market has led to an increase in the availability of local capital.</p><p>'While Pakistan's startup scene and venture capital market is still relatively new, the number of funds - such as i2i Ventures and Fatima Gobi Ventures - and active angel investors have increased significantly since 2018, DW said.</p><p>While trying to find out where Pakistan's tech revolution has sprung out from, DW quoted Iskander Pataudi - a Pakistani-born tech professional working in Berlin - as saying that the tech scene in the country evolved organically.</p><p>'A few Pakistani tech startups have raised huge funding rounds at a time where our economy is just keeping its head above water,' he was quoted as saying. 'This makes sense, considering we have a huge market of young, digitally-savvy consumers and increased 3G and 4G connectivity.'</p><p>Quoting Rabeel Warraich - founder of Pakistan-based venture capital fund Sarmayacar - DW said that a string of startup success stories, combined with a more stable political landscape under \u2026 Imran Khan, has increased 'investors' confidence that Pakistan holds huge potential for exiting businesses.'</p><p>According to DW, Pakistani nationals living overseas are beginning to believe that new avenues of opportunity are opening up back home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STAMAN-STAT010220200008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STAMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3Y-1YH1-F00C-64YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381881</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mashriq Group of Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Statesman (AsiaNet)</publicationName><volume>Vol. 22</volume><issueNumber>No. 32</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp;

But as companies and governments enlist sophisticated tracking technology from biometrics to Bluetooth as a weapon against the coronavirus, privacy implications are coming back into focus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tracing apps have become a popular option for citizens and governments to monitor the spread of the virus\u2014but they also open new avenues for unparalleled access to user data. As of May 8, 2020, 5.3 million Australians had downloaded COVIDSafe, an app backed by the government that uses Bluetooth to exchange a \"digital handshake\" with any other user who comes within five feet, and pushes an alert if they have contact with anyone who tests positive for COVID-19. The UK's National Health Service is currently piloting a similar app, in which several security issues have already been flagged.</p><p>Some governments are taking more aggressive measures, turning national defense software on their citizens in an effort to contain the virus. The Israeli internal security office redeployed counter-terrorism technology to track the movement of COVID-19 patients using phone and credit card data. In Russia, authorities used facial recognition software to locate a woman who had \"escaped\" from quarantine. In South Korean train stations, thermal cameras monitor travelers' body temperatures. Drones in the United Kingdom have spotted and reported people violating social distancing regulations. The Australian government is installing surveillance hardware in some homes to ensure that anyone in quarantine stays put\u2014with the threat of fines or jail time if they don't.</p><p>Citizens are expressing qualms about the use of tracing tools. Only 37% of Americans think it's acceptable for the government to use cellphone data to track individuals in order to ensure they are complying with social distancing regulations, only 45% think it's acceptable to track those who may have had contact with someone who tested positive, and just over half (52%) think it's acceptable to track the movements of people who have tested positive, according to April 2020 findings from Pew Research.</p><p>Perhaps adding to these reservations, many of the Big Tech companies who were major culprits in data and privacy breaches are also developing tracing technology. On May 20, Apple and Google\u2014two companies that were under significant fire for data harvesting\u2014released their joint Exposure Notification API software, which supports the development of contact-tracing apps. While not itself a tracing app, as was originally planned, it lays the technical foundation for developers to build upon in the creation of their own apps. The companies report that twenty-two countries across five continents have already requested the API to support their app development. Facebook, meanwhile, is sharing location data with COVID-19 researchers to track and predict hotspots.</p><p>Less obvious, seemingly innocuous platforms are also coming under scrutiny for privacy concerns. The New York City Department of Education banned the video-conferencing app Zoom from school use after the FBI warned that it was susceptible to digital hacking. Other free applications, such as Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger, are raising similar concerns. Google subsidiary Verily requires a Google account to locate and book coronavirus testing\u2014and says it may share users' personal health information with outside parties like contractors and the government.</p><p>Privacy advocates argue that the use of tools like locating testing centers, videoconferencing and chat apps is no longer truly voluntary in newly distanced lifestyles. With schools and offices closed, many people don't have any choice about logging onto Zoom for classes or meetings. And linking to your Google account seems a small price to pay to arrange testing. As The New York Times' editorial board wrote in an April 7 opinion piece, \"many Americans now rely on digital tools to work remotely and stay connected. They shouldn't have to sacrifice their privacy to use them.\"</p><p>Especially because, as Senator Maria Cantwell expressed during an April 9th hearing on the role of Big Tech during the pandemic, \"rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.\" Many of the far-reaching powers granted to intelligence officials after 9/11, for example, are still in place nearly two decades later.</p><p>And yet, the undeniable omnipotence that makes personal data a threat to individual privacy is also what makes it a major asset in managing public health. It is an incredibly powerful resource, with enormous capabilities for good alongside its vulnerabilities. \"In this particular case, if we have technology for minimizing harm, we have a moral obligation to use it,\" Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, told the New Yorker. \"But we have to merge it with the best available technology in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy.\"</p><p>Initiatives to regulate data in the era of COVID-19 are starting to emerge. At the end of April, U.S. senators proposed a privacy bill for COVID-19 contact tracing, while earlier in the month hundreds of academics around the world signed their names in support of privacy-friendly contact tracing apps.</p><p>Consumers and experts alike are still grappling with where to draw the line between public health and personal privacy. But one thing is clear: the stakes of the data privacy debate are higher than ever. \"It's important to consider,\" Northeastern University professor of computer science and law Woodrow Hartzog said in May during a conversation about privacy and COVID-19, \"that the decisions we make now will impact privacy for years to come.\"</p><p>Source: Wunderman Thompson</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/31/159047570896.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/31/159047570896.jpg</url></p><p> Is privacy being sacrificed in the global fight against COVID-19?<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/79/159047571173.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/79/159047571173.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/10/159047571460.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/10/159047571460.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/82/159047571719.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/82/159047571719.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/6/159047571878.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/6/159047571878.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/18/159047572178.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/18/159047572178.png</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MDAVME-175380256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MDAVME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600D-8GN1-JDJN-6243-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 World of Media JLT Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Soon the streets would be filled with self-driving cars, using high-quality cameras to navigate. What if those cameras could also be trained to recognise licence plates and spot traffic offences? It would be like having a hyper-efficient traffic cop on every corner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still pulling people over for traffic violations and writing them tickets,\u201d says Carson. \u201cThat\u2019s so 20 years ago.\u201d</p><p>Carson\u2019s start-up, Hayden AI, is now trying to create a network of eyes many times any CCTV network, supercharged by 5G mobile networks and artificial intelligence. The images could come from almost anywhere: taxi drivers could place a smartphone on their dashboards; if the footage resulted in another motorist receiving a parking fine, the taxi driver could receive a share of the proceeds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea \u2014 to put as many eyes on the road as possible,\u201d enthuses Carson. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to create a large paradigm shift in behaviour.\u201d Once this unprecedented network of intelligent cameras exists, there is no reason why it should stop with identifying traffic violations. The footage could help solve any crime, inform city planning and target advertising.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to be a Luddite to feel that something fundamental is changing in the human experience. We are becoming known entities. It is not simply that information is being collected on us; that information is now often high-quality video and audio, which can precisely identify our every move.\u00a0</p><p>Across the US, police forces have been giving out Amazon\u2019s smart doorbells, which film the surrounding street. Some of the footage is then streamed on an app, Neighbors. The days of private investigators sitting in cars could be over: now they can just park the car with a camera on the dashboard, and watch the footage from their living room.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, employers can track our sleeping habits, retailers can follow us round the aisles, car parts suppliers say that they can identify drivers\u2019 emotions. The resulting data are training complex algorithms, which then nudge us towards certain behaviours. \u201cWe are moving from a digital age to an age of prediction,\u201d says Pam Dixon, director of the World Privacy Forum, a think-tank.</p><p>Your smartphone aspires to know what you want before you do. I recently met a tech entrepreneur who couldn\u2019t work out why Google Maps was suggesting that he visit a certain location. Then he realised it was time for his six-weekly haircut. At least it was only a suggestion.</p><p>How do we deal with this new world? In 2010, when he was chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt said that the company\u2019s policy was \u201cto get right up to the creepy line and not cross it\u201d. He added brain implants were beyond the creepy line \u201cat least for the moment, until the technology gets better\u201d. It remains one of the best summaries of how we deal with technologies: the creepy line exists, the creepy line shifts.</p><p>Twenty years ago, if a supermarket had asked to put a microphone in our houses, or a landlord had asked to put in a camera, or a train company had asked our whereabouts in the station, we would have said no. Now we buy Amazon Alexas, rent Airbnbs and use\u00a0 London Underground\u2019s free WiFi. And then we cross our fingers. Amazon and Google now both admit that individual employees listen to some recordings from their smart speakers. Facebook argues that its users have no expectation of privacy on their posts.</p><p>This has set up a confrontation. On one side are those who are trying to make the creepy line into an uncrossable trench. In May the city of San Francisco banned its police from using facial recognition software \u2014 a move intended to nip the technology in the bud. This month a new email service called Superhuman disabled the ability for users to track where and when a recipient had opened their message \u2014 following online outcry.</p><p>On the other side are those intent on pushing the creepy line back, by accustoming people to new technologies. This includes Carson, the computer scientist planning a surveillance network. \u201cIf we can live in a society where you can walk safely down an alley, I think that creepy line goes away,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Google has learnt the lesson of Google Glass, the wearable camera launched in 2013 that was shunned by citizens. It is introducing facial recognition in a deliberately timid manner \u2014 as a quick way to log in to its home assistant.</p><p>Historically you could expect privacy in a phone-box or with a doctor. But what kind of privacy can you expect from a cellphone provider or a fitness watch? We don\u2019t know enough to have expectations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In 1998, while Google was based</emphasis> in a garage and Kodak still dominated the camera market, the science fiction writer David Brin predicted the end of privacy as we knew it. Brin argued that cameras and sensors were becoming so cheap that they would inevitably become omnipresent.\u00a0</p><p>People\u2019s actions would be recorded, their tax returns published. But this, Brin argued, would create a new form of privacy. \u201cMutually assured surveillance\u201d would ensure that people did not misbehave \u2014 that each citizen was let alone. There would be no more hit-and-run drivers or political corruption.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was fun while it lasted, living on these city streets amid countless, nameless fellow beings,\u201d Brin wrote in his book\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Transparent Society</emphasis>. \u201cIt was also lonely.\u201d Anonymity was just a phase in human existence, whose end was now inevitable. After all, what would anonymity have meant to a cave dweller? What privacy did Victorian teenagers have from their parents?\u00a0</p><p>Brin believes that his vision is coming true \u2014 that \u201cgodlike powers of almost omniscient vision and surveillance\u201d are spreading. This is not limited to the powerful. Police malpractice is now caught on camera. In the US, family-history websites, to which millions of people submitted DNA samples out of idle curiosity, are being used to identify suspects (the first successful prosecution took place in Washington state last month).</p><p>There is also another argument that surveillance is inevitable. In China, surveillance is becoming pervasive, and algorithms score citizens on their behaviour. If the west enacts privacy laws, it will have less data \u2014 a key raw material for artificial intelligence \u2014 and so will put itself at a competitive disadvantage. Democracies will have to collect data in order to safeguard themselves from cyber attacks, or so the argument goes.\u00a0</p><p>The head of the Metropolitan Police\u2019s staff association recently called China\u2019s use of facial recognition \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d. For most of us, however, total transparency or surveillance would be a dystopia. We fear data breaches, identity theft and simply the embarrassment of old photos online, but it often takes bitter experience for us to act. \u201cPrivacy\u2019s a hindsight problem \u2014 you look back and see what\u2019s happened,\u201d says Jason Schultz, a law professor at New York University.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t help that privacy is a slippery, abstract concept. It is not mentioned explicitly in the US constitution or in English law before a few decades ago. Its essence is that it is contextual: we want certain information limited to certain people. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to share a secret with a stranger, who will never be able to connect it with any other information about you? Privacy is also often about power: the less knowledge that others have about you, the less easily they can meddle in your life. Total transparency would not satisfy either of these criteria.\u00a0</p><p>Big technology companies have different approaches to addressing our worries. First, they can build in some privacy: Apple, a pioneer, blocks some online tracking (its chief executive Tim Cook said last year that \u201cstockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them\u201d). Facebook, a privacy laggard, now predicts that the \u201cmain ways\u201d that people will communicate on its platform will be via encrypted messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp.\u00a0</p><p>Second, tech companies offer to put us in control. Google and Apple now offer more options to hide our location, for example. On a cloudless day in Silicon Valley in May, I listened as a Google executive noted how much personal information was now stored on our phones. \u201cYou should always be in control of what you share and who you share it with,\u201d she said. Facebook promises that users\u2019 information \u201cwill only be seen by who they want to see it\u201d. In other words, we can now choose where to put the creepy line.\u00a0</p><p>The third way that technology companies offer us privacy is by safeguarding and anonymising our data. Google will know you searched for gonorrhoea remedies and went to the cinema on a sick day, but no one else will. Likewise, so what if an Amazon employee who you never meet listens to a recording of your domestic life? The risk that anonymised data will be traced back to individuals can never be eliminated \u2014 especially because new data sets might become available that can be crossmatched \u2014 but it can be made minimal.</p><p>There are, however, notable flaws in this vision. Facebook and Google have to keep tracking us, because that is what their advertising business is built on. They can offer consent without offering real choice. Today less than 10 per cent \u2014 probably closer to 1 per cent \u2014 of Google users change their privacy settings. With many companies\u2019 services, you either sign up to a sweeping statement, or you can\u2019t use the service at all. Nearly all the time, we don\u2019t know what it means to click \u201caccept\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen you go to your doctor, they don\u2019t just say, I can perform any kind of surgery you want if you sign this form,\u201d says Schultz of New York University. In the current world, we are like drugged patients, who submit ourselves a general anaesthetic, knowing our bodies will be used for medical research while we\u2019re unconscious.\u00a0</p><p>In the future, individuals could be given more detail about the use of their data; an option to deny apps access to key information and still use the service; and easier means to delete their data after the fact.\u00a0</p><p>But perhaps we should go further still, and say that even informed consent does not guarantee privacy. Governments don\u2019t allow us to save money by buying a car without seat belts, or to make money by selling our organs. Does privacy belong in the same category as safety or medical ethics? If some degree of privacy is a right \u2014 an essential part of being human, rather than a commodity \u2014 then we should not be able to trade it away either. \u201cIt is a classic consumer protection problem,\u201d said Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s Internet Institute.</p><p>The principle of individual agency \u2014 Google\u2019s promise that \u201cYou should always be in control\u201d \u2014 has other limitations. How does it apply to surveillance in public places: such as facial recognition by the police or even from other people\u2019s smart cars? You can\u2019t sign a form every time you leave the house. And even if we as individuals opt out, our behaviour can be inferred through the huge datasets on other people\u2019s behaviour.</p><p>This is the new frontier: to protect our own privacy from intrusive algorithms, we may need to block collection of other people\u2019s data and therefore slow down services that they might find useful. How do we find the balance?\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quayside is a four-hectare</emphasis>, former industrial stretch of Toronto\u2019s eastern waterfront. One of Google\u2019s sister companies wants to turn it into \u201cthe most innovative district in the world\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>In a proposal published last month, Sidewalk Labs outlined a vision of the future. As always with Silicon Valley dreams, there is something to love. The buildings would nearly all be made of wood; they would be able to turn food waste into energy; the greenhouse gas emissions would be barely a tenth of the current city average.\u00a0</p><p>At the heart of Sidewalk Labs\u2019 vision is data. Sensors would gather information in buildings and adjust settings. The thermostats could be adjusted automatically. The street markings could fluctuate, giving more room to pedestrians at some times in the day and more to cars at others. Data would be made publicly accessible for other public goods \u2014 not advertising. People\u2019s lives would be tracked, measured and \u201coptimised\u201d. And as in a Kafka novel or the TV show\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Mirror</emphasis>, residents might feel subject to opaque processes beyond their direct control.</p><p>Many services swap marginal intrusion for a marginal benefit (a meal ordering app recently asked me for a photo to make it easier for me to collect my order). Sidewalk Labs is promising significant intrusion for a significant benefit. As such, it is comparable to the healthcare services that want access to sensitive data \u2014 in exchange for helping to identify serious disease.\u00a0</p><p>The fate of Sidewalk Toronto is interesting, because it is a rare example where technology companies have had to submit their innovation for inspection beforehand. Critics have centred on how Quayside\u2019s data will be handled. A trust, proposed by Sidewalk Labs, recommends all data gathered is de-identified. But it would not insist upon it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs soon as they said that, I knew I had to resign,\u201d says Ann Cavoukian, a former Ontario privacy commissioner, who was an adviser to the company last year. \u201cThe minute you make it voluntary, you\u2019re not going to have any privacy. Everybody wants personally identifiable data, that\u2019s the treasure trove.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cavoukian compares it to the surveillance in China and Dubai. \u201cNo way, that\u2019s not the direction we\u2019re going to here in Toronto.\u201d She adds that privacy concerns could yet lead Waterfront Toronto, the development agency, to cancel the whole thing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a done deal,\u201d she says.</p><p>But\u00a0 Waterfront Toronto and the city\u2019s citizens are faced with an almost impossible decision: to evaluate unforeseeable benefits against unforeseeable costs. Who knows how massive, but probably de-identified, data collection will affect Toronto? Who knew how YouTube, Facebook and Twitter would affect the world?</p><p>In any case, nobody seriously thinks that tech companies will have less data on us in 10 years than they do today. We can ban police use of facial recognition, but the technology is likely to spread in other places \u2014 as will gait recognition, iris scanning and biometrics. (The US Department of Homeland Security aims for nearly all air travellers to be boarded using facial recognition by 2023.) Woodrow Hartzog, a privacy scholar, argues that there is a value in simply making data harder to collect, in creating transaction costs. But parents use cameras to watch their children, homeowners use them to watch their front doors; the shift from convenience to surveillance is an easy one.</p><p>When regulation has focused on particular areas, as with an Illinois law on biometrics, it has proved effective. Information may be the new oil, but for some start-ups, it\u2019s also known as \u201cthe new Kryptonite\u201d, because of the fines for data breaches.\u00a0</p><p>Politicians like to talk about \u201ccomprehensive\u201d privacy legislation. Yet, privacy is so contextual that each sector needs different standards, says Dixon of the World Privacy Forum. The AI Now Institute, a think-tank working on holding algorithms to account, argues that different bodies should be set up with expertise in different sectors: healthcare, education, welfare and so on.\u00a0</p><p>There is not one creepy line, there are hundreds. \u201cYou should always be in control of what you share and who you share it with,\u201d says Google. But after nearly two decades living in the data economy, we have learnt that perhaps the best way to draw those creepy lines is not as individuals, hurrying through online consent forms, but as communities, with the power of numbers. For 20 years, tech companies have assumed that they are right to infringe our privacy; we should now ask them to justify themselves first.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Henry Mance is the FT\u2019s chief feature writer</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What forms of surveillance would you find unacceptable?

Not only did they have a former cable lobbyist as head of the Federal Communications Commission, but he was even planning to push through\u00a0a new proposal that would have given them the power to create separate Internet fast lanes[1] where they could\u00a0charge more to Internet[2] companies to ensure their traffic got delivered faster. And to top it all off, many of them were planning to engage in a huge wave of mergers that would give them even more power over the broadband and/or pay TV markets, from Comcast-Time Warner Cable to Sprint-T-Mobile to ATT-DirecTV.</p><p><br/> But alas for them, it seems that America's ISPs have finally overreached. FCC chairman Wheeler's proposal to allow for Internet fast lanes has created an enormous\u00a0backlash[3] not just from net neutrality advocates but also from major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook[4], as well as major Silicon Valley venture capitalists and popular entertainers ranging from Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder to actor Mark Ruffalo to director Oliver Stone.<br/> Emboldened by this backlash, net neutrality advocates have started banging the drum to get the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as telecom companies, which would let the commission enforce strong net neutrality rules that would make ISPs keep the Internet a level playing field where both big tech companies and small startups would all get the same treatment when it comes to traffic prioritization.<br/> This has unsurprisingly completely freaked out American ISPs, which is why many of their CEOs have just sent a letter to the FCC warning them of all the horrible, terrible, scary things that will happen if they get reclassified as telecom companies. In fact, the ISPs say that 'even the potential threat of Title II [reclassification] had an investment-chilling effect by erasing approximately ten percent of some ISPs' market cap in the days immediately surrounding' the FCC's original attempt to reclassify ISPs as telecom companies, which the commission backed down on under heavy industry pressure. The ISPs also warn that 'such an action would greatly distort the future development of, and investment in, tomorrow's broadband networks and services.'<br/> What makes this last 'threat' particularly hilarious is that ISPs have already started slowing down their investments in network upgrades even without being reclassified as telecom carriers. As Vox's Matt Yglesias notes[5], the\u00a0National Cable Telecommunications Association's own data shows that average annual broadband investment peaked in the period from 2005 through 2008 but has declined since then to levels that are just above the average annual investment we saw between 2001 and 2004 \u2014 and that's without even adjusting for inflation.<br/> 'The industry is acting like a low-competition industry, scaling back investment and plowing its profits into dividends and share buybacks and merger efforts,' Yglesias concludes.<br/> And this is where American ISPs' business practices over the last decade or so are really going to come back to bite them. While Comcast, Time Warner Cable, ATT and Verizon are able to influence lawmakers with millions in lobbying dollars, there is no way that they're going to rally\u00a0the general public to their side, especially when well-loved companies such as Netflix and Amazon are pushing back against them.<br/> While I'd still rate it highly unlikely that ISPs will actually get reclassified as telecom carriers, I also think it's even more unlikely at this point that the FCC will hand them the power to fracture the Internet into fast and slow lanes. The days when ISPs could\u00a0get whatever they want just by greasing lawmakers' and regulators' palms\u00a0appear to be over.

Palestinian health officials say that six people have been killed in Israeli air strikes. Israel says it launched the strikes as militants fired rockets and mortars into Israel. Hamas has fired more than 400 rockets since Monday, killing one man inside Israel, the first person killed in the country from rockets since 2014 war.</p><p>The escalation began following a botched Israeli undercover raid inside Gaza. This is the worse surge of violence between the two sides in four years.</p><p>CNN's Oren Lieberman is near the border in Sderot, Israel. He joins us now. And Oren, we have seen this major escalation and violence. What's the latest t border?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, just moments ago, actually right now, we're hearing explosions that might be either from rockets that were fired as we did get some red alerts indicating rocket or mortar fire or perhaps iron dome interceptions. We've seen -- we've heard a number of those and we've gotten those red alerts indicating of continued rocket fire over the course of the last hour.</p><p>As you point out, the Israeli military says more than 400 rockets have been fired. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has itself from the air and the ground carried out more than a hundred strikes against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad military targets inside of Gaza.</p><p>That being said, even with what we just heard a few moments ago, this is not the same phrenetic (ph) pace as we saw last night and early this morning. In fact, here in Sderot, we're on the Gaza border. We're talking to some of the people standing right next to us and they say they haven't heard a red alarm here in Sderot since 6 o'clock in the morning. So, it's difficult to say where things stand right now, but again this is not the same hectic phrenetic (ph) pace of barrages of rockets and series of air strikes that we saw last night.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah. No red alert, but no -- what are the prospects for a cease-fire at this point?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Well, we know from yesterday that Egypt and the United Nations entered the picture here fairly quickly to try to bring both sides together or rather keep them apart, keep them from getting to the edge of a war and beginning a war. We've seen those two groups that is Egypt and the U.N. successfully sort of mediate in the past and pull both sides back from the edge in some of the sharp escalations we've seen over the past few months.</p><p>That being said, even if they're involved here, we did talk to one senior international official who a few hours ago said he was pessimistic. One of the key questions here is what happens in the next hour, Kristie. It was right at sunset, which is about an hour away, that everything got serious in terms of rocket fire and anti-tank missile fired from Gaza at a bus near the Gaza periphery yesterday. We'll see if darkness brings more rocket fire and that, of course, will mean more strikes in Gaza.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah. So, what happens next? You'll be monitoring that from the border. But what led us to this moment of current hostilities between these two sides? It goes back to this Israeli special ops operation of the weekend that went awry. What happened and what was its objective?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It does. And it's worth pointing out that the weekend before that, the Friday and Saturday before that, was one of the quietest we've seen along the Gaza border of the course of the last half year. That after Qatar sent in $15 million to try to ease some of the tensions here.</p><p>But on Sunday night, there is an Israeli special forces operation inside of Gaza. According to the Qassam Brigades, the Hamas military wing, that special forces raid was uncovered or discovered somehow. In the escalation of hostilities that followed, one Israeli officer was killed, a high ranking lieutenant colonel, as well a Hamas military commander and six other Palestinians.</p><p>There was then a lull on Monday morning, a period of calm for a few hours. And then Monday afternoon, that's when we've entered what we're seeing now, an anti-tank missile hits a Israeli bus in the Gaza periphery seriously wounding one. That then leads to rocket fire. Palestinian militant groups inside of Gaza saying that's a response to the special forces raid. And then the ensuing Israeli strikes across Gaza that have continued up until this point.</p><p>Again, Kristie, we'll see where all these stands. It's not at the same pace as we saw it last night. But that doesn't mean we can't get there very quickly once again.</p><p>LU STOUT: Oren Lieberman, reporting live for us, thank you. Now, there are chilling new claims about the murder of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>[08:04:58] The \"New York Times\" says there is an audio recording of his killing and in it a member of the so-called hit squad says the words, quote, \"tell your boss.\" They were told over the phone. And U.S. officials, as cited by the \"New York Times,\" thinks that boss could refer to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia has long denied any knowledge of the operation.</p><p>Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul. She joins us now. And Jomana, yet another revelation in this ongoing drift feed of leaks, but does this draw a line to the Saudi crown prince himself?</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, at this time really, Kristie, it is coming from Washington. As you mentioned there, this recording is from the \"New York Times.\" They say they've spoken to three people who are familiar with the audio recording of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. And in this recording, they say that shortly after the journalist was murdered inside the consulate, a phone call was made from one of the 15 Saudis who was part of hit squad that was sent to Istanbul and he made a call to a superior in which he says, quote, \"tell your boss,\" something along the lines of the deed is done.</p><p>Now, this individual who made phone call according to the \"New York Times\" is Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb. CNN has reported on him in the past month or so. He is a former diplomat at the embassy in London. He is a security official and intelligence officer. He is within the inner circle of the crown prince.</p><p>But during that call, there is no mention of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by name. But intelligence officials in the U.S. believed that that term, your boss, refers to the crown prince. And we know from several U.S. officials, Kristie, over the last several weeks saying that they believe an operation like this that involves members of the inner circle would not have happened without the direct knowledge of the young crown prince.</p><p>The Saudis have repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge of this, that he had anything to do with this, and they blamed it on rogue elements. And when it with comes specifically to this \"New York Times\" reporting, they provided the newspaper with a statement going also as far as saying that even that part of the recording doesn't exist. They say that Saudi officials listened to it and they did not hear that part.</p><p>But again, there could be -- we could be talking about different recordings. We could talk about Turkey basically providing various recordings to the different governments, different countries, different agencies. And some in the intelligence community believe this is as close as it's going to get to a smoking gun that links MBS to the killing of Khashoggi.</p><p>But what this does for sure is that it adds more pressure, not only on Saudi Arabia, Kristie, but also the United States and other western countries that have been provided with this audio of the killing to really put pressure on the Saudis for answers. The most important question Turkey has been seeking the answer to is who ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>LU STOUT: And the revelations, they just keep on coming. Jomana Karadsheh, reporting live for us from Istanbul. Jomana, thank you.</p><p>And now to California where officials continue to battle multiple wildfires, one of which is now the deadliest in the state's history. In northern California, a massive fire has killed at least 42 people and burned through more than a hundred thousand acres. It is believed to be only 30 percent contained. And to the south, another fire is expected to intensify today due to high wind. At least two with people have been killed in that blaze. State regulators are now investigating two utility companies that reported incidence close in time and location to the start of both fires.</p><p>Let's bring in Dan Simon. He is on the scene for us in Paradise, California. And Dan, the campfire you've been reporting on, it is now officially the deadliest wildfire in California history. Is it still very active and very much on the move?</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kristie. First of all, there was a concern at the very beginning of this fire that there was going to be a high death toll given the fact that it really spreads so fast and that you have a lot of elderly retirees who live in this community. We know that today the focus is going to be on continuing to possibly find more bodies.</p><p>They're bringing in 150 or so more crews. There will be cadaver dogs out looking for more bodies. And you also have the gruesome task of trying to identify them. Keep in mind, many if not most of them are so badly burned that they cannot be identified. So they are asking family members whom they suspect may have lost love ones to provide a DNA sample so ultimately these bodies can be identified.</p><p>In the meantime, Kristie, let me explain where I am real quick. You can see these shopping carts. This is something pretty much everybody can identify with. We're in front of what was a grocery store, completely burned out. That just underscores just how much has been lost in this fire.</p><p>[08:10:05] And I also just want to tell you a little bit about how -- where things stand. We're talking about 117,000 acres. The growth has been modest in the last couple of days. So, that is good news. And the containment number has gone up. The bad news is there is no rain in the forecast. Things remain really dry. And so the threat persists for more fires in the area. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And as the families wait for answers, we know there is this grim and delicate task under way to identify the remains that are being discovered. How are the families coping as they wait for any update about their loved ones?</p><p>SIMON: It's very difficult. You have some 52,000 in the broader community who have been evacuated and were just trying to get through day by day. And I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people, they really aren't quite sure if they're ever going to come back to Paradise. Keep in mind it's going to be weeks -- it's going to be weeks before residents are allowed back in. And that's just to go through and just sort of pick through the rubble and try to, you know, find anything in your burned out house.</p><p>But in terms of when people will be living here again, I mean, who knows when that is going to be. You know, you have houses and restaurants and schools and churches and a whole infrastructure that has been destroyed. So this is going to take many years for the town of Paradise to come back, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah. People want to pick up the pieces of their lives, their homes. But what has been spared? What is left there in what looks like a wasteland behind you?</p><p>Dan Simon reporting live for us from Paradise, California. Dan, thank you.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still right here on the program, Captain America is bowing his head. The Punisher lays down his arms. The Avengers assemble in grief. And somewhere out there, the Marvel universe is mourning the death of the man who created it. We remember Stan Lee.</p><p>LU STOUT: It is Tuesday night here in Hong Kong. Welcome back. You're watching \"News Stream.\" Now, the world largest aviation data breach is even worse than customers originally thought. Cathay Pacific now says it knew of a massive cyberattack on its systems for months and was busy looking out for other possible attacks before making any public statements.</p><p>Hong Kong's flagship airline says it took immediate action when it first discovered the attack in March. So, why did it take so long to speak up about it? Well, the airline says it was on alert for more intrusions and wanted to give, quote, \"a single accurate and meaningful notification to each passenger affected.\"</p><p>Now, more than 9 million people have been affected by the massive data breach. Now, from Facebook's enormous data leak to global employee walkouts at Google for handling of sexual misconduct cases, it has been a challenging year for big tech.</p><p>[08:15:08] In a wide ranging interview, Samuel Burke sat down with the co- founder of Reddit to talk about some of these hot (ph) issues that the tech industry is grappling with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, REDDIT CO-FOUNDER: We absolutely need to curve the radicalized behavior. I don't think -- I think any reasonable person agrees that that is not healthy.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Hate speech, harassment, how can that be allowed?</p><p>OHANIAN: Harassment has been banned on the site basically since I came back about three, four years ago. The gray area is in this like sort of antisocial, unpopular rhetoric and the challenge is -- I mean it's literally coming from the president of the United States, literally a tweet from the president is in many ways pretty reprehensible and that's a front page story on Reddit.</p><p>BURKE: Facebook has spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to police around elections, for fake news.</p><p>OHANIAN: Oh, yeah.</p><p>BURKE: Do you think that they've done enough?</p><p>OHANIAN: I don't think the job had will ever be done. You can have teams of thousands of people filling thousands of war rooms, but they still can't keep up with hundreds of millions of connected people. But I think this is where if AI and machine learning can do something really effectively, it's to build better tools for the real time enforcement of what they're trying to do. And whether that's from within Facebook or someone else who is selling it to Facebook, I think that's the next frontier.</p><p>BURKE: Did it surprise you when you found out that Google paid millions of dollars in exit packages to people accused of sexual harassment?</p><p>OHANIAN: Did it surprise me? No. In the wake of Me Too, one of the most striking things was the structural malice that has been in place. I do not expect this to be over. The system still feels like there's too much left clogging it up. What will truly change things is when you see more women who are getting the chance to get into positions of power that we start to see a real sort of gender equality in the industry, but we are still a very long way away from that.</p><p>BURKE: What do you look for in companies you're investing in?</p><p>OHANIAN: We want those founders to be relentless. We want to know that they are not going to quit, but they've probably obsessed over this problem more than any other person on the planet. And we got our first check -- I was fresh out of college. I have no track record. And (inaudible) said, \"I believe in you. Here is $12,000.\" That was our initial funding. And --</p><p>BURKE: And not that much in tech these days.</p><p>OHANIAN: Not that much in tech these days.</p><p>BURKE: And I'm sure it felt like a lot at the time.</p><p>OHANIAN: It felt like a mountain of money and it was enough to get us started and get us to where Reddit is today. And so, do we believe these founders are capable of pulling of and the best thing they can show us is not where they went to university but what they have made, what they have built, how they think.</p><p>BURKE: What have you learned from your wife, Serena Williams?</p><p>OHANIAN: Lots. Everything. I always felt like I had a pretty great work ethic and then seeing her and everything that she does and having to do it with the scrutiny and the scale with which she does it -- you know, no one -- I don't have millions of people watching this a board meeting and I'm grateful for that. It's taught me a lot about what it takes to be great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, if you are a parent whose child has ever tried to fashion Wolverine claws out of cutlery or you've ever binged on a series of Jessica Jones on Netflix or if your idea of a perfect Saturday morning is just going to the comic store to find out what happened to Peter Parker, Bruce Banner or the Dark Phoenix, then you can thank one man for helping bring all these moments into your life.</p><p>Stan Lee, the former head of Marvel Comics, and the man hailed as a real life superhero for influencing the way the world itself imagines, there have been global tributes following Lee's death at age 95. But we wanted to focus on one in particular, from Marvel's arch nemesis, D.C. Comics, who put aside their historic epic rivalry to tweet this, quote, \"he changed the way we look at heroes and modern comics will always bear his indelible mark. His infectious enthusiasm reminded us why we all fell in love with these stories in the first place. Excelsior, Stan Lee.</p><p>Now, Stephanie Elam has more on the life of the Marvel Legend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Spider-man, Iron Man and X- Men, they're among the most iconic comic book heroes in history and they simply would not exist without Stan Lee. The visionary behind Marvel Comics lived a life almost as incredible as the characters he created.</p><p>STAN LEE, CREATOR OF MARVEL COMICS: I'm pretty proud of the fact that some of the stories that I wrote so many years ago are still being read and hopefully enjoyed by the public and people are making motion pictures based on them and television series.</p><p>ELAM: Spider-Man debuted in 1962 and became Lee's most successful comic book creation.</p><p>LEE: Spider-Man is my favorite because he's the most popular and he's known and loved worldwide.</p><p>[08:20:06] ELAM: Lee's spidey senses were tingling. Years later, in 2002, the first Spider-Man film was released and was a blockbuster hit.</p><p>LEE: As a child, I didn't really know anybody who shot webs or crawled on buildings or wore suits of armor and flew or anything like that. I just imagined them and there they are.</p><p>ELAM: He also imagined Thor, the Incredible Hulk and the Fantastic Four. They were flawed people with extraordinary powers.</p><p>LEE: I never had any idea that these characters would last this long. In fact, I and the people I worked with who co-created them with me, the many talented artists, we just hoped that the books would sell and we continue to get our salary and be able to pay our rent. The movies have done so much for the characters. The movies have given the comic book characters even more prestige.</p><p>ELAM: The native New Yorker was born Stanley Morgan Lieber. He had humble beginnings, but his love for comics took him much farther than he ever dreamed. He also earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>LEE: In a million years, I never thought that I would get something like this.</p><p>ELAM: As his creations became larger than life on the big screen, he also kept a feverish pace making appearances at events like Comic-Con in San Diego.</p><p>Though his life seemed charmed, it wasn't without adversity. Lee was married to his wife, Joan, for over 60 years and they had two daughters. However, his youngest only lived for a few days. In his 80s, Lee was involved in various lawsuits against Marvel and Disney over the span of seven years. In September 2012, he had surgery for a pacemaker and joked he was trying to become more like his Iron Man character, Tony Stark.</p><p>LEE: To me, the most important thing in the world is to keep busy. And I'm happy to say I'm lucky enough to still be busy.</p><p>ELAM: The Stan Lee Foundation was also a passion project for Lee who seemed to believe with great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>LEE: What we concentrate on is education, educating children.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stan Lee.</p><p>LEE: I he never would have dreamed years ago that anything like this would happen.</p><p>ELAM: The king of comics who was adored worldwide was most proud of his family and his comic heroes. Perhaps Lee will be remembered as a legendary innovator with an uncanny ability to capture the imagination.</p><p>LEE: Excelsior.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Let's bring in write, Brad Meltzer, who knew Stan Lee. He is the author of the \"New York Times\" best seller, \"The Escape Artist,\" and has new book out. It's called, \"I am Sonya Sotomayor.\" And he joins us now via Skype.</p><p>Brad, thank you for joining us in this beautiful social media post that you put up there. You write that Stan Lee, quote, Gave us creeds to live by, principles to emulate.\" Can you tell us more about that?</p><p>BRAD MELTZER, NOVELIST AND COMIC BOOK WRITER: Yeah. I think as we talk about Stan Lee, we want to talk about his co-creations, the Hulk and Spider-Man, and the X-Men and Iron Man, and those are all vital. Of course, they are. But for me, it's never been about the super powers.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah.</p><p>MELTZER: It's been about the lessons they give us. The most important part of the story is not Superman. The most important part of the story us Clack Kent because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we can do something amazing. And Stan Lee proved that you could use his lessons in real life. That's why his stories were so powerful. That's why you see him having such an impact on so many of us in the creative industry is because he was the one that gave us those lessons that we could apply to our real lives. It wasn't just about having spider powers or being able to turn green.</p><p>LU STOUT: So when look at his creations like Spider-Man, like the Incredible Hulk, what did Stan Lee stand for and what kind of lessons -- human lessons does he leave behind?</p><p>MELTZER: Yeah. I think for me what really got to me is that his lessons more than corporations, more than politicians, more than advertised that we see today, his lessons were based upon one thing and one thing only, good, just the idea of doing good for someone else, that that in itself was enough. And that is what I fear today. When I look around at our world, no matter where you live in this entire beautiful world is I fear that we've lost our sense of good. We know how to fight, make no mistake. But when you're fighting just for yourself, when you're fighting just for power, when you're fighting just for money, you've already lost. And Stan Lee taught me that when I was 10-years-old. I still and we all knew that lesson today.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. His comics, his lessons, they were about the good and the great. It was about heroism. And Brad, you knew Stan Lee through his comics but also through your work. What was he like as a person?</p><p>[08:25:04] MELTZER: You know, our conversations were always by our phone and e-mail and everything else and he was kind enough to invite me to work with him on some things. And when I was researching a book on Superman, everyone said you need to reach out to Stan Lee. And I thought, well, why would -- you know, Stan Lee is Marvel. That's not D.C. But he was there at the beginning and he knew Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and he told me all about those early days.</p><p>And what I marvel at -- excusing that pun -- is that Stan Lee was a child when they started this. These were children's dreams. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster who gave us Superman, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko would give us Spider-Man and the Avengers and so much more. They were children, young Jewish immigrants who just were like, \"You know what? I want to do some good and I want to make something creative.\" But the fact that their lessons still stand 75 years later and will stand 175 years later, that's not just the mark of -- oh, that's an interesting character or oh that's super power -- but the greatest stories don't tell us about the story. They tell us about ourselves.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah.</p><p>MELTZER: And that's what Stan Lee taught us. He taught us about out own levels of good. And to me, I will -- I will always carry those lessons with me, those lessons that you got to do good for other people, that you got to use your creativity to help other people. And for me, especially, that means one thing, in honor of him, that Stan Lee lives forever.</p><p>LU STOUT: Absolutely, using your creativity as a force for good. Brad Meltzer, thank you so much for joining us. Take care.</p><p>MELTZER: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT: You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still ahead, the U.S. president has claimed that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. But new satellite images could prove otherwise. We'll explain after the break.</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines. Palestinian health officials say Israeli air strikes have killed at least six people in Gaza. Israel says it launched the strikes after militants fired around 400 rockets and mortars on Monday. Israeli officials say the rocket fire killed at least one person in Israel. That's the first time it's happened since 2014.</p><p>In California, officials are now battling three different wildfires. One of which has become the deadliest in the state's history. At least 44 people have been killed and tens of thousands of hectares burned. The cause of the fires is still under investigation.</p><p>There are new claims about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The \"New York Times\" says that according to people who heard a recording of a phone call made after the killing, a member of the so-called hit squad gives the instruction tell your boss. According to U.S. officials cited by the Times, that may be a reference to Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman. Riyadh has long denied any prior knowledge of the operation.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is offering his gratitude to Japan for standing shoulder to shoulder with America over North Korea's nuclear program. Pence just arrived in Singapore after holding talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. And while there, he declared that the U.S., Japan and the world will accept nothing less than complete denuclearization. It all comes after new satellite images suggest that North Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program.</p><p>And joining us now for more on the report is CNN's Will Ripley. Will, Donald Trump has spoke of, quote, tremendous progress in regards to a nuclear-free North Korea. But according to this report, what's the reality on the ground?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You have to wonder what he was basing that information on because what we're going to see here, this is new to us, but this is well known to U.S. intelligence. These are satellite images that have been commercially analyzed by private analysts.</p><p>However, U.S. intel, military, South Korean military, they know about these sites. This is the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base. This is the overall view. Let's zoom it a little closer so you can actually see some of the images that have been uncovered here.</p><p>This is the view of the entire facility. You can see it's pretty substantial, located in the North Korean mountains. Let's get in closer because you want to see this -- specifically these tunnels. These are significant because North Korea has invested a lot in mobile missile launch technology.</p><p>They hide mobile launchers in tunnels like these, roll it out into the road, and then they can drive them to a secret site that only North Koreans know. So in the event of some sort of military situation, they can launch in less than an hour a potentially nuclear missile.</p><p>And they're not just building up these underground, you know, facilities but also the infrastructure on the site as well in terms of the buildings to house all of the soldiers that are there 24/7.</p><p>LU STOUT: So these secret sites are no longer secret.</p><p>RIPLEY: Right.</p><p>LU STOUT: What does this mean for the big picture goal here, the path to denuclearization?</p><p>RIPLEY: Well, I just want to point out, these were never secret to the United States or President Trump. Presumably, he knew about all of this when he claimed that the nuclear threat from North Korea was neutralized.</p><p>So why would he make that claim when U.S. intelligence knows that there's a lot more going on inside the country aside from the Punggye-ri nuclear test site where the entrances to the tunnels were demolished or, you know, the one satellite launch facility that North Korea is currently dismantling?</p><p>President Trump knew that. So why would he know about the existence of all these things? And a lot of analysts are saying it is because he wants to show then prove that his diplomacy with Kim Jong-un was different, that it was historic and that it brought about some sort of lasting change.</p><p>But the bottom line is, Kim's arsenal is still potent, it just far less public. He is not rolling out the missiles in parades anymore. He is not, you know, overtly launching them and testing them at the moment.</p><p>LU STOUT: It's hard to claim progress when this report is out there. So, in your term, what is U.S. likely to do next?</p><p>RIPLEY: Well, you know, it really depends on President Trump. I mean, he just said last week, things with North Korea are going well and there really is no rush. But if news reports are now characterizing this as North Korea deceiving the United States, which mind you, they're not, they have never actually agreed to give up their nuclear weapons program.</p><p>They said they're going to work towards denuclearization, but they never said they're going to stop developing ballistic missiles or the facilities that could launch them. So North Korea is still doing everything that it said it was going to do. Kim Jong-un said on his new year's address, he was going to continue to mass produce and bolster his nuclear deterrent. That's what he was doing.</p><p>But if President Trump sees news reports and somehow believes that he has been deceived even though he had access to the intelligence himself, could that influence his policy? That could be very dangerous, according to a lot of clear watchers (ph) who are concerned about this.</p><p>LU STOUT: Will Ripley, we thank you for your reporting.</p><p>There are streets around the world named after famous people, but what about a dish? In Vietnam, it is all about the food. We're going to take you there next on News Stream.</p><p>[08:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back.

China says it is backtracking on a decision to allow tiger and rhino products to be used for so-called medical purposes. Beijing now says a ban on the products will temporarily stay in place. In light of this, we spoke to renowned conservationist Jane Goodall. Here's part of my conservation with her a short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT (on camera): China had, and this caused a lot of concern, reversed a ban on the use of endangered animal products for medicinal purposes like rhino horn and tiger.

Is that good news?</p><p>GOODALL: I was just saying this morning, I picked up a newspaper, South China news, and I said i really don't want to look because it's all bad. Then I saw this announcement from China and I thought, yes. And the reason was internal protest, not from outside, but from inside. And that says a lot about the Chinese people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Be sure to check out more of my interview with Jane Goodall.

Samuel Burke takes a closer look at Dubai's bid to become the blockchain capital of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The graph here tells (ph) the government entities about the current status of the transaction.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This giant screen is projecting a new digital service that could transform the way Dubai operates. It's the city's new government-endorsed blockchain platform which is about to dramatically slash payment process times.</p><p>WESAM LOOTAH, CEO, SMART DUBAI GOVERNMENT: A process that used to take 45 days between government and between the banks is now completely eliminated. So this is now resources and money and time that the government can spend in serving the customers and citizens and resident.</p><p>BURKE: The payment service was designed here at the Smart Dubai offices. It's just part of the emirates plan to create the world's first paperless government by 2021. Dubai is banking on blockchain technology to help them do that. Blockchain, perhaps best known as the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, but its potential is far greater.</p><p>Global financial systems are built on a third party like a bank, validating transactions. Blockchain removes the need for the third party. Instead, transactions are verified and recorded across a decentralized network.</p><p>LOOTAH: Blockchain will allow business transactions to happen in the speed that we have now today with internet and information.</p><p>BURKE: Dubai plans to put most of its government services on blockchain. Transactions are said to be instant, paperless and transparent. This new payment service is a major step toward that goal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And this happened automatically?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Automatically.</p><p>BURKE: Tech giant IBM is one of Dubai's main partners on its blockchain journey.</p><p>ANTHONY BUTLER, CTO BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES, IBM: This collaboration with Dubai, with Smart Dubai, is really fulfilling that next step. And by doing so, all of those, as you said, all of those experiments, all of those initial efforts will now be able to move forward into real life use.</p><p>BURKE: Real life use requires real life hardware. IBM is incorporating some of its latest technology to help accelerate Dubai's blockchain plans. This mainframe is capable of running more than six billion web transactions per day.</p><p>BUTLER: Now we're at the stage where we want things to go live. We want things to scale. And in order for things to scale, there needs to be a platform that is secure, that is resilient, and that's where we are now.</p><p>LOOTAH: The reason why we embraced blockchain, we've seen the impact, the potential impact that blockchain can have.</p><p>BURKE: As an early adapter of blockchain, Dubai is creating a blueprint for others to follow.</p><p>[08:40:01] Now, with one of its first blockchain services going live, the foundation is being laid for the realization of its full potential.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: In Vietnam, a restaurant that used to feed hundreds of hungry soldiers has now become a landmark for the city and a tourist destination for visitors. Our Cyril Vanier takes a look at the special dish that has become so famous, it has its own screen (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CYRIL VANIER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On this small unassuming street, one of Hanoi's most famous dishes was born. So famous that the street was eventually named after it. This is Cha Ca Street.</p><p>NGUYEN MY GIANG HOUNG, FOUNDER, THE CLOVER AT NGOC THUY: Cha Ca means a dish made out of fish and it has to be a kind of grill or a crispy egg fry.</p><p>VANIER: Our guide on all things Cha Ca, chef and restaurateur Nguyen My Giang Houng, also known as Chef Tin (ph), who grew up nearby.</p><p>HOUNG: When I went out to Cha Ca Street, it brings me back to where I was as a child.</p><p>VANIER: The history of this marinated fish dish dates back over 130 years. Chef Tin (ph) says it all started when a local family began serving their specialty to army troops.</p><p>HOUNG: They used to be a family living here and when they saw troops coming to Hanoi, the family used to make one dish because they make it so good that everyone tell them, you should make a restaurant.</p><p>VANIER: And open a restaurant they did, at the very location where hungry soldiers were once fed.</p><p>HOUNG: Here we are. We are arriving to Cha Ca street. That is the house. Make the name for this street. Let's go inside.</p><p>VANIER: The restaurant is called Cha Ca La Vong. It has become an institution in Hanoi. Locals and tourists often line up to try the only thing on the menu. Cha Ca is served as a do it yourself assembly line of fresh herbs, including dill and spring onions, rice noodles, chili, shrimp paste sauce, and of course grilled marinated fish served sizzling on a hot pan.</p><p>HOUNG: People in Hanoi take food very seriously.

Palestinian health officials say that six people  have been killed in Israeli air strikes. Israel says it launched the  strikes as militants fired rockets and mortars into Israel. Hamas has fired  more than 400 rockets since Monday, killing one man inside Israel, the  first person killed in the country from rockets since 2014 war.</p><p>The escalation began following a botched Israeli undercover raid inside  Gaza. This is the worse surge of violence between the two sides in four  years.</p><p>CNN's Oren Lieberman is near the border in Sderot, Israel. He joins us now.  And Oren, we have seen this major escalation and violence. What's the  latest t border?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kristie, just moments ago, actually  right now, we're hearing explosions that might be either from rockets that  were fired as we did get some red alerts indicating rocket or mortar fire  or perhaps iron dome interceptions. We've seen -- we've heard a number of  those and we've gotten those red alerts indicating of continued rocket fire  over the course of the last hour.</p><p>As you point out, the Israeli military says more than 400 rockets have been  fired. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has itself from the air and the  ground carried out more than a hundred strikes against Hamas and  Palestinian Islamic Jihad military targets inside of Gaza.</p><p>That being said, even with what we just heard a few moments ago, this is  not the same phrenetic (ph) pace as we saw last night and early this  morning. In fact, here in Sderot, we're on the Gaza border. We're talking  to some of the people standing right next to us and they say they haven't  heard a red alarm here in Sderot since 6 o'clock in the morning. So, it's  difficult to say where things stand right now, but again this is not the  same hectic phrenetic (ph) pace of barrages of rockets and series of air  strikes that we saw last night.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah. No red alert, but no -- what are the prospects for a  cease-fire at this point?</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Well, we know from yesterday that Egypt and the United Nations  entered the picture here fairly quickly to try to bring both sides together  or rather keep them apart, keep them from getting to the edge of a war and  beginning a war. We've seen those two groups that is Egypt and the U.N.  successfully sort of mediate in the past and pull both sides back from the  edge in some of the sharp escalations we've seen over the past few months.</p><p>That being said, even if they're involved here, we did talk to one senior  international official who a few hours ago said he was pessimistic. One of  the key questions here is what happens in the next hour, Kristie. It was  right at sunset, which is about an hour away, that everything got serious  in terms of rocket fire and anti-tank missile fired from Gaza at a bus near  the Gaza periphery yesterday. We'll see if darkness brings more rocket fire  and that, of course, will mean more strikes in Gaza. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah. So, what happens next? You'll be monitoring that from the  border. But what led us to this moment of current hostilities between these  two sides? It goes back to this Israeli special ops operation of the  weekend that went awry. What happened and what was its objective?</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  It does. And it's worth pointing out that the weekend before  that, the Friday and Saturday before that, was one of the quietest we've  seen along the Gaza border of the course of the last half year. That after  Qatar sent in $15 million to try to ease some of the tensions here.</p><p>But on Sunday night, there is an Israeli special forces operation inside of  Gaza. According to the Qassam Brigades, the Hamas military wing, that  special forces raid was uncovered or discovered somehow. In the escalation  of hostilities that followed, one Israeli officer was killed, a high  ranking lieutenant colonel, as well a Hamas military commander and six  other Palestinians.</p><p>There was then a lull on Monday morning, a period of calm for a few hours.  And then Monday afternoon, that's when we've entered what we're seeing now,  an anti-tank missile hits a Israeli bus in the Gaza periphery seriously  wounding one. That then leads to rocket fire. Palestinian militant groups  inside of Gaza saying that's a response to the special forces raid. And  then the ensuing Israeli strikes across Gaza that have continued up until  this point.</p><p>Again, Kristie, we'll see where all these stands. It's not at the same pace  as we saw it last night. But that doesn't mean we can't get there very  quickly once again.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Oren Lieberman, reporting live for us, thank you. Now, there are  chilling new claims about the murder of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>[08:04:58] The \"New York Times\" says there is an audio recording of his  killing and in it a member of the so-called hit squad says the words,  quote, \"tell your boss.\" They were told over the phone. And U.S. officials,  as cited by the \"New York Times,\" thinks that boss could refer to the Saudi  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia has long denied any  knowledge of the operation.</p><p>Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul. She joins us now. And Jomana, yet another  revelation in this ongoing drift feed of leaks, but does this draw a line  to the Saudi crown prince himself?</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, at this time really, Kristie,  it is coming from Washington. As you mentioned there, this recording is  from the \"New York Times.\" They say they've spoken to three people who are  familiar with the audio recording of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. And in  this recording, they say that shortly after the journalist was murdered  inside the consulate, a phone call was made from one of the 15 Saudis who  was part of hit squad that was sent to Istanbul and he made a call to a  superior in which he says, quote, \"tell your boss,\" something along the  lines of the deed is done.</p><p>Now, this individual who made phone call according to the \"New York Times\"  is Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb. CNN has reported on him in the past month or so.  He is a former diplomat at the embassy in London. He is a security official  and intelligence officer. He is within the inner circle of the crown  prince.</p><p>But during that call, there is no mention of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman by name. But intelligence officials in the U.S. believed that that  term, your boss, refers to the crown prince. And we know from several U.S.  officials, Kristie, over the last several weeks saying that they believe an  operation like this that involves members of the inner circle would not  have happened without the direct knowledge of the young crown prince.</p><p>The Saudis have repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge of this, that  he had anything to do with this, and they blamed it on rogue elements. And  when it with comes specifically to this \"New York Times\" reporting, they  provided the newspaper with a statement going also as far as saying that  even that part of the recording doesn't exist. They say that Saudi  officials listened to it and they did not hear that part.</p><p>But again, there could be -- we could be talking about different  recordings. We could talk about Turkey basically providing various  recordings to the different governments, different countries, different  agencies. And some in the intelligence community believe this is as close  as it's going to get to a smoking gun that links MBS to the killing of  Khashoggi.</p><p>But what this does for sure is that it adds more pressure, not only on  Saudi Arabia, Kristie, but also the United States and other western  countries that have been provided with this audio of the killing to really  put pressure on the Saudis for answers. The most important question Turkey  has been seeking the answer to is who ordered the killing of Jamal  Khashoggi.</p><p>LU STOUT:  And the revelations, they just keep on coming. Jomana Karadsheh,  reporting live for us from Istanbul. Jomana, thank you.</p><p>And now to California where officials continue to battle multiple  wildfires, one of which is now the deadliest in the state's history. In  northern California, a massive fire has killed at least 42 people and  burned through more than a hundred thousand acres. It is believed to be  only 30 percent contained. And to the south, another fire is expected to  intensify today due to high wind. At least two with people have been killed  in that blaze. State regulators are now investigating two utility companies  that reported incidence close in time and location to the start of both  fires.</p><p>Let's bring in Dan Simon. He is on the scene for us in Paradise,  California. And Dan, the campfire you've been reporting on, it is now  officially the deadliest wildfire in California history. Is it still very  active and very much on the move?</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Kristie. First of all, there was a  concern at the very beginning of this fire that there was going to be a  high death toll given the fact that it really spreads so fast and that you  have a lot of elderly retirees who live in this community. We know that  today the focus is going to be on continuing to possibly find more bodies.</p><p>They're bringing in 150 or so more crews. There will be cadaver dogs out  looking for more bodies. And you also have the gruesome task of trying to  identify them. Keep in mind, many if not most of them are so badly burned  that they cannot be identified. So they are asking family members whom they  suspect may have lost love ones to provide a DNA sample so ultimately these  bodies can be identified.</p><p>In the meantime, Kristie, let me explain where I am real quick. You can see  these shopping carts. This is something pretty much everybody can identify  with. We're in front of what was a grocery store, completely burned out.  That just underscores just how much has been lost in this fire.</p><p>[08:10:05] And I also just want to tell you a little bit about how -- where  things stand. We're talking about 117,000 acres. The growth has been modest  in the last couple of days. So, that is good news. And the containment  number has gone up. The bad news is there is no rain in the forecast.  Things remain really dry. And so the threat persists for more fires in the  area. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  And as the families wait for answers, we know there is this grim  and delicate task under way to identify the remains that are being  discovered. How are the families coping as they wait for any update about  their loved ones?</p><p>SIMON:  It's very difficult. You have some 52,000 in the broader community  who have been evacuated and were just trying to get through day by day. And  I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people, they really aren't quite  sure if they're ever going to come back to Paradise. Keep in mind it's  going to be weeks -- it's going to be weeks before residents are allowed  back in. And that's just to go through and just sort of pick through the  rubble and try to, you know, find anything in your burned out house.</p><p>But in terms of when people will be living here again, I mean, who knows  when that is going to be. You know, you have houses and restaurants and  schools and churches and a whole infrastructure that has been destroyed. So  this is going to take many years for the town of Paradise to come back,  Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah. People want to pick up the pieces of their lives, their  homes. But what has been spared? What is left there in what looks like a  wasteland behind you? </p><p>Dan Simon reporting live for us from Paradise, California. Dan, thank you.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still right here on the program, Captain  America is bowing his head. The Punisher lays down his arms. The Avengers  assemble in grief. And somewhere out there, the Marvel universe is mourning  the death of the man who created it. We remember Stan Lee.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  It is Tuesday night here in Hong Kong. Welcome back. You're  watching \"News Stream.\"  Now, the world largest aviation data breach is  even worse than customers originally thought. Cathay Pacific now says it  knew of a massive cyberattack on its systems for months and was busy  looking out for other possible attacks before making any public statements.</p><p>Hong Kong's flagship airline says it took immediate action when it first  discovered the attack in March. So, why did it take so long to speak up  about it? Well, the airline says it was on alert for more intrusions and  wanted to give, quote, \"a single accurate and meaningful notification to  each passenger affected.\"</p><p>Now, more than 9 million people have been affected by the massive data  breach. Now, from Facebook's enormous data leak to global employee walkouts  at Google for handling of sexual misconduct cases, it has been a  challenging year for big tech.</p><p>[08:15:08] In a wide ranging interview, Samuel Burke sat down with the co- founder of Reddit to talk about some of these hot (ph) issues that the tech  industry is grappling with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, REDDIT CO-FOUNDER:  We absolutely need to curve the  radicalized behavior. I don't think -- I think any reasonable person agrees  that that is not healthy.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Hate speech,  harassment, how can that be allowed?</p><p>OHANIAN:  Harassment has been banned on the site basically since I came  back about three, four years ago. The gray area is in this like sort of  antisocial, unpopular rhetoric and the challenge is -- I mean it's  literally coming from the president of the United States, literally a tweet  from the president is in many ways pretty reprehensible and that's a front  page story on Reddit.</p><p>BURKE:  Facebook has spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to police  around elections, for fake news.</p><p>OHANIAN:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>BURKE:  Do you think that they've done enough?</p><p>OHANIAN:  I don't think the job had will ever be done. You can have teams  of thousands of people filling thousands of war rooms, but they still can't  keep up with hundreds of millions of connected people. But I think this is  where if AI and machine learning can do something really effectively, it's  to build better tools for the real time enforcement of what they're trying  to do. And whether that's from within Facebook or someone else who is  selling it to Facebook, I think that's the next frontier.</p><p>BURKE:  Did it surprise you when you found out that Google paid millions of  dollars in exit packages to people accused of sexual harassment?</p><p>OHANIAN:  Did it surprise me? No. In the wake of Me Too, one of the most  striking things was the structural malice that has been in place. I do not  expect this to be over. The system still feels like there's too much left  clogging it up. What will truly change things is when you see more women  who are getting the chance to get into positions of power that we start to  see a real sort of gender equality in the industry, but we are still a very  long way away from that.</p><p>BURKE:  What do you look for in companies you're investing in?</p><p>OHANIAN:  We want those founders to be relentless. We want to know that  they are not going to quit, but they've probably obsessed over this problem  more than any other person on the planet. And we got our first check -- I  was fresh out of college. I have no track record. And (inaudible) said, \"I  believe in you. Here is $12,000.\"  That was our initial funding. And --</p><p>BURKE:  And not that much in tech these days.</p><p>OHANIAN:  Not that much in tech these days.</p><p>BURKE:  And I'm sure it felt like a lot at the time.</p><p>OHANIAN:  It felt like a mountain of money and it was enough to get us  started and get us to where Reddit is today. And so, do we believe these  founders are capable of pulling of and the best thing they can show us is  not where they went to university but what they have made, what they have  built, how they think.</p><p>BURKE:  What have you learned from your wife, Serena Williams?</p><p>OHANIAN:  Lots. Everything. I always felt like I had a pretty great work  ethic and then seeing her and everything that she does and having to do it  with the scrutiny and the scale with which she does it -- you know, no one  -- I don't have millions of people watching this a board meeting and I'm  grateful for that. It's taught me a lot about what it takes to be great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, if you are a parent whose child has ever tried to fashion  Wolverine claws out of cutlery or you've ever binged on a series of Jessica  Jones on Netflix or if your idea of a perfect Saturday morning is just  going to the comic store to find out what happened to Peter Parker, Bruce  Banner or the Dark Phoenix, then you can thank one man for helping bring  all these moments into your life.</p><p>Stan Lee, the former head of Marvel Comics, and the man hailed as a real  life superhero for influencing the way the world itself imagines, there  have been global tributes following Lee's death at age 95. But we wanted to  focus on one in particular, from Marvel's arch nemesis, D.C. Comics, who  put aside their historic epic rivalry to tweet this, quote, \"he changed the  way we look at heroes and modern comics will always bear his indelible  mark. His infectious enthusiasm reminded us why we all fell in love with  these stories in the first place. Excelsior, Stan Lee.</p><p>Now, Stephanie Elam has more on the life of the Marvel Legend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Spider-man, Iron Man and X- Men, they're among the most iconic comic book heroes in history and they  simply would not exist without Stan Lee. The visionary behind Marvel Comics  lived a life almost as incredible as the characters he created.</p><p>STAN LEE, CREATOR OF MARVEL COMICS:  I'm pretty proud of the fact that some  of the stories that I wrote so many years ago are still being read and  hopefully enjoyed by the public and people are making motion pictures based  on them and television series.</p><p>ELAM:  Spider-Man debuted in 1962 and became Lee's most successful comic  book creation.</p><p>LEE:  Spider-Man is my favorite because he's the most popular and he's  known and loved worldwide.</p><p>[08:20:06] ELAM:  Lee's spidey senses were tingling. Years later, in 2002,  the first Spider-Man film was released and was a blockbuster hit.</p><p>LEE:  As a child, I didn't really know anybody who shot webs or crawled on  buildings or wore suits of armor and flew or anything like that. I just  imagined them and there they are.</p><p>ELAM:  He also imagined Thor, the Incredible Hulk and the Fantastic Four.  They were flawed people with extraordinary powers.</p><p>LEE:  I never had any idea that these characters would last this long. In  fact, I and the people I worked with who co-created them with me, the many  talented artists, we just hoped that the books would sell and we continue  to get our salary and be able to pay our rent. The movies have done so much  for the characters. The movies have given the comic book characters even  more prestige.</p><p>ELAM:  The native New Yorker was born Stanley Morgan Lieber. He had humble  beginnings, but his love for comics took him much farther than he ever  dreamed. He also earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>LEE:  In a million years, I never thought that I would get something like  this.</p><p>ELAM:  As his creations became larger than life on the big screen, he also  kept a feverish pace making appearances at events like Comic-Con in San  Diego.</p><p>Though his life seemed charmed, it wasn't without adversity. Lee was  married to his wife, Joan, for over 60 years and they had two daughters.  However, his youngest only lived for a few days. In his 80s, Lee was  involved in various lawsuits against Marvel and Disney over the span of  seven years. In September 2012, he had surgery for a pacemaker and joked he  was trying to become more like his Iron Man character, Tony Stark. </p><p>LEE:  To me, the most important thing in the world is to keep busy. And I'm  happy to say I'm lucky enough to still be busy.</p><p>ELAM:  The Stan Lee Foundation was also a passion project for Lee who  seemed to believe with great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>LEE:  What we concentrate on is education, educating children.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stan Lee. </p><p>LEE: I he never would have dreamed years ago that anything like this would  happen. </p><p>ELAM:  The king of comics who was adored worldwide was most proud of his  family and his comic heroes. Perhaps Lee will be remembered as a legendary  innovator with an uncanny ability to capture the imagination. </p><p>LEE:  Excelsior.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Let's bring in write, Brad Meltzer, who knew Stan Lee. He is the  author of the \"New York Times\" best seller, \"The Escape Artist,\" and has  new book out. It's called, \"I am Sonya Sotomayor.\"  And he joins us now via  Skype.</p><p>Brad, thank you for joining us in this beautiful social media post that you  put up there. You write that Stan Lee, quote, Gave us creeds to live by,  principles to emulate.\" Can you tell us more about that? </p><p>BRAD MELTZER, NOVELIST AND COMIC BOOK WRITER:  Yeah. I think as we talk  about Stan Lee, we want to talk about his co-creations, the Hulk and  Spider-Man, and the X-Men and Iron Man, and those are all vital. Of course,  they are. But for me, it's never been about the super powers.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah.</p><p>MELTZER:  It's been about the lessons they give us. The most important part  of the story is not Superman. The most important part of the story us Clack  Kent because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring  and ordinary and wish we can do something amazing. And Stan Lee proved that  you could use his lessons in real life. That's why his stories were so  powerful. That's why you see him having such an impact on so many of us in  the creative industry is because he was the one that gave us those lessons  that we could apply to our real lives. It wasn't just about having spider  powers or being able to turn green.</p><p>LU STOUT:  So when look at his creations like Spider-Man, like the  Incredible Hulk, what did Stan Lee stand for and what kind of lessons --  human lessons does he leave behind?</p><p>MELTZER:  Yeah. I think for me what really got to me is that his lessons  more than corporations, more than politicians, more than advertised that we  see today, his lessons were based upon one thing and one thing only, good,  just the idea of doing good for someone else, that that in itself was  enough. And that is what I fear today. When I look around at our world, no  matter where you live in this entire beautiful world is I fear that we've  lost our sense of good. We know how to fight, make no mistake. But when  you're fighting just for yourself, when you're fighting just for power,  when you're fighting just for money, you've already lost. And Stan Lee  taught me that when I was 10-years-old. I still and we all knew that lesson  today.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. His comics, his lessons, they were about the good and the  great. It was about heroism. And Brad, you knew Stan Lee through his comics  but also through your work. What was he like as a person?</p><p>[08:25:04] MELTZER:  You know, our conversations were always by our phone  and e-mail and everything else and he was kind enough to invite me to work  with him on some things. And when I was researching a book on Superman,  everyone said you need to reach out to Stan Lee. And I thought, well, why  would -- you know, Stan Lee is Marvel. That's not D.C. But he was there at  the beginning and he knew Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and he told me all  about those early days.</p><p>And what I marvel at -- excusing that pun -- is that Stan Lee was a child  when they started this. These were children's dreams. Jerry Siegel and Joe  Shuster who gave us Superman, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko  would give us Spider-Man and the Avengers and so much more. They were  children, young Jewish immigrants who just were like, \"You know what? I  want to do some good and I want to make something creative.\"  But the fact  that their lessons still stand 75 years later and will stand 175 years  later, that's not just the mark of -- oh, that's an interesting character  or oh that's super power -- but the greatest stories don't tell us about  the story. They tell us about ourselves.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah.</p><p>MELTZER:  And that's what Stan Lee taught us. He taught us about out own  levels of good. And to me, I will -- I will always carry those lessons with  me, those lessons that you got to do good for other people, that you got to  use your creativity to help other people. And for me, especially, that  means one thing, in honor of him, that Stan Lee lives forever.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Absolutely, using your creativity as a force for good. Brad  Meltzer, thank you so much for joining us. Take care.</p><p>MELTZER: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT:  You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still ahead, the U.S.  president has claimed that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. But  new satellite images could prove otherwise. We'll explain after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\"  and these are your world headlines. Palestinian health officials say  Israeli air strikes have killed at least six people in Gaza. Israel says it  launched the strikes after militants fired around 400 rockets and mortars  on Monday. Israeli officials say the rocket fire killed at least one person  in Israel. That's the first time it's happened since 2014.</p><p>In California, officials are now battling three different wildfires. One of  which has become the deadliest in the state's history. At least 44 people  have been killed and tens of thousands of hectares burned. The cause of the  fires is still under investigation.</p><p>There are new claims about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The  \"New York Times\" says that according to people who heard a recording of a  phone call made after the killing, a member of the so-called hit squad  gives the instruction tell your boss. According to U.S. officials cited by  the Times, that may be a reference to Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin  Salman. Riyadh has long denied any prior knowledge of the operation.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is offering his gratitude to Japan for  standing shoulder to shoulder with America over North Korea's nuclear  program. Pence just arrived in Singapore after holding talks with Japanese  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. And while there, he declared that the  U.S., Japan and the world will accept nothing less than complete  denuclearization. It all comes after new satellite images suggest that  North Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program.</p><p>And joining us now for more on the report is CNN's Will Ripley. Will,  Donald Trump has spoke of, quote, tremendous progress in regards to a  nuclear-free North Korea. But according to this report, what's the reality  on the ground?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You have to wonder what he was basing that  information on because what we're going to see here, this is new to us, but  this is well known to U.S. intelligence. These are satellite images that  have been commercially analyzed by private analysts.</p><p>However, U.S. intel, military, South Korean military, they know about these  sites. This is the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base. This is the overall  view. Let's zoom it a little closer so you can actually see some of the  images that have been uncovered here.</p><p>This is the view of the entire facility. You can see it's pretty  substantial, located in the North Korean mountains. Let's get in closer  because you want to see this -- specifically these tunnels. These are  significant because North Korea has invested a lot in mobile missile launch  technology.</p><p>They hide mobile launchers in tunnels like these, roll it out into the  road, and then they can drive them to a secret site that only North Koreans  know. So in the event of some sort of military situation, they can launch  in less than an hour a potentially nuclear missile.</p><p>And they're not just building up these underground, you know, facilities  but also the infrastructure on the site as well in terms of the buildings  to house all of the soldiers that are there 24/7.</p><p>LU STOUT:  So these secret sites are no longer secret.</p><p>RIPLEY:  Right.</p><p>LU STOUT:  What does this mean for the big picture goal here, the path to  denuclearization?</p><p>RIPLEY:  Well, I just want to point out, these were never secret to the  United States or President Trump. Presumably, he knew about all of this  when he claimed that the nuclear threat from North Korea was neutralized.</p><p>So why would he make that claim when U.S. intelligence knows that there's a  lot more going on inside the country aside from the Punggye-ri nuclear test  site where the entrances to the tunnels were demolished or, you know, the  one satellite launch facility that North Korea is currently dismantling?</p><p>President Trump knew that. So why would he know about the existence of all  these things? And a lot of analysts are saying it is because he wants to  show then prove that his diplomacy with Kim Jong-un was different, that it  was historic and that it brought about some sort of lasting change.</p><p>But the bottom line is, Kim's arsenal is still potent, it just far less  public. He is not rolling out the missiles in parades anymore. He is not,  you know, overtly launching them and testing them at the moment.</p><p>LU STOUT:  It's hard to claim progress when this report is out there. So,  in your term, what is U.S. likely to do next?</p><p>RIPLEY:  Well, you know, it really depends on President Trump. I mean, he  just said last week, things with North Korea are going well and there  really is no rush. But if news reports are now characterizing this as North  Korea deceiving the United States, which mind you, they're not, they have  never actually agreed to give up their nuclear weapons program.</p><p>They said they're going to work towards denuclearization, but they never  said they're going to stop developing ballistic missiles or the facilities  that could launch them. So North Korea is still doing everything that it  said it was going to do. Kim Jong-un said on his new year's address, he was  going to continue to mass produce and bolster his nuclear deterrent. That's  what he was doing.</p><p>But if President Trump sees news reports and somehow believes that he has  been deceived even though he had access to the intelligence himself, could  that influence his policy? That could be very dangerous, according to a lot  of clear watchers (ph) who are concerned about this.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Will Ripley, we thank you for your reporting.</p><p>There are streets around the world named after famous people, but what  about a dish? In Vietnam, it is all about the food. We're going to take you  there next on News Stream.</p><p>[08:35:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back. Now, we want to bring you more now on a win for  conservationists that we first told you about yesterday. China says it is  backtracking on a decision to allow tiger and rhino products to be used for  so-called medical purposes. Beijing now says a ban on the products will  temporarily stay in place. In light of this, we spoke to renowned  conservationist Jane Goodall. Here's part of my conservation with her a  short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT (on camera):  China had, and this caused a lot of concern,  reversed a ban on the use of endangered animal products for medicinal  purposes like rhino horn and tiger. But --</p><p>JANE GOODALL, PRIMATOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  Yes, but today --</p><p>LU STOUT (on camera):  -- they announced that they are sticking with the  ban, at least for now. Is that good news?</p><p>GOODALL:  I was just saying this morning, I picked up a newspaper, South  China news, and I said i really don't want to look because it's all bad.  Then I saw this announcement from China and I thought, yes. And the reason  was internal protest, not from outside, but from inside. And that says a  lot about the Chinese people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Be sure to check out more of my interview with Jane Goodall.  Find out what she would say about the world leaders like Donald Trump who  says he doesn't believe that climate change is a grave threat. That is  tomorrow on News Stream at the usual time, 9:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, 1:00  p.m. in London, only on CNN.</p><p>The global tech giant IBM has launched a platform with Dubai which allows  its government agencies to conduct all of its transactions through  blockchain. Samuel Burke takes a closer look at Dubai's bid to become the  blockchain capital of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The graph here tells (ph) the government entities about  the current status of the transaction.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  This giant  screen is projecting a new digital service that could transform the way  Dubai operates. It's the city's new government-endorsed blockchain platform  which is about to dramatically slash payment process times.</p><p>WESAM LOOTAH, CEO, SMART DUBAI GOVERNMENT:  A process that used to take 45  days between government and between the banks is now completely eliminated.  So this is now resources and money and time that the government can spend  in serving the customers and citizens and resident.</p><p>BURKE:  The payment service was designed here at the Smart Dubai offices.  It's just part of the emirates plan to create the world's first paperless  government by 2021. Dubai is banking on blockchain technology to help them  do that. Blockchain, perhaps best known as the technology behind the  digital currency bitcoin, but its potential is far greater.</p><p>Global financial systems are built on a third party like a bank, validating  transactions. Blockchain removes the need for the third party. Instead,  transactions are verified and recorded across a decentralized network. </p><p>LOOTAH:  Blockchain will allow business transactions to happen in the speed  that we have now today with internet and information.</p><p>BURKE:  Dubai plans to put most of its government services on blockchain.  Transactions are said to be instant, paperless and transparent. This new  payment service is a major step toward that goal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And this happened automatically?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Automatically.</p><p>BURKE:  Tech giant IBM is one of Dubai's main partners on its blockchain  journey.</p><p>ANTHONY BUTLER, CTO BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES, IBM:  This collaboration with  Dubai, with Smart Dubai, is really fulfilling that next step. And by doing  so, all of those, as you said, all of those experiments, all of those  initial efforts will now be able to move forward into real life use.</p><p>BURKE:  Real life use requires real life hardware. IBM is incorporating  some of its latest technology to help accelerate Dubai's blockchain plans.  This mainframe is capable of running more than six billion web transactions  per day. </p><p>BUTLER:  Now we're at the stage where we want things to go live. We want  things to scale. And in order for things to scale, there needs to be a  platform that is secure, that is resilient, and that's where we are now.</p><p>LOOTAH:  The reason why we embraced blockchain, we've seen the impact, the  potential impact that blockchain can have.</p><p>BURKE:  As an early adapter of blockchain, Dubai is creating a blueprint  for others to follow.</p><p>[08:40:01]  Now, with one of its first blockchain services going live, the  foundation is being laid for the realization of its full potential.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  In Vietnam, a restaurant that used to feed hundreds of hungry  soldiers has now become a landmark for the city and a tourist destination  for visitors. Our Cyril Vanier takes a look at the special dish that has  become so famous, it has its own screen (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CYRIL VANIER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  On this small unassuming street, one of  Hanoi's most famous dishes was born. So famous that the street was  eventually named after it. This is Cha Ca Street.</p><p>NGUYEN MY GIANG HOUNG, FOUNDER, THE CLOVER AT NGOC THUY:  Cha Ca means a  dish made out of fish and it has to be a kind of grill or a crispy egg fry.</p><p>VANIER:  Our guide on all things Cha Ca, chef and restaurateur Nguyen My  Giang Houng, also known as Chef Tin (ph), who grew up nearby.</p><p>HOUNG:  When I went out to Cha Ca Street, it brings me back to where I was  as a child.</p><p>VANIER:  The history of this marinated fish dish dates back over 130 years.  Chef Tin (ph) says it all started when a local family began serving their  specialty to army troops.</p><p>HOUNG:  They used to be a family living here and when they saw troops  coming to Hanoi, the family used to make one dish because they make it so  good that everyone tell them, you should make a restaurant.</p><p>VANIER:  And open a restaurant they did, at the very location where hungry  soldiers were once fed.</p><p>HOUNG:  Here we are. We are arriving to Cha Ca street. That is the house.  Make the name for this street. Let's go inside.</p><p>VANIER:  The restaurant is called Cha Ca La Vong. It has become an  institution in Hanoi. Locals and tourists often line up to try the only  thing on the menu. Cha Ca is served as a do it yourself assembly line of  fresh herbs, including dill and spring onions, rice noodles, chili, shrimp  paste sauce, and of course grilled marinated fish served sizzling on a hot  pan.</p><p>HOUNG:  People in Hanoi take food very seriously. Whatever is on the table  for them is important. It is a great moment.</p><p>VANIER:  But it's not just on Cha Ca Street that you can find this now  iconic Hanoi dish. Chefs all over Vietnam and the world have their own  interpretations.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  I need you to get me a plate of that good stuff. That is News  Stream.

The messages were sent after security researchers found that an Israeli company had been supplying spying software that specifically targeted WhatsApp users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once the targeted device is hacked through WhatsApp, it makes all the data on the phone available to the spies. Everything on the phone, be it email or other messaging platforms or photographs and documents, can then be easily accessed by the spy agency using the Israeli spyware. For WhatsApp, which features end-to-end encryption, the hack was a devastating blow to the security of its users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an uncharacteristic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/29/why-whatsapp-is-pushing-back-nso-group-hacking/\">opinion piece in The Washington Post</url>\u00a0published last week, Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, wrote about this massive attack on the platform.</p><p>\"In May, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/14/whatsapp-patches-security-flaw-that-allows-attackers-deliver-malware-through-calls/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3\">WhatsApp announced</url> that we had detected and blocked a new kind of cyberattack involving a vulnerability in our video-calling feature. A user would receive what appeared to be a video call, but this was not a normal call. After the phone rang, the attacker secretly transmitted malicious code in an effort to infect the victim\u2019s phone with spyware. The person did not even have to answer the call,\" Cathcart wrote.</p><p>The article was released as soon as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, <url normalizedValue=\"https://archive.org/details/NSO_Group_WhatsApp_Petition\">filed a complaint against the Israeli company</url>, NSO Group, in a US federal court. The petition, which has been seen by Asia Times, reveals the extent to which the spyware supplied by NSO Group has been used globally. Interestingly, the spying software's code has special clauses that limit its ability to target American and Israeli citizens, according to the petition filed in the US federal court.</p><p>The shock waves being felt across the world continue to intensify as more names of people who were targeted are revealed.</p><h>A spyware called Pegasus</h><p>From August 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://citizenlab.ca/about/\">The Citizen Lab</url>, part of the Munk School for Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada, was tracking the deployment of spying software by NSO Group. They scanned the internet looking for servers that left behind traces of the spying software. By August 2018, they had found that citizens and networks in 45 countries had been targeted by this particular spying software from NSO Group.</p><p>In a detailed report published earlier this year, Citizen Lab detailed how it found the spyware and identified who the possible targets were. They were confident enough to identify the spyware by its name \u2013 Pegasus, also known as Q Suite.</p><p>Not since the revelations made by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden has anything created such a furor over citizens being targeted for surveillance. Big tech companies like Facebook are wary of being targeted and scaring users off their platforms. \"That is why Facebook decided to push back this time,\" a US-based senior company official told Asia Times. \"Big tech companies are no longer willing to accede to government agencies for surveillance.\"</p><p>Pegasus is different from normal phone or physical surveillance because it offers complete and irreversible control of the target\u2019s phone. As the contract that NSO Group signed with the government of Ghana indicates, the spyware can even survive a factory reset of the phone, in the case of those using Google's Android operating system. Put simply, the capabilities of Pegasus are so advanced that it allows surveillance of the target's thoughts as soon as they start typing.</p><p>However, that is not the end of it. The key-logger built into the spyware saves the usernames and passwords of other sensitive accounts operating from the infected device. This allows for the sending of emails and even the planting of false evidence in the target's Google account. Ironically, this gives a target infected by Pegasus an opportunity to claim that any evidence used against them by law enforcement agencies is \"fabricated.\" This ends up defeating the very purpose for which the company claims Pegasus was created.</p><p>The contract that NSO Group signed with Ghana offers further insights into how the surveillance operation works. It involves rack-mounted <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array\">storage arrays</url> of massive capacity that rain into\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte\">petabytes</url>. They also had dedicated       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)\">routers</url> and switches for moving data, data processing servers, an SMS gateway and modems. It also facilitated functional cellular network connections at a strength of -95 dBm. The set-up would also have symmetric ATM lines and fiberoptic connections to ensure dedicated high-speed connectivity. Each operator network deploying Pegasus had two anonymous SIM cards to attack their targets through WhatsApp.</p><p>The full hardware cost was $8 million and the annual service contract was for $ 1.76-million.</p><p>The contract clearly shows that it is a tripartite agreement between NSO Group, the end-user, which is usually a government intelligence agency, and a local systems integrator. This model opens the surveillance engine to third parties, which creates more potential for abuse. From the documents, it is also clear that government agencies that used Pegasus did not have full control over how this data was stored and accessed by NSO Group.</p><h>The targets</h><p>The United States, India, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Ghana, Brazil, Kuwait and Pakistan are among a host of countries whose citizens were targeted by Pegasus.</p><p>In December last year, it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-a-chilling-saudi-cyberwar-ensnared-jamal-khashoggi/2018/12/07/f5f048fe-f975-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html\">revealed that Pegasus</url> had also helped Saudi assassins to target Saudi journalist Jamaal Khashoggi. A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, was lured into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Once inside, he was tortured, killed and dismembered with a bone saw.</p><p>In India, targets included well-known scholars like Dr Bela Bhatia, who is working to advance tribal rights, and lawyers representing other human rights defenders in courts in the western state of Maharashtra. It also included teachers and scholars from Delhi University and at least one former minister for civil aviation in the previous government.</p><p>\"WhatsApp reached out to all these people and informed them after we had found evidence that they had been targeted. We saw outlier user behavior and saw their data was being compromised. So we worked with third-party experts like The Citizen Lab to trace the attackers and their victims,\" a senior WhatsApp representative said.</p><p>Much of their findings go against claims made by NSO Group's main promoters.</p><p>Novalpina Capital, which owns NSO Group,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.novalpina.pe/response-to-open-letter-to-novalpina-capital-on-15-april-2019/\">issued a detailed public statement</url> in response to several open letters from The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International after the scandal came to light.</p><p>In a public statement, Novalpina Capital stressed that it had ensured there was no misuse of its spying software. \"The company\u2019s technology is designed in such a way that it can only be deployed by an intelligence or law enforcement agency to whom the technology is sold under license. NSO has no involvement whatsoever in any end-user agency\u2019s tactical deployment decisions,\" it said.</p><p>But mounting evidence backed by technical specifications has now proved beyond doubt that many citizens were being targeted across the world. Researchers found that\u00a0in Mexico in 2017\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/\">lawyers, journalists and even a child</url> were targeted by the NSO spyware. In August 2016, a UAE-based activist, Ahmed Mansoor, was also targeted.</p><p>It was also revealed that NSO Group helped set up fake domains on the internet to lure the targets. Once they clicked on these fake domains, the spying software would be installed on their device, enabling state agencies to monitor all their online activities round the clock.</p><h>Failure to protect citizens</h><p>Surveillance laws in many countries strictly regulate how people are targeted. In a country like India, surveillance is allowed under very exceptional circumstances. An Indian Supreme Court order from December 1996 ensures several checks and balances in the system to prevent the misuse of surveillance.</p><p>Inquiries made by Asia Times reveal that at least one federal intelligence agency that concentrates on generating intelligence from every state was one of the buyers of the Pegasus spying software. However, how and why this was deployed, and how the targets were chosen, is yet to be ascertained.</p><p>Spying software such as Pegasus helps state agencies to easily circumvent these established protocols. For instance, since there is no requirement to contact the internet service provider or the cellphone company, it has unfettered access to targeted individuals.</p><p>The reaction from the Indian government after this was revealed led to claims and counter-claims. The union minister for telecommunications and information technology, Ravishankar Prasad, claimed on Twitter that officials were never informed about this by WhatsApp. However, it was quickly revealed that not only was the Indian government informed, it was actually informed twice.</p><p>In May 2019, WhatsApp sent a detailed report to the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-IN), the nodal body for such cyberattack cases.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cert-in.org.in/\">mission of CERT-IN</url> is to be the \u201cnational nodal agency for responding to computer security incidents as and when they occur.\u201d It is also responsible for collection, analysis and dissemination of cyber incidents and regularly publishes information on CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures). Given that it is now established beyond doubt that it was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191103131137/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:N_suD-q3liwJ:https://www.cert-in.org.in/s2cMainServlet%3Fpageid%3DPUBVLNOTES01%26VLCODE%3DCIVN-2019-0080+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">informed by WhatsApp</url> that it was indeed possible to infect devices via a video call, senior government officials told journalists off the record that the report was \"technical jargon.\"</p><p>However, this was also called out as details of the full report show links to media reports that explained in plain language what had happened. It seems no one on CERT-IN actually read the report. In September this year, WhatsApp again alerted the Indian government and shared the fact that 121 Indians had been targeted. Once again, this was ignored by the Indian government.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/Tender_Document_7(4)2019.pdf\">review of the tender documents</url> put out by CERT-IN point to a potential and immediate cause, the lack of money (about US$8,000) is allocated to security research annually. This is limited to buying forensic tools. In contrast, Citizen Labs       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://citizenlab.ca/about/\">receives substantial funding</url> from various donor organizations and has built substantial expertise over the years to track surveillance software.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Also read:\u00a0Cyberattack scare dogs India\u2019s nuclear plants</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Screenshot from The Citizen Lab report shows how the Pegasus malware could extract all kinds of information from the device.

The messages were sent after security researchers found that an Israeli company had been supplying spying software that specifically targeted WhatsApp users.Once the targeted device is hacked through WhatsApp, it makes all the data on the phone available to the spies. Everything on the phone, be it email or other messaging platforms or photographs and documents, can then be easily accessed by the spy agency using the Israeli spyware. For WhatsApp, which features end-to-end encryption, the hack was a devastating blow to the security of its users.In an uncharacteristicopinion piece in The Washington Post published last week, Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, wrote about this massive attack on the platform.\"In May,WhatsApp announcedthat we had detected and blocked a new kind of cyberattack involving a vulnerability in our video-calling feature. A user would receive what appeared to be a video call, but this was not a normal call. </p><p>After the phone rang, the attacker secretly transmitted malicious code in an effort to infect the victim's phone with spyware. The person did not even have to answer the call,\" Cathcart wrote.The article was released as soon as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook,filed a complaint against the Israeli company , NSO Group, in a US federal court. The petition, which has been seen by Asia Times, reveals the extent to which the spyware supplied by NSO Group has been used globally.The shock waves being felt across the world continue to intensify as more names of people who were targeted are revealed.<br/>A spyware called PegasusFrom August 2016,The Citizen Lab , part of the Munk School for Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada, was tracking the deployment of spying software by NSO Group. They scanned the internet looking for servers that left behind traces of the spying software. By August 2018, they had found that citizens and networks in 45 countries had been targeted by this particular spying software from NSO Group.In a detailed report published earlier this year, Citizen Lab detailed how it found the spyware and identified who the possible targets were. They were confident enough to identify the spyware by its name - Pegasus, also known as Q Suite.Not since the revelations made by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden has anything created such a furor over citizens being targeted for surveillance. Big tech companies like Facebook are wary of being targeted and scaring users off their platforms. \"That is why Facebook decided to push back this time,\" a US-based senior company official told Asia Times. \"Big tech companies are no longer willing to accede to government agencies for surveillance.\"<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-11/04/AT_7c38d7e5-0_Image_In_Body.png\"/>Screenshot from The Citizen Lab report shows how the Pegasus malware could extract all kinds of information from the device. Photo: Courtesy The Citizen LabPegasus is different from normal phone or physical surveillance because it offers complete and irreversible control of the target's phone. As the contract that NSO Group signed with the government of Ghana indicates, the spyware can even survive a factory reset of the phone, in the case of those using Google's Android operating system. Put simply, the capabilities of Pegasus are so advanced that it allows surveillance of the target's thoughts as soon as they start typing.However, that is not the end of it. The key-logger built into the spyware saves the usernames and passwords of other sensitive accounts operating from the infected device. This allows for the sending of emails and even the planting of false evidence in the target's Google account. Ironically, this gives a target infected by Pegasus an opportunity to claim that any evidence used against them by law enforcement agencies is \"fabricated.\" This ends up defeating the very purpose for which the company claims Pegasus was created.The contract that NSO Group signed with Ghana offers further insights into how the surveillance operation works. It involves rack-mountedstorage arraysof massive capacity that rain into petabytes . They also had dedicatedroutersand switches for moving data, data processing servers, an SMS gateway and modems. It also facilitated functional cellular network connections at a strength of -95 dBm. The set-up would also have symmetric ATM lines and fiberoptic connections to ensure dedicated high-speed connectivity. Each operator network deploying Pegasus had two anonymous SIM cards to attack their targets through WhatsApp.The full hardware cost was $8 million and the annual service contract was for $ 1.76-million.The contract clearly shows that it is a tripartite agreement between NSO Group, the end-user, which is usually a government intelligence agency, and a local systems integrator. This model opens the surveillance engine to third parties, which creates more potential for abuse. From the documents, it is also clear that government agencies that used Pegasus did not have full control over how this data was stored and accessed by NSO Group.<br/>The targetsThe United States, India, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Ghana, Brazil, Kuwait and Pakistan are among a host of countries whose citizens were targeted by Pegasus.In December last year, it wasrevealed that Pegasushad also helped Saudi assassins to target Saudi journalist Jamaal Khashoggi. A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, was lured into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Once inside, he was tortured, killed and dismembered with a bonesaw.In India, targets included well-known scholars like Dr Bela Bhatia, who is working to advance tribal rights, and lawyers representing other human rights defenders in courts in the western state of Maharashtra. It also included teachers and scholars from Delhi University and at least one former minister for civil aviation in the previous government.\"WhatsApp reached out to all these people and informed them after we had found evidence that they had been targeted. We saw outlier user behavior and saw their data was being compromised. So we worked with third-party experts like The Citizen Lab to trace the attackers and their victims,\" a senior WhatsApp representative said.Much of their findings go against claims made by NSO Group's main promoters.Novalpina Capital, which owns NSO Group, issued a detailed public statementin response to several open letters from The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International after the scandal came to light.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-11/04/AT_7c38d7e5-0_Image_In_Body.png\"/>Screenshot of the targets of Pegasus spying software detected by Citizen Lab. Photo: Courtesy The Citizen LabIn a public statement, Novalpina Capital stressed that it had ensured there was no misuse of its spying software. \"The company's technology is designed in such a way that it can only be deployed by an intelligence or law enforcement agency to whom the technology is sold under license. NSO has no involvement whatsoever in any end-user agency's tactical deployment decisions,\" it said.But mounting evidence backed by technical specifications has now proved beyond doubt that many citizens were being targeted across the world. Researchers found that\u00a0in Mexico in 2017 lawyers, journalists and even a childwere targeted by the NSO spyware. In August 2016, a UAE-based activist, Ahmed Mansoor, was also targeted. It was also revealed that NSO Group helped set up fake domains on the internet to lure the targets. Once they clicked on these fake domains, the spying software would be installed on their device, enabling state agencies to monitor all their online activities round the clock.<br/>Failure to protect citizensSurveillance laws in many countries strictly regulate how people are targeted. In a country like India, surveillance is allowed under very exceptional circumstances. An Indian Supreme Court order from December 1996 ensures several checks and balances in the system to prevent the misuse of surveillance.Inquiries made by Asia Times reveal that at least one federal intelligence agency that concentrates on generating intelligence from every state was one of the buyers of the Pegasus spying software. However, how and why this was deployed, and how the targets were chosen, is yet to be ascertained.Spying software such as Pegasus helps state agencies to easily circumvent these established protocols. For instance, since there is no requirement to contact the internet service provider or the cellphone company, it has unfettered access to targeted individuals.The reaction from the Indian government after this was revealed led to claims and counter-claims. The union minister for telecommunications and information technology, Ravishankar Prasad, claimed on Twitter that officials were never informed about this by WhatsApp. However, it was quickly revealed that not only was the Indian government informed, it was actually informed twice.In May 2019, WhatsApp sent a detailed report to the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-IN), the nodal body for such cyberattack cases.Themission of CERT-INis to be the 'national nodal agency for responding to computer security incidents as and when they occur.' It is also responsible for collection, analysis and dissemination of cyber incidents and regularly publishes information on CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures). Given that it is now established beyond doubt that it wasinformed by WhatsAppthat it was indeed possible to infect devices via a video call, senior government officials told journalists off the record that the report was \"technical jargon.\"However, this was also called out as details of the full report show links to media reports that explained in plain language what had happened. It seems no one on CERT-IN actually read the report. In September this year, WhatsApp again alerted the Indian government and shared the fact that 121 Indians had been targeted. Once again, this was ignored by the Indian government.Areview of the tender documentsput out by CERT-IN point to a potential and immediate cause, the lack of money (about US$8,000) is allocated to security research annually. This is limited to buying forensic tools. In contrast, Citizen Labsreceives substantial fundingfrom various donor organizations and has built substantial expertise over the years to track surveillance software.

Since then, it has been hosting clients out of Asia - including from South-east Asia, Greater China, and Japan - at a steady clip, and plans to add more offices in Asia soon. This is relevant as according to Israeli data firm StartupHub.ai, OurCrowd is the most active investor in AI startups in Israel, with some 26 investments in total.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Denes Ban, managing director of Asia at Israel's equity venture crowdfunding platform OurCrowd, tells BT at the sidelines of OurCrowd's annual summit in Jerusalem in March that Asian investors are expected to make up the bulk of the platform's investor base in time.</p><p>As it is, flows from Asia have in the last couple of years made up more than half of the funding recently invested on their site. OurCrowd plans to raise between US$30 million and US$50 million with an Asian partner for its first Asia fund in the next 18 months. This Asia fund will draw funds from investors in Asia, and offer access to international tech companies, including those from Israel and Asia.</p><p>Partnering with banks offers Israeli startups a way in to tap Asia's burgeoning wealth. And this comes as Israel's AI startup ecosystem is blossoming, with more than 950 active startups using or developing AI technologies as at Aug 30, 2018, data from Israeli tech data firm StartupHub.ai showed.</p><p>Over the last five years, an average of 140 startups are established annually. AI startups raised close to US$2 billion in funds in 2017, up 70 per cent from 2016.</p><p>OurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved told media at its summit that Israel and China today are among the top global locations building out AI. And AI is rapidly emerging as an essential sector, both in terms of today's business needs and where investors want to bank their money. \"If you want to get venture capital, mention AI. In fact, if you don't have AI as part of your pitch, you're sort of in trouble,\" he had said.</p><p>While not directly comparative, a Tsinghua University report as cited by South China Morning Post showed that China's AI market was worth some US$3.55 billion in 2017, in itself up 67 per cent from the year before.</p><p>Against this backdrop, banks in Singapore are keen to work with Israel firms, tapping their expertise in screening and developing technology offerings. OurCrowd meanwhile has worked its way through Asia by partnering a local bank in each Asian country, with UOB as its Singapore choice in 2016.</p><p>The benefits work in two ways: banks are keen to work with Israeli firms directly to raise their game by using data, fending off competition from Big Tech. Banks here can also tie up with players such as OurCrowd to help its Asian business clients source for new ideas in restructuring their traditional businesses for Industry 4.0, as well as invest in tech outfits that may take off in this new data economy.</p><p>This week in Brunch, we speak with UOB to understand its ties to OurCrowd, as well as two up-and-coming Israeli fintechs that are keen to dive deeper into the world of Asian business and finance, through Singapore.</p><p>Helping Asian banks fend off Big Tech</p><p>WITH the launch of Apple Card in the US some months ago, more banks in Asia are sitting up to the competition that may soon come pounding at their doors.</p><p>And what Apple Card - a partnership between Apple and a new consumer-finance entrant Goldman Sachs - offers is a new way of banking by using data to offer personalised services based on a consumer's lifestyle patterns. Apple says it can tag the data using machine learning, deciphering purchases and categorising them into food or clothing sales, so each customer can easily find out their spending patterns and understand plainly if they have been credit-binging.</p><p>In the wake of that game-changing move, banks are struggling to clean up the enormous amounts of data that pass through their transactions every minute. To help them score better through data analytics, Israel's artificial intelligence (AI) firm Personetics offers a solution to regional banks that see potential in tapping the burgeoning millennial market in Asean.</p><p>Personetics' senior director for Asia Pacific Shalom Sagi says it is in \"more advanced talks\" with several banks in Thailand and Malaysia to sell its AI services that would allow banks to draw patterns from transactional data.</p><p>Personetics' services include setting up triggers for when a customer needs to top up his account balance to cover upcoming payments. Its service also allows the bank to nudge customers to save more or to spend wisely, creating a stickier relationship for the bank.</p><p>Personetics is itself backed by several global banks such as Spanish lender Banco Santander, and Singapore's own UOB. It has an office in Singapore, and is using it as a springboard to launch into other parts of Asia, says Mr Sagi.</p><p>Beyond selling AI services for data analytics, Personetics looks to eventually offer \"self-driving finance\", where customers can get automated advice and transfer of savings into investments, or to use savings to reduce debt, based on real-time projections of cashflow balances.</p><p>\"It's about creating engagement, and that creates true ROI (return on investment) for the banks today.\"</p><p>Personetics is already working with UOB on the bank's digital offshoot known as TMRW, that was launched officially in February this year.</p><p>First launched in Thailand, TMRW aims to attract three to five million Asean customers in the next five years, which mainly involve millennials who transact heavily on their mobile phones. The deal has spurred more conversations with South-east Asian banks eager to collaborate as well, says Mr Sagi.</p><p>And as more digital or challenger banks step up with services in Asia, Personectics sees room to boost its growth out of this region. While it has just two staff members here now, it plans to add more staff in its Singapore office in time.</p><p>\"In the last two or more years, the competition with the tech giants have been around the corner when we have these discussions with banks,\" says Mr Sagi, pointing to interest from Apple, Amazon, Google and Alibaba in financial services.</p><p>\"These are very strong competition - and we're saying to banks that if they don't look out, in a very short time, Apple is going to replace (them).\"</p><p>Can banks be more than fair-weather friends'</p><p>WE'VE all heard this before: banks can be a fairweather friend.</p><p>When all is fine and sunny, banks roundly support businesses through the good times. But when dark clouds gather, banks pull credit lines needed to get through a difficult period.</p><p>This criticism of banks and their so-dubbed mercenary tack does not escape Janet Young, managing director and head of group channels and digitalisation at UOB, who in March shepherded a busload of business clients from markets including Singapore, China, and Vietnam, to the annual OurCrowd summit held in Jerusalem.</p><p>There, these small-and-medium enterprise (SME) clients from South-east Asia mingled with portfolio companies of OurCrowd, a UOB-backed venture capital setup in Israeli that would matchmake accredited investors to its portfolio companies through equity crowdfunding.</p><p>It's an outdated view, says Ms Young, that on a rainy day, a bank takes an umbrella away. Instead, banks are increasingly trying to work with SME clients to ease them into restructuring for the future. This is a future that includes not just investing in technology, but also in sharpening their thinking to tackle a much larger opportunity in an increasingly borderless world.</p><p>Behind closed doors, banks with SME clients will say that while headline numbers suggest that SME funding is lacking, the reality that lenders struggle with is in getting SMEs to tackle strategy.</p><p>As one reflection of this, UOB has an FDI (foreign direct investment) advisory unit that it uses to draw investment flows from SMEs in the region looking to invest, but that need guidance on how to expand into new markets that may be more difficult to navigate. The difficulties come given a cocktail of issues ranging from capital controls to the differing business conditions that suggests South-east Asia is anything but homogeneous.</p><p>When UOB began working with OurCrowd in 2015, its starting point was to bring together the investing needs of its SME clients, and the leadiing-edge ideas from Israel - a place that offers deep-tech solutions and is one of the largest hubs for artificial intelligence services globally.</p><p>\"The genesis was in connecting smart ideas and smart money,\" Ms Young tells The Business Times.</p><p>As time passed, the bank noticed that smart money extended beyond investing for themselves to increase personal wealth, but was also looking for ways to future-proof their businesses by integrating available technologies from vendors such as tech startups.</p><p>Working with OurCrowd - in which UOB has invested more than US$10 million directly for an undisclosed equity stake - the bank also found that the VCs' due diligence tests can offer a dress rehearsal for SMEs looking to expand its business into new markets.</p><p>UOB has referred a handful of SMEs, including tech companies under its tech incubator programmes, to OurCrowd, for them to be considered as portfolio companies of OurCrowd.</p><p>In undergoing an estimated six-month scrutiny by a venture capital investor, such SMEs are asked tough questions on whether their products and services are scalable, and whether the current traditional business will be able to pivot into a new service that is ripe for the new economy. \"It offers a reality check,\" says Ms Young.</p><p>The bank itself is also changing - at its own pace - to assess SMEs beyond just looking at financials, and revenue projections. In some cases, it is trying to look at customer engagement metrics, to understand if these digital businesses are capturing customer engagement by offering a superior customer experience compared to their peers.</p><p>By moving along the deeper needs of its SME clients, UOB can move away from a \"commoditised\" way of working with SMEs, going beyond offering a credit facility, to growing with the clients looking to scale for the new economy.</p><p>\"Businesses are so keen today to find and tap new reserves of ideas and innovation, that maybe their original businesses can come up with as well... so instead of lending them (money), this helps them to sharpen their addressable market and target audience,\" Ms Young says.</p><p>She adds that the message of reaching a much bigger market, beyond Singapore, is now sinking in among Singapore corporates. And to push SMEs to try, Israel's experience offers a refreshingly forgiving attitude towards risks and business mishaps - a lesson for Singapore SMEs that may be too risk-averse to take that first step out.</p><p>\"The acceptance of failures is very commonplace here (in Israel).\"</p><p>Cybercrime: finding snakes amid the butterflies</p><p>THE way to understand how suspicious transactions can be missed by banks is to think about a system that has been trained to identify millions of butterflies.</p><p>But while that system, akin to a digital lepidopterarium, is perfectly able to identify positive cases, it will not be able to pick out scorpions or snakes because it simply hasn't been trained to do so.</p><p>So banks' instructions to the system is to \"show me everything that is not a butterfly\", says Mark Gazit, CEO of Israeli cybersecurity firm ThetaRay.</p><p>This results in a tremendous load of anomalies - scorpions and snakes that don't fit normal transaction patterns - that compliance officers at banks have to sift through to pick out the false positives from the mix.</p><p>\"In the last five years, the world of financial crime has totally changed. Criminals no longer go into branches to shoot and steal money,\" says Mr Gazit. \"And most of the cybercriminals today are not there to deface websites. It is a very lucrative business.\"</p><p>ThetaRay steps in by effectively trying to codify intuition through machine learning, says Mr Gazit. It taps the part of the mind that draws relationships with parameters.</p><p>When someone with a salary of S$2,500 a month gets a sudden million-dollar drop into his or her account, or if he cuts cheques or make bank transfers regularly in small, but consistent amounts to a seemingly unrelated party, these are red flags that a system can be trained to pick up.</p><p>This is how the brain works, in joining dots to make connections. Or as Mr Gazit says, when looking at a fresh face, the mind does not pick on the exact distance between the eyes. \"You just look at the proportion.\"</p><p>With Asia swelling in wealth, ThetaRay is taking calls from banks from places such as China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia, that want to tap into the tech firm's artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.</p><p>ThetaRay is already working with Singapore's OCBC on a pilot, which an OCBC spokesman told BT remains ongoing. Its pilot, first announced in 2017, showed that ThetaRay's technology was able to reduce the number of alerts that did not require further review by 35 per cent. The accuracy rate of identifying suspicious transactions increased by more than four times, the bank said. The test was based on one year's worth of OCBC corporate banking transaction data, with the data anonymised.</p><p>Mr Gazit also sees Singapore regulators as forward-thinking when it comes to using AI to combat cybercrime. As it is, Mr Gazit was recently appointed to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's International Technology Advisory Panel. The panel advises the Singapore regulator on international developments in fintech. Mr Gazit will be on the panel for the customary two-year term.</p><p>With the recent appointment, Mr Gazit, who also chairs an industry association for fintechs in Israel, hopes to also bring more attention to fintech companies out of his country.</p><p>He points out that Israel can offer deep-tech cybersecurity solutions to the rest of the world because it is a product of its environment. \"Israel has eight million people.

Taking into account follow-on transactions, the total amount of deals (IPOs and M&amp;As) for 2019 jumps to close to $23 billion, from $13.5 billion in 2018, the data shows.</p><p>Summing up the data from the past decade, the report said, there were 587 exit deals, for a total value of over $70 billion. When taking into account follow-on transactions \u2014 like Mobileye, Orbotech and others which had an initial public offering of shares and later were acquired, the last decade provided \"a whopping $107.8 billion in deals,\" PwC said in a statement.</p><p>The most prominent sectors for exits during the decade were semiconductor firms, computing, software startups and life science companies, accounting for 30.5%, 28.5% and 16.7% of deals, respectively.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (third from left) meets with Intel Corp.

(the deal is still awaiting regulatory approvals) earlier this year made it the biggest deal for 2019, and the second biggest tech deal in Israel on record, after Mobileye. That, plus Habana Labs, acquired by Intel Corp. for $2 billion and Click, acquired by Salesforce for $1.35 billion, were the three biggest deals of 2019.</p><p>Looking back on the last decade, 2019 was the third best year in total deal value (after 2014 and 2015) and the best year in total number of deals, 80. In 2014, a record year for Israeli technology, the value of exit deals totaled some $14.9 billion, in 70 deals, and in 2015 this div was $10.7 billion, also in 70 deals, according to the data. In 2010, the total amount of exits was valued at $1.1 billion.</p><p>The average deal size in 2019 was around $124 million in 2019, 51% higher than the average deal size in 2018, excluding follow-on deals in both years, the report said. The share of large deals remained high in 2019; the total number of deals bigger than $100 million was 24, or 30% of all deals, compared to 17 deals, or 28% of all deals, in 2018.</p><p>In 2019, US investors accounted for almost 60% of the total number of deals, with 48 transactions, followed by European investors with 15% and Israeli investors with 14%. Asian firms accounted for 6% of the total, with Canada and Australia making up the remaining transactions.</p><p>\"Household names, including giants like Google, Samsung, Amazon and Palo-Alto, continued to shop for hot opportunities in the Startup Nation\" during 2019, said Yaron Weizenbluth, Hi-tech Partner at PwC Israel, commenting on the divs. \"The big tech firms were joined by buyers from diverse verticals, such as McDonald's, SolarWinds, Vimeo, Stryker and many others, which were also on the lookout for deep and complementary technologies.\"</p><p>Eyal Waldman, left, founder and CEO of Mellanox and Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of Nvidia Corp. at a press conference in Yokne'am, Israel on March 25, 2019 (Shoshanna Solomon/Times of Israel)</p><p>The computing and software sector continued to lead the exits in 2019, with total value of deals reaching $4.5 billion, an increase of 92% compared to 2018. Other sectors that showed \"significant growth\" were the internet sector, following the IPO of Fiverr International Ltd. in June, and the semiconductor sector, following the sale of Habana Labs to Intel Corp. earlier this month.</p><p>The Life Sciences sector was third in size for exits this year: total deal value of life science deals reached $1.69 billion in 2019, though this level was stagnant compared to 2018.</p><p>Yaron Weizenbluth, Hi-tech Partner at PwC Israel (Hagit Goren))</p><p>\"As the year is drawing to a close, it is fair to say that 2019 was outstanding for Israeli tech in terms of both deal numbers and value. In many respects, 2019 was an impressive feat and, by any measure, a fitting conclusion to a very successful decade,\" said Weizenbluth.</p><p>The IPO market also rebounded in 2019, \"after several relatively dry years, with three exceptionally strong IPOs on Nasdaq,\" he said.</p><p>These were the share sale of cybersecurity firm Tufin, the online marketplace Fiverr and medical equipment maker Inmode.</p><p>The year was also marked by a strong presence of $1 billion deals.</p><p>\"In recent years, we have become quite accustomed to having at least one 10-digit deal in the local market. And indeed, not less than five such deals were reported in 2019.\" Not all of these firms were included in this latest data, as some of the companies had already been acquired or went public in the past, and follow-on transactions, or secondary exits, are not included in the divs.</p><p>\"As we enter a new decade, it does not feel like the boom is about to end,\" said Weizenbluth. \"The 2020s are starting with a more supportive ecosystem for entrepreneurs that is stronger than ever. Add to that the evolution of Israeli entrepreneurs into players who are well versed in the global game and are confident in their ability to run long distances.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/28/157719007518.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/28/157719007518.jpeg</url></p><p>Illustrative image of a handshake (stnazkul; iStock by Getty Images)<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/51/157719007628.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/51/157719007628.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/53/157719007749.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/53/157719007749.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/66/157719007863.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/66/157719007863.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMISR-163036758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMISR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTK-KC81-JDJN-63FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428572</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Times of Israel.

Now, Congressional Democrats are offering up an Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, an expansive and ambitious new take on how to regulate automated decision-making. Whether or not it becomes law, it's a necessary effort to reassert human control as opaque algorithms take over bureaucratic processes.</p><p>Algorithms are being used everywhere: in credit decisions, mortgages, insurance rates, who gets a job, which kids get into college, and how long criminal defendants go to prison to name a few proliferating examples. Messy, complicated human decisions are being made, typically without an explanation or a chance to appeal, by artificial intelligence systems. They provide efficiency, profitability, and, often, a sense of scientific precision and authority.</p><p>The problem is that this authority has been bestowed too hastily. Algorithms are increasingly found to be making mistakes. Whether it's a sexist hiring algorithm developed by Amazon, conspiracy theories promoted by the Google search engine or an IBM facial-recognition program that didn't work nearly as well on black women as on white men, we've seen that large companies that pride themselves on their technical prowess are having trouble navigating this terrain.</p><p>And if that's what we know about, imagine what we don't. Most of the critically important algorithms in use have not been opened up for scrutiny, in large part because of laws protecting intellectual property.</p><p>The Democratic bill, introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives last week, would give the Federal Trade Commission power to require and monitor procedures by big companies to keep track of their algorithms and audit them for fairness and accuracy. It would apply only to companies with at least $50 million in annual revenue and would pertain even if intellectual property rights are involved, although it looks like the companies would have leeway in terms of whether they make the audits publicly available.</p><p>The idea is that obvious mistakes, or indeed subtle detours around existing anti-discrimination law, should be caught before they're embedded in computer programs for deployment. (To its credit, Amazon.com Inc. didn't use its sexist hiring algorithm.) Instead of assuming the best, in other words, companies will be required to provide evidence to the FTC that they follow relevant laws against discrimination. The inquiries would be done via third party auditors. (Disclosure: I run an algorithmic auditing company.) Companies would need to provide evidence that new algorithms are fair and accurate before being allowed to use them. This would be a huge step forward in terms of accountability, and is far from the case today.</p><p>Whatever the legislative fate of the Democratic bill, it's an indication of what is to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000016a-2cca-d251-a77e-3fca14a10000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX8-WB41-F06X-W1X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

But even as Trump signed that executive order in Washington, renewable energy advocates out West were doubling down on their efforts to clean up the power grid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At stake is the future of solar farms, wind turbines and coal plants across 11 western states, and a proposal from California<person><nameText>Gov. Jerry Brown </nameText></person>to bring them all under the umbrella of a unified power grid. Brown thinks a unified grid would bolster clean energy and reduce electricity rates, by making it easier for California to sell excess solar power to other states and import cheap wind power from Wyoming and New Mexico. But his plan has divided environmentalists, some of whom fear it would actually help the coal industry, or give Trump an opportunity to attack California's climate policies.</p><p>Many climate advocates support Brown's proposal. A coalition including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Silicon Valley tech companies and clean energy firms launched a new push for the governor's western grid plan Tuesday, urging Golden States lawmakers to authorize the expansion of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's electric grid.</p><p>Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of NRDC's energy program, said the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>backsliding on climate change makes it more important than ever for California to work with other states.</p><p>\"At a time when the Clean Power Plan is under threat, the fastest and cheapest way to enhance renewable energy across the West is full western grid integration,\" Cavanagh said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's something we can do regardless of federal policy to advance a clean energy expansion across the West that's already well underway.\"</p><p>But critics see Trump's love affair with fossil fuels as a reason to be wary of Brown's plan.</p><p>Expanding California's grid operator to encompass other western states would require a series of approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which should be controlled by Trump appointees within a few months. Critics are worried FERC would use that process to undermine California's climate policies, forcing the state to import dirty power from other parts of the West.</p><p>\"It's irresponsible and counter-productive to push for greater federal oversight of California energy policies,\" said Matthew Freedman, an attorney at the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based watchdog group that advocates for lower electricity rates and cleaner energy. \"It's surprising to hear a couple of groups get out front on this issue, especially on the same day President Trump announces a massive rollback of federal environmental regulations.\"</p><p>Trump attacks Obama's</p><p>climate legacy</p><p>In his executive order Tuesday, Trump called for the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rolling back Obama's Clean Power Plan, which is designed to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to start leasing coal on federal lands again. And he told federal officials they no longer have to factor climate change into their decisions.</p><p>Trump misleadingly claimed his actions would put coal miners back to work, even though the Clean Power Plan has been temporarily halted by the Supreme Court and thus hasn't taken effect yet. Obama's moratorium on new federal coal leases hasn't hurt the coal industry much, either. Experts say the biggest factor in the industry's recent struggles has been the low cost of natural gas.</p><p>\"The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods. They told me about the efforts to shut down their mines, their communities and their very way of life. I made them this promise: We will put our miners back to work,\" Trump said during an event at EPA headquarters, where he signed the executive order.</p><p>Without the Clean Power Plan, America would almost certainly fail to live up to the commitment it made at the Paris climate summit in 2015, when 195 nations agreed to limit global warming to manageable levels. The U.S. promised to cut its climate pollution at least 26 percent by 2025 - a target researchers have said we're on track to miss, even with the Clean Power Plan in place.</p><p>\"We need to speed up our response to climate change, because rising seas, drought, flooding and wildfires will affect everyone,\" said Mary Solecki, western states advocate for Environmental Entrepreneurs, a group of business leaders and investors that supports Jerry Brown's push for a unified western power grid.</p><p>Still, it could take Trump's lieutenants years to repeal the Clean Power Plan - and they may not succeed. The EPA must go through the arduous legal and scientific process of showing why Obama's regulation isn't needed, or should be replaced with a less stringent rule. And the agency's conclusions will inevitably face lawsuits from environmental groups.</p><p>Another complicating factor: In 2007, the Supreme Court said the EPA is obligated to regulate planet-warming greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, if the agency were to conclude that those emissions endanger public health. The EPA reached that conclusion after Obama took office. If Trump and his EPA administrator, <person><nameText>Scott Pruitt, </nameText></person>want to stop regulating greenhouse gases altogether, they'll need to reverse that \"endangerment finding\" - which could fly in the face of the overwhelming scientific consensus that human emissions are driving unprecedented, dangerous changes to Earth's climate.</p><p>California and the West</p><p>California's leaders have vowed to fight Trump's climate and energy policies. Brown sees a unified western grid as key to slashing emissions in California and across the West.</p><p>But with Trump in the White House, the politics of grid expansion might be too difficult to navigate.</p><p>Under Brown's grid proposal, the California Independent System Operator would start its expansion by annexing PacifiCorp, a Warren Buffett-owned utility with customers in Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and part of Northern California. Under that scenario, all six states would get some authority over the grid operator. But California lawmakers and some environmentalists are nervous about giving any amount of control to Utah and Wyoming, two deeply conservative states that harbor strong support for coal, oil and natural gas.</p><p>Brown wanted the state Legislature to approve his grid proposal in 2016, but top lawmakers balked. In a letter to Brown last year, Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n, Assembly leader Anthony Rendon and four committee chairs wrote that expanding California's electric grid \"must not undermine state sovereignty or cede authority of our state's cutting edge clean energy and climate policies.\"</p><p>Those concerns are even stronger now that Trump is president and could theoretically interfere, said Andrew Zingale, legislative director for Assemblymember Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo, who did not sign the letter.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem politically palatable,\" Zingale said in an interview last week.</p><p>Brown hoped to start the grid expansion with PacifiCorp so that California could more easily import cheap wind energy from Wyoming, which has some of the country's strongest onshore winds. PacifiCorp's leaders have been eager to link up with California's grid, seeing an opportunity to reduce their costs while also building lucrative power lines to transmit clean electricity to California.</p><p>But some grid expansion supporters have conceded that PacifiCorp and its red-state customers are a non-starter for California lawmakers. Instead, they're taking a broader approach, touting the potential benefits of a unified western grid and urging the Legislature to pass a bill allowing the California Independent system operator to annex out-of-state utilities.</p><p>\"Had you not had PacifiCorp raising their hand and saying, 'We want to join,' you wouldn't have started with PacifiCorp. You would have started with someone closer, and frankly, more politically aligned,\" said Don Furman, a former PacifiCorp executive who now advocates for grid expansion through a coalition of environmental groups and energy companies called Fix the Grid West.</p><p>Strong opposition remains</p><p>Furman suggested California could instead partner with utilities in environmentally minded Oregon and Washington, or with NV Energy, another Warren Buffett-owned utility that covers much of Nevada. Abundant hydropower in the Pacific Northwest, Furman said, could help power California when solar plants go offline in the evening, reducing the state's need for polluting gas plants.</p><p>\"To be able to pull on (Washington's) Columbia River for a few hours would be really, really helpful,\" he said.</p><p>If California were to unify the western United States' 35 separate electric grids, Golden State homes and businesses would save $1.5 billion annually on their electric bills by 2030, according to a study commissioned by the grid operator. Reduced energy costs would lead to the creation of 19,300 jobs in California, even as some clean energy jobs move out of state, the study found.</p><p>Those numbers help explain why some business leaders are now pushing for grid expansion.</p><p>\"Done right, big tech companies to local solar panel installers to small farms in the Central Valley would benefit from a fully integrated grid,\" Tim McRae, vice president for energy at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group - which represents companies including Apple, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft - said during Tuesday's conference call.</p><p>Critics disagree.</p><p>Some labor economists have questioned the alleged benefits to California, saying the loss of high-paying renewable energy jobs to other states would outweigh whatever job growth is spurred by lower electricity rates. And California's politically powerful labor unions have staunchly opposed grid expansion, not wanting to see jobs building solar and wind farms shipped to other states.</p><p>The Sierra Club, America's largest environmental group, also isn't convinced that grid expansion is a good idea. Club leaders worry that opening the California electricity market to coal plants in Utah and Wyoming might inadvertently prolong the lifetime of those facilities, allowing them to keep spewing climate-altering greenhouse gases - and other dangerous pollutants - for decades.</p><p>Kathryn Phillips, director of the Sierra Club's California chapter, said it doesn't make sense for the state Legislature to pass a bill allowing the grid operator to expand as it sees fit, as NRDC and other environmentalists have proposed. Instead, California leaders should carefully study which out-of-state utilities it would make sense to partner with, then write legislation specific to those utilities.</p><p>\"In theory, you would think Washington, Oregon, possibly Nevada - these states seem to be on a trajectory to move away from coal, and to increase their renewable portfolio. They seem to share some of the values California has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Phillips said. \"But what you really need to do before you hop into a situation with them is really analyze them.\"</p><p>A surplus of</p><p>solar power</p><p>Over the last decade, California has enacted some of the nation's most ambitious climate policies, including a renewable energy mandate, a cap-and-trade system to limit industrial emissions and financial incentives for clean cars. De Le\u00f3n, the state Senate leader, introduced a bill last month that would increase the clean energy mandate from 50 percent by 2030 to 100 percent by 2045.</p><p>But even with those policies, meeting the state's long-term climate goal - slashing emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 - won't be easy.</p><p>Already, California is facing a new challenge: a surplus of renewable energy during the middle of the day, when solar farms have increasingly flooded the grid with more energy than homes and businesses are using. The California Independent System Operator said recently it may have to \"curtail,\" or turn away, as much 8,000 megawatts of power at times this spring, most of it solar.</p><p>Supporters of Brown's western grid plan say California could solve that problem by sharing more electricity with other states. Solar farms could sell energy across state lines rather than shutting down when there isn't enough in-state demand. And California utilities could import wind power from places like Wyoming, to help balance out fluctuations from in-state solar and wind farms.</p><p>Cavanagh, from the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the grid operator's recent prediction of up to 8,000 megawatts of curtailment a \"wake-up call.\"</p><p>\"California shouldn't be shutting down clean energy from our solar fields and wind farms every time supply exceeds our state's demand,\" he said.</p><p>Still, California's \"too much solar\" problem is far from a crisis at this point. And it's not clear how much a unified western grid would help. Studies commissioned by the independent system operator found that a fully integrated grid would decrease the percentage of renewable energy production California is forced to curtail in 2030, but only slightly - from 4.5 percent to 1.2 percent.</p><p>And even that estimate might be too optimistic. Under an alternate \"base case\" modeled by the private consultants who conducted the study, California would only have to turn away 2 percent of renewable energy production by 2030, even without expanding its power grid. And that \"base case\" is the one that's more likely to occur, according to comments submitted to the grid operator by all three of the state's major utilities.</p><p>\"Reducing curtailment is good, but it's not the end of the world that renewables are getting curtailed a few percent of the hours of the year,\" said Freedman, from the Utility Reform Network. \"You're using a small problem to propose a radical set of changes.\"</p><p>Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even among so-called unicorns \u2014 private startups worth $1 billion or more \u2014 de facto monopolies are already the norm. As technology writer Om Malik argued in The New Yorker recently, \"Most competition in Silicon Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.\" Airbnb dominates the apartment rental market, Snapchat is the big player in ephemeral messaging, and Spotify stands out as the major streaming music library. And when it comes to on-demand ride services, Uber, the most valuable private company in the world, is the clear leader.</p><h>BODY</h><p>But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn't stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.</p><p>On Monday, Lyft raised an additional $1 billion from investors including General Motors, increasing its total fundraising to $2 billion. At the same time, it announced it was developing software for self-driving cars and teaming up with GM to put more drivers on the road. These moves are part of Lyft's bid to distinguish itself and avoid being muscled aside by the runaway market leader, an all-too-common experience for technology companies.</p><p>\"We're gaining share in the United States,\" said John Zimmer, Lyft's president and co-founder. \"That's not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\"</p><p>Regardless of whether Lyft and Uber can both thrive, or if there is only one big winner in the booming ride-hailing industry, dominance in and of itself is not illegal. Problems arise only when a company \"unreasonably restrains competition\" or gains and holds power \"through improper conduct,\" according to the Federal Trade Commission's definition of monopolization.</p><p>Indeed, there is a line of thinking that celebrates monopolies. In a unanimous decision from 2004, the Supreme Court said the ability to create a monopoly was a powerful incentive that should be protected.</p><p>\"The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \"The opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts 'business acumen' in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\"</p><p>Nor have regulators been cracking down in Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against high-tech giants.</p><p>\"This is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\" Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.</p><p>Unlike US Steel or Standard Oil, two of history's biggest brutes, today's tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.</p><p>Network effects helped Google, Facebook, and Amazon run away from their competitors and are helping Uber today. Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social network, and Amazon wasn't the first to sell goods online. There are still myriad other sites for search, social, and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to Google and Facebook.</p><p>Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.</p><p>The underlying problem here is that antitrust regulators are only looking at consumer welfare,\" Reich said. \"They aren't looking at the long-term potential for total dominance of a network, the possibility of predatory behavior once a technology giant becomes entrenched, or political power.\" (European antitrust laws are more expansive than those in the United States, resulting in continuing actions against Google and other big tech companies.)</p><p>Along with network effects, another hallmark of today's tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving cars division, and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><p>This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of startups and venture capital, it isn't easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, argues that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android, and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.</p><p>\"Once one of these companies gets a monopoly, it's easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\" Reback said. \"You would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\"</p><p>While monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.</p><p>\"Sun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\" said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \"Then the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\"</p><p>And of course, billions of people browse the Web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Although no upstarts have replaced them yet, they are not immune to disruption.</p><p>As for Uber, if it's not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt, and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)</p><p>As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users.</p><p>\"Just like AT&amp;T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\" he said, \"we get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there's no difference in behavior between services. That's when you compete on experience.\"</p><p>While a company like Uber might take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, might still have room to profit and even prosper.</p><p>Should that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft might become something competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-e5b31bd0-b669-11e5-900b-83cd1c4abfdb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HTN-JKN1-DYHJ-32DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 10, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, directed at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, didn't include the kind of fiery rhetoric dominating headlines these days. In fact, it stopped well short of calling for (or even hinting at) the breakup of the social media company and its big tech brethren - as some top Democratshave recently startedto do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it may still prove to be an important step forward in the debate.</p><p>Innocuous as the letter may seem at first glance, Crapo and Brown make what could be critical inroads. They press the company about its plans to launch a cryptocurrency payments system, the collection of any consumer financial information and data it might have that would inform credit decisions. They also raise the issue of whether Facebook should be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. (Neither the lawmakers nor Facebook responded to a request for comment.)</p><p>The question now is whether the committee leaders view the letter as the start of a larger discussion around big tech's forays into banking - or as more of a one-off fact-finding mission. That remains to be seen, though observers stress that it's going to be an issue to watch.</p><p>\"It's quite important - if Crapo and Brown want to make it important,\" said Brandon Barford, a partner at Beacon Policy Advisors. \"They're asking good questions, so it's a matter of how far they want to push it and how much political capital they want to spend.\"</p><p>Following are three questions to consider as this debate heats up.</p><p>What do regulators think?</p><p>Barford notes that the lawmakers have several options for how they could pursue further action against Facebook: They could tackle the issue head-on through legislation or put pressure on regulators to take a bigger role in policing the social media company and other big tech firms.</p><p>As luck would have it, the heads of the primary banking agencies are slated to testify before the committee on Wednesday, providing an opportunity for lawmakers to potentially press regulators on their views.</p><p>\"It's a good opportunity to bring it up,\" Barford said.</p><p>Can the effort remain bipartisan?</p><p>Crapo and Brown have repeatedly worked together on these issues - starting in February with a public request for information on the use and protection of sensitive information by financial regulators and private companies.</p><p>Notably, the lawmakers' opening statements at a hearing on privacy held last week each cited this collaboration. Such remarks \"suggest they maintain a keen interest in working together to influence the current debates over privacy and data collection legislation,\" said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the federal consumer program at U.S. PIRG.</p><p>With Congress divided, any stricter actions taken against the big tech firms - including their use of financial data - will need support across both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Will the inquiry fuel broader debate?</p><p>The Crapo-Brown letter is likely to expand what's known about Facebook's data collection practices, which could help spur interest in federal privacy legislation.</p><p>\"I don't know that this will be a significant catalyst - but there is a fairly good chunk of hay on the camel's back building up to that point,\" said Sam Taussig, head of global policy at the online lender Kabbage, which focuses on loans to small businesses.</p><p>He noted that it will be particularly important to see how the social media giant responds to questions about what consumer information ithas obtained from financial companies- and how lawmakers react to that disclosure.</p><p>\"That's a huge sticking point,\" said Taussig. \"We need to encourage a national framework that gives individuals complete ownership over their financial data.\"</p><p>Solving the debate over privacy - and what to do about the vast access big tech companies have to consumer information - isn't likely to be a quick fix. But the Banking Committee's letter has no doubt put Facebook on notice, and could suggest there's more progress on the way.</p><p>That is, if Crapo and Brown decide to pick up the mantle.</p><p>Bankshot is American Banker's column for real-time analysis of today's news.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016a-b2f3-d2dc-a57b-bef3ede30000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3S-4YX1-JCRW-500N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

It's\u00a0Friday, February 10th, and we're talking tech, and\u00a0desperately vying for Gaby Lapera's\u00a0approval. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,\u00a0and I'm joined in the studio by Fool.com\u00a0tech editor, Sarah Priestley, and the host of the Financials show, Gaby Lapera. So, Gaby,\u00a0pretty awesome to have you on the show. I haven't done --\u00a0I don't know if Sarah has --\u00a0anything with you before. Do you want to give people a little background on why you're here?</p><p>Gaby Lapera: Yes. My name is Gaby Lapera,\u00a0and I don't own any stocks. This is where you say, \"Hi, Gaby!\"\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Hi, Gaby. This is your\u00a0confessional?</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0I don't own any stocks,\u00a0and that's kind of pathetic for someone who has worked at The Motley Fool\u00a0for a whole year and a half,\u00a0almost two years, a year and three quarters. So,\u00a0I made it my New Year's resolution to buy five stocks,\u00a0one for each sector Industry Focus. Originally, I was going to talk to you guys off the air, and be like, \"Educate me about your sector.\" But then\u00a0we decided, why not do it live? So here we are. But I want to remind our listeners that\u00a0this is not personal advice for me. Dylan is not going to say, \"Hey Gaby,\u00a0I know you like to slack off at work,\u00a0so I'm pitching you\u00a0Facebook.\"</p><p>Lewis: That\u00a0would totally make\u00a0sense, though. And, yes, I am picking you, Facebook.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: So,\u00a0this is more just, stocks that they like,\u00a0potentially that they already own,\u00a0and they think that everyone should have a little think about. This isn't personal advice for you,\u00a0because Dylan probably doesn't know you. Maybe he does, probably not.</p><p>Lewis: Probably not.</p><p>Lapera: Sarah might know you. She knows more people.</p><p>Sarah Priestley: Potentially.</p><p>Lewis: Sarah\u00a0has her eyes everywhere.\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: Yeah, so,\u00a0keep in mind, no personal advice. We also have some disclosure stuff that\u00a0if you have listened to every other show this week,\u00a0you can probably fast-forward the next 15 to 30 seconds while\u00a0I tell you about it, because it's the same stuff you've heard on\u00a0every show this week so far. The\u00a0Motley Fool has a disclosure policy,\u00a0and we must publicly disclose if a contributor has an\u00a0interest in any of the stocks mentioned,\u00a0which is any of us on the show. Additionally, Fool employees\u00a0work under trading restrictions. We must hold stocks for at least 10 days,\u00a0because we are not about that day-trading life. We also cannot write about a stock in the period of two market days before to two market days\u00a0after purchasing or selling the stock,\u00a0which means that no one on this show has purchased or sold any stocks that we're\u00a0going to talk about today. Not a shock for me because I haven't bought any stocks yet. But very good on you guys for exercising self-control.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: One of the things,\u00a0before we get into the stock discussion, that\u00a0I thought was really great about this week --\u00a0I don't know if you listen to the episode I did with Michael Douglass about New Year's resolutions,\u00a0but we talked about the idea of having an accountability buddy on your resolutions. You, whether you realize it or not --</p><p>Lapera: I have 10.</p><p>Lewis: Ten, yeah. So,\u00a0that was an expertly crafted resolution by you,\u00a0because you basically outsourced\u00a0all of the motivation to other people.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0Oh, no,\u00a0I am an expert at that. That's management tier.</p><p>Lewis: So, if you're struggling to set up your resolutions\u00a0even now or you're wondering how to get them done, take notes from Gaby Lapera, who\u00a0managed to rope in 10 people\u00a0to help her out with her stock buying decisions for 2017.</p><p>Lapera: I'm just very well liked around the office.</p><p>Lewis: I guess so. This is going to be a fun show. I think the idea of doing a theme week and\u00a0having analysts pitch stuff is really awesome. To get us started,\u00a0I think Sarah is going to go first in talking about\u00a0Shopify.</p><p>Priestley: Yeah.\u00a0I am very bullish, like a lot of Fools here, on\u00a0Shopify. I would like to give you a little bit of background about the company and\u00a0tell you what they do.\u00a0I apologize if you already know.</p><p>Lapera: No,\u00a0I don't actually. Tell me what they do.</p><p>Priestley: Shopify IPO'd in 2015 for $1.27 billion. Their current market cap is $4.9 billion, so,\u00a0still pretty small. The\u00a0company was founded in\u00a02006 by Tobias L\u00fctke . I think that's how you say his name. I'm very sorry if that's not how you say his name.</p><p>Lewis: That sounds right.</p><p>Priestley: So,\u00a0he is now chairman and CEO,\u00a0but originally the company was founded as a snowboarding company. But\u00a0they found they couldn't find any\u00a0online store software that would work for small\u00a0companies at the time. You're talking around 2004, remember if we can. It was all for big companies that wanted to\u00a0establish an online\u00a0presence. There was nothing that was custom to\u00a0small companies. So, they discovered this glaring hole in the e-commerce market, and they believed that future businesses will be\u00a0created online\u00a0and almost online only. And obviously,\u00a0that was pretty futuristic of them. That's exactly what we have now,\u00a0if you look at\u00a0Etsy\u00a0and a lot of other companies. So, in 2006, they launched Shopify. L\u00fctke\u00a0described Shopify as the only platform\u00a0you need to build your empire. I would say, given their offerings,\u00a0that's pretty true. The company has\u00a0325,000 merchants\u00a0currently using their platform. There's mostly small and medium businesses, but there's some bigger names that you'll\u00a0recognize. There's some\u00a0Amazon\u00a0web stores,\u00a0Tesla,\u00a0Johnny Cupcakes... Does anybody know them?</p><p>Lewis: The Boston chain? Yes! I know Johnny Cupcakes,\u00a0having spent five years in Boston.</p><p>Lapera: Thatsounds like a mob member.</p><p>Lewis: Well, they're T-shirts, but also, it's kind of a cupcake place, too? It's\u00a0something like that.</p><p>Priestley: I know the way that they present their T-shirts\u00a0is that they wrap them\u00a0and they give them to you in a cupcake box,\u00a0which I think is pretty cool. If they do cupcakes,\u00a0I will definitely sample them, too.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Yeah,\u00a0that's a very popular joint on either Boylston or Newbury Street, but one of the main shopping strips in Boston.\u00a0I don't know if they have any other locations.</p><p>Priestley: I'm there next weekend.\u00a0I'll check it out.</p><p>Lapera: I'm not kidding. Johnny Cupcakes sounds like someone who will whack you.</p><p>Lewis: We'll\u00a0take you out through the back, go see Johnny Cupcakes.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0Wikipedia Shop also uses them, and the\u00a0Los Angeles Lakers. But the important thing\u00a0with this is that when you go\u00a0on to these sites,\u00a0you would not know that you are using the Shopify\u00a0platform, and that's completely\u00a0deliberate. Shopify says, \"Our job is to make our merchants look their very best in\u00a0every interaction they have with their customers,\" and\u00a0I would say that's completely true. When you go on their sites,\u00a0you have no idea. It's not branded with Shopify. They're giving merchants\u00a0everything that they need behind the scenes.</p><p>So,\u00a0what do they actually do? It's a cloud-based platform\u00a0and it allows customers to add to the functionality that they need to sell on\u00a0multiple platforms, so, web, mobile,\u00a0social media, Facebook,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Pinterest, and even physical retail locations. They offer\u00a0analytics in real time, and they really offer a\u00a0plethora of things, but I'll just touch on a few. Sales analytics by channel and customer,\u00a0Inventory management,\u00a0discount and gift cards,\u00a0order processing, customer management --\u00a0so, this is really data tilling to better understand your customer\u00a0preferences and build relationships -- and,\u00a0importantly, payment processing. In the U.S.,\u00a0Canada, the U.K., and Australia, that's\u00a0fully integrated with their platform. Think\u00a0PayPal,\u00a0Square, those kinds of\u00a0companies. And where it's not available, or the company has a\u00a0preferred payment processing partner like\u00a0Visa, which\u00a0I'm sure you're very familiar with, the\u00a0platform connects with those payment gateways seamlessly.\u00a0</p><p>You can\u00a0do it all by yourself if you're a merchant. You can set up online. Desktop and mobile,\u00a0they have 150 customizable storefront\u00a0designs, and they are optimized for SEO and social media. They also serve\u00a0physical locations with point of sale. You get all the same\u00a0integration with all\u00a0of the analytics that you would if it was online. So, yeah,\u00a0they make it super easy for you to operate as a small to medium business and grow to be a huge business, too.</p><p>Lapera: That was,\u00a0I think, one of the most coherent stock pitches that I have\u00a0received.</p><p>Lewis: I really regret letting Sarah go first.</p><p>Priestley: You're\u00a0being too nice.</p><p>Lapera: Do\u00a0you want to tell me about your company? I don't know if I need to hear about it, but...\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: [laughs] Before we get into my pitch on Facebook,\u00a0why don't we talk a little bit about some of the things that Sarah likes about Shopify?</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0The crux of\u00a0my argument on Shopify is basically that\u00a0it's a really comprehensive platform. So,\u00a0you can grow from being a tiny start-up to a multi-billion -- no, multi-million.\u00a0I'm pretty sure they don't have any billion dollar companies on there yet. But, they\u00a0completely offer everything, and that\u00a0cradle to grave functionality is incredibly rare, and I would say that is,\u00a0probably, their biggest competitive advantage. The company is yet unprofitable,\u00a0and that's something that you really need to bear in mind. If you invest in them, you're\u00a0investing in their growth story. They intend to grow in two ways --\u00a0that's to grow the number of merchants that they serve, and to\u00a0grow the amount of revenue that those merchants transact.\u00a0</p><p>The last one is long-term\u00a0instrumental to their success\u00a0because it's symbiotic. If they can offer their merchants this full suite of products to\u00a0make them successful, their ecosystem\u00a0becomes super sticky,\u00a0the customers are unlikely to leave. And as they grow, Shopify grows,\u00a0which is the perfect recipe. So,\u00a0L\u00fctke is\u00a0aware of this, and he frequently references investments to help merchants sell better. You often hear this, \"meet\u00a0merchants where they are\" or \"meet customers where they are.\" This is the\u00a0definition of this. He says they have launched\u00a0Apple Pay, [...] Messenger,\u00a0and a brand-new Shopify app that lets merchants set up and run their\u00a0entire business from their mobile phone. And\u00a0this is what they've done recently. So,\u00a0all these investments are to\u00a0bolster the offering,\u00a0continually, that they have for their customers, and to\u00a0stay ahead of the game.\u00a0</p><p>And\u00a0as far as the opportunity to grow their base, their\u00a0addressable market is absolutely phenomenal. According to a 2014 survey --\u00a0that sounds outdated, but it's the most comprehensive recent study --\u00a0there were 47 million small-to-medium businesses globally, and 10 million\u00a0operate in Shopify's core markets. So, bear in mind,\u00a0they have a little over 325,000 merchants right now. That is a tiny fraction of their potential market, in a really growing space. The e-commerce space grew 11% in the first half of 2016. Experts estimate that in just\u00a0the holiday season, e-commerce is going to grow by 11% to almost $100 billion.</p><p>Lapera: That's crazy.\u00a0I saw a study the other day saying that for every $4 spent in\u00a0America, $1 is spent on Amazon in America.</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0Amazon is the top dog in this arena, and Shopify is, I guess, a\u00a0competitor for them, even though they share some similarities.</p><p>Lewis: And\u00a0actually, for\u00a0as much as we think about e-commerce\u00a0being pretty ubiquitous\u00a0and something that we interact with all the time --\u00a0I mean, I order stuff off of Amazon all the time -- its\u00a0penetration is actually fairly low,\u00a0especially worldwide. I think it's\u00a0somewhere in the single digits or very low double digits. This is still, in a lot of ways, a trend that has a huge runway.</p><p>Priestley: It really does. And I feel like we're in the kind of cycle where small-to-medium\u00a0businesses are being empowered,\u00a0people are focusing on craft. If you look, Etsy, Pinterest, and those kinds of small\u00a0organizations that are really fostering individual entrepreneurs, it's all working\u00a0together. And I really feel like\u00a0Shopify has the platform,\u00a0as you can see,\u00a0Tesla\u00a0has their storefront with them, they can go all the way through the\u00a0spectrum of different business sizes. So, personally,\u00a0I think that what they offer is really compelling. And they increased their\u00a0number of merchants 60% year over year last quarter,\u00a0so obviously there's a lot of people that agree. Their\u00a0merchandise volume 100% increase\u00a0year over year. They're making some\u00a0fantastic momentum.</p><p>Lapera: Are there problems, Sarah? Tell me the truth.</p><p>Priestley: There are problems.</p><p>Lewis: You\u00a0want to talk problems now? Or\u00a0do you want to talk problems at the end?</p><p>Priestley: I can talk problems at the end. I want to give you your moment in the light.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: All right.\u00a0Gaby, second half of the show.</p><p>Lapera:I'm ready.</p><p>Lewis: It is\u00a0my turn to wow you. I don't know if you've ever heard of this company...</p><p>Lapera: [laughs] OK.</p><p>Lewis: ... it's\u00a0Facebook. Formerly The Facebook.\u00a0[laughs] But I'm guessing that you and many of our listeners are\u00a0fairly familiar. For anyone who isn't,\u00a0Facebook is basically the umbrella company for\u00a0a bunch of different social platforms.\u00a0Facebook, their namesake one,\u00a0being the main one,\u00a0but also Instagram,\u00a0Facebook Messenger,\u00a0another one of their main properties, and\u00a0WhatsApp. So, really,\u00a0this is a company that's looking to connect to people, build\u00a0online engagement, create these communities and\u00a0platforms where people can exchange content,\u00a0exchange ideas, connect with each other. They\u00a0finance all of that through advertisements. That's how they make the bulk of their money. So,\u00a0if you want to look at how the numbers break down for them,\u00a0advertising makes up 98% of the company's revenue\u00a0as of the most recent closed quarter\u00a0earlier this month. Within that, mobile makes up 84% of that revenue, and that's up 80% year over year. To give you an idea of the growth rate --\u00a0because this is a business that's kind of in a little bit of a different phase than\u00a0Shopify -- they are, at this point, just under a $400 billion market cap company. Shopify, for comparison, is a $5 billion market cap company. Facebook posted Q4 year-over-year growth, revenuewise, of 51%, and on EPS (earnings per share), was 124% growth.</p><p>Lapera: That's incredible. So,\u00a0Warren Buffett --\u00a0oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing this.</p><p>Lewis: Do it!</p><p>Lapera: I complained about, on\u00a0every single show, someone said something about Warren Buffett, and now it's me.</p><p>Lewis: I heard you do that, so I intentionally wanted to leave him out of this discussion. Not that\u00a0he would ever invest in Facebook.</p><p>Lapera: (groans) See,\u00a0I love Warren Buffett. He's a nice guy. He actually lives in\u00a0Nebraska. I lived near him at one point.</p><p>Lewis: You guys were\u00a0practically neighbors.</p><p>Lapera: I drove past his house one time. But, no,\u00a0Warren Buffett, one of the things that he talks about is,\u00a0when a company gets really big,\u00a0it's really hard for them to post astronomical growth. And\u00a0that's pretty astronomical growth\u00a0for a company that's really big already.</p><p>Lewis: Yes. Those are gaudy growth rates,\u00a0and I think in the future, those will come down\u00a0a little bit. We can talk about some of the reasons for that\u00a0a little bit later on. But a lot of the reasons that I really like them as a company is\u00a0in spite of the fact that they are already a $400 billion market cap company,\u00a0roughly, they have a ton of growth coming their way, and there's\u00a0a lot to really like with their business. So,\u00a0I mentioned the revenue and EPS growth. But,\u00a0if you look at their namesake platform, last quarter Facebook recorded 1.86 billion monthly active users,\u00a01.23 billion daily active users. That's good for\u00a017% and 18% increase year over year. So, think about the denominators that those are increasing on,\u00a0it's kind of crazy. Also, to put the number in context, there's about\u00a07 billion people in the world, about\u00a0half of them have access to the internet, and\u00a0about half of those people are on Facebook monthly.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0We\u00a0also tape the shows\u00a0on video, if you ever want to see what we look like, Dylan's\u00a0eyes are twinkling right now.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Yes.\u00a0I get excited.\u00a0[laughs] But,\u00a0the point with that is, what really drives a business for them is\u00a0users coming onto the platform, so growing that user base,\u00a0and having them spend more time on the platform,\u00a0because those two metrics allow them to have more ads\u00a0appear in people's feeds. So, when you see a\u00a0business that already has a user base in the billions still adding more\u00a0at a double-digit clip,\u00a0I think that's pretty impressive. If you want to look at some of the growth opportunities for them with users,\u00a0I think there's still some pretty big potential in the Asia-Pacific and\u00a0rest of world regions. Most\u00a0recently, those were up 25% and 19% year over year. So,\u00a0a lot to like there. I will caution that,\u00a0in terms of the average revenue per user for those regions, or the value of those users, the strongest markets adwise are U.S.,\u00a0Europe, and Canada,\u00a0because the consumer buying power is the strongest there,\u00a0so the ad rates are commensurate with that. So, those\u00a0might not necessarily be\u00a0the same value in average revenue per user, but there's still a very long runway in a\u00a0lot of those markets.</p><p>Beyond Facebook's core platform, though,\u00a0one of the other reasons I really like the business is the scope of their properties and\u00a0some of the opportunities that that opens up for them.\u00a0I mentioned that they have\u00a0Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and\u00a0Instagram. Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger all have over a billion\u00a0monthly active users. Instagram has over 500 million\u00a0monthly active users. And a lot of those platforms\u00a0benefit from what we call in tech the\u00a0network effect. I don't know if this is something you're familiar with, Gaby,\u00a0but the idea is, as\u00a0each property grows, the value proposition\u00a0for that property to users is\u00a0stronger, and it's more compelling to non-users. So,\u00a0if I'm on Facebook and Sarah is on Facebook and we're two\u00a0best friends, you're probably going to want to join Facebook.</p><p>Lapera: Sure.</p><p>Lewis: Right?</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0That's true,\u00a0that's how I ended up on Facebook,\u00a0that's exactly what happened.</p><p>Lewis: If\u00a0that's how we're all communicating, if that's how we're all posting pictures. Exactly,\u00a0you just get sucked into it. That's something that you enjoy when you have those critical masses of users\u00a0like they have on all these different platforms. Something to be kind of excited about is, when we\u00a0look at the company's financials here, really,\u00a0Facebook and Instagram are the two properties that they monetize. So,\u00a0I think we are more or less at full monetization with Facebook. There will be growth, naturally, with user base growth. But\u00a0in terms of ad load, we're kind of\u00a0at the saturation point there. Instagram, they're\u00a0still rolling stuff out. There's still some ramp there. But with WhatsApp and Messenger, they're\u00a0still in really early days. And those are properties that have, combined, 1.5 billion\u00a0monthly active users. So, if they can crack that nut and\u00a0understand how to monetize those users effectively,\u00a0I think the growth runway is fairly long for those other\u00a0properties. So, I think that's something to like.\u00a0</p><p>The\u00a0last thing that I really love with this business is they're managed in a very Foolish way.\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's management really likes to think with a three- to 10-year\u00a0outlook and approach. They're very good in their\u00a0quarterly calls about keeping investors in the loop about what the priorities are for that roadmap. Most\u00a0recently, they talked a little bit about three years,\u00a0looking to improve and expand the community they have continue to grow users, and\u00a0continue to double down on\u00a0pushes like live video,\u00a0things that will engage people in their feeds,\u00a0get people to come to the platform\u00a0and interact with them more. Five years out,\u00a0the main priorities, and,\u00a0over the next five years is how you can think about that, Messenger and WhatsApp\u00a0monetization,\u00a0doing some more work with video and search,\u00a0things like that. And more broadly, in 10 years,\u00a0I don't know if you've heard about internet.org,\u00a0it's a\u00a0non-profit that's largely funded by Facebook. That whole\u00a0non-profit is aimed at growing\u00a0access to the internet worldwide. Like\u00a0I mentioned before, there's about three billion\u00a0people that have access to the internet of seven billion\u00a0in the world. Obviously, there's a lot of benevolence to\u00a0wanting to make the entire world access the internet\u00a0and have all the information and agency that enables. As\u00a0those people come online, there's\u00a0also the element of, well,\u00a0they're probably going to be fairly familiar with Facebook. So, the 10-year plan for them is to\u00a0continue to grow access to the internet and bring those people into their ecosystem as they do. Some of the\u00a0other stuff that they're targeting,\u00a0which is a little bit farther afield from their\u00a0current businesses but could be really interesting down the road, is\u00a0investments in artificial intelligence. Right now, a lot of that is being used to tailor their news feeds and really\u00a0provide people with the content that's most relevant to them. Then, they've made some\u00a0splashes into virtual reality. I don't know if you heard about the acquisition of\u00a0Oculus a couple years ago?\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: No.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Well,\u00a0it's a little different than what they typically do,\u00a0getting into hardware and virtual reality. I think the market there isn't\u00a0nearly as clear, and\u00a0it's not really certain what the opportunity will be, or what\u00a0adoption might be for consumers. But that's another field that they're playing in. With\u00a0all of this long-term thinking, at the end of the day,\u00a0it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's show to run. The\u00a0company and management has been very clear in\u00a0setting themselves up so that he will\u00a0maintain his controlling stake in Facebook. A little while back, they\u00a0announced that they wanted to do at 3:1 stock split. What that will basically do is give\u00a0existing shareholders two class C shares for every A and B they own. The class Cs will be non-voting, and\u00a0Zuckerberg will be able to give away, via his\u00a0charitable efforts, the C shares, and maintain his super-voting B shares and control of the company. So,\u00a0you have a management that thinks long-term, and you have the\u00a0corporate set up where they are going to be able to continue to think long-term without really\u00a0having to worry about any major shareholder coming in and pushing them around. So,\u00a0I really like that as well.</p><p>I've been\u00a0talking quite a bit,\u00a0so I think maybe, it might be time for us to\u00a0open this up a little bit, talk\u00a0concerns or any questions that you may have\u00a0about some of these businesses.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0I have questions. I have so many questions. And if you guys think of any questions for each other while I'm talking,\u00a0feel free to jump into the fray.\u00a0I think it gets boring when one person talks for a really long time.</p><p>Lewis: Yes,\u00a0I can take a hint.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: [laughs] But, no. Sarah, Shopify versus Etsy, can you explain the difference to me?</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0Etsy is a\u00a0marketplace platform. Think abouteBay, but more specifically niche to\u00a0crafts\u00a0and things like that. So, essentially, you rent a store or you have a store, and they\u00a0take a percentage of the transaction. This is completely different\u00a0in the sense that Shopify is\u00a0what you would have if you wanted to have your own brand.</p><p>Lapera: So, you're\u00a0hosting your own content.</p><p>Priestley: You're\u00a0hosting all of your own content, it keeps you\u00a0complete control, you can track your sales, you get\u00a0all of that back-end facility, and it's the payment processing, too, which\u00a0is actually kind of tricky for companies to establish by themselves. There's a lot of fintech\u00a0companies coming into the space now, as we know, as you know\u00a0probably better than us. But, yeah,\u00a0that's probably one of the key things the company offers.</p><p>Lewis: And,\u00a0actually, on that point,\u00a0I think there might be a lot of people who test out early concepts for craft-oriented businesses or niche businesses within Etsy, and then realize that there's traction there, and then switch over to a Shopify\u00a0because the offering is stronger and they want to be able to build themselves out in their\u00a0internet presence.</p><p>Priestley: The\u00a0other thing that Shopify does is they have a buy button.\u00a0I don't know if you use Pinterest or Etsy, but there's a buy button, even on Twitter. And\u00a0Shopify embeds those, and that's another thing that they offer.</p><p>Lapera: Another question: Does\u00a0Shopify take a percentage of the sales, or are they just making money on\u00a0licensing fees?</p><p>Priestley: No,\u00a0they take a percentage of the sales. That\u00a0transaction volume, they're\u00a0taking a cut of the transaction volume.</p><p>Lewis: So,\u00a0that's a business that scales as the customers succeed,\u00a0which is nice. You have the growth of acquiring new vendors,\u00a0but you also have, as those vendors scale\u00a0and become increasingly larger businesses, them enjoying the business success as well.</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0That's the merchant solutions revenue. That's fees from sales, and that was up 115% last quarter.</p><p>Lapera: Last question:\u00a0Remind me of someone, a customer, that uses Shopify.</p><p>Priestley: Tesla.</p><p>Lapera: Tesla.</p><p>Lewis: Gaby is punching Tesla into her computer.</p><p>Lapera: I am looking them up. There's a shop button,\u00a0which I just clicked on. You can buy a very sexy leather jacket and\u00a0charging accessories.</p><p>Lewis: It's\u00a0pretty slick.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0I would have no idea that Tesla didn't make this themselves.</p><p>Priestley: Absolutely,\u00a0and that's the whole point. The whole point is, they're empowering merchants. And they're really\u00a0making it hard to leave,\u00a0because it would be difficult for customers to move away and\u00a0replicate that exactly as it was before.</p><p>Lapera: That\u00a0interesting. I wouldn't have expected Tesla to rely on a third party. It's\u00a0not like they don't have the tech expertise to make it themselves.</p><p>Priestley: Yeah, but it can save companies a huge amount. One of the reasons that\u00a0Shopify is unprofitable is stock-based\u00a0compensation. The reason that a lot of tech\u00a0companies use stock-based compensation\u00a0is because they don't have much money at the time, and they use it to attract talent. And\u00a0a lot of that talent is developers and tech people. So, if\u00a0anybody out there is about to make their college choices,\u00a0think carefully about the tech space. So, yes,\u00a0that's one of the things that use, and\u00a0if a company can outsource, essentially. And\u00a0it really is pretty idiot-proof. I mean, bless him, my husband set up --\u00a0[laughs] no, I'm kidding. He's very intelligent. But\u00a0it's a very easy platform to use. And if they don't have to hire somebody to do that, that's a cost saving on that point.</p><p>Lewis: Shopify's\u00a0tag line could be \"let us do the share-based compensation for you.\"\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Priestley: [laughs] It really could be.</p><p>Lapera: That's\u00a0really funny. I had\u00a0dinner with a friend last night, and she was saying that she has been offered a job where\u00a0a lot of it is share-based compensation, and it's for a company that hasn't had an IPO yet. And it's like, \"Well? What do you do there?\"</p><p>Lewis: Do you like their prospects?</p><p>Lapera: I don't know. I think it's actually a company\u00a0that you have probably talked about.\u00a0Uber.</p><p>Lewis: Interesting. We will couch that for another episode.</p><p>Lapera: Anyway. I mean,\u00a0we could do a personal finance crossover episode, Should You Accept A Job With Share-Based Compensation?</p><p>Lewis: It could be something for Motley Fool Answers.</p><p>Lapera: That\u00a0would be a great idea. Questions for you now. Unless you have any questions for Sarah?</p><p>Lewis: No,\u00a0I'm not going to cross-examine her.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: You said\u00a098% of the company's revenue comes from ads. Is that a problem with people\u00a0increasingly using ad blockers?</p><p>Lewis: It\u00a0depends. When you look at\u00a0desktop traffic, yes. That said, a\u00a0very small portion of internet browsers use ad blockers. But I personally use Adblock Plus, so\u00a0a lot of ads that would be popping in,\u00a0whether they be through\u00a0Google\u00a0or through Facebook, don't appear. But,\u00a0when we're talking mobile and the shift to mobile, and\u00a0I talked about how 80% of their ad revenue was coming in via\u00a0mobile at this point, because people are\u00a0coming to Facebook on mobile via the Facebook app, that is a walled garden that mobile ad blockers cannot get into. So,\u00a0that is not something that is impacting most of that traffic. And\u00a0because general consumer trends are pushing that way,\u00a0it's not something that I'm super worried about.</p><p>Lapera: Interesting.\u00a0I had not thought about\u00a0mobile ad blocking it all. I'm not sure how that would work in the ecosystem of your phone.\u00a0I do have a question about, you talked about them expanding, how they only have a seventh of the world's population using their platform. But there are countries where there is no Facebook. China,\u00a0for example, they have their own social media platforms. Do you think that would be a problem in any other setting for their\u00a0expansion? Do you think they would just buy those companies?</p><p>Lewis: No,\u00a0I think that's a legitimate risk. One of the things that,\u00a0in addition to these regional upstarts that we have, the idea of\u00a0demographic shifts\u00a0maybe pushing people out of Facebook,\u00a0or having them not come in to Facebook, is\u00a0something that I'm a little worried about. I think about how, Facebook has been in the U.S. for 10 years at this point. In the tech world, that's an\u00a0eternity. That's a long time. You think about how you\u00a0might have looked at\u00a0Myspace\u00a0or something back in the day and been like, \"Ah, I'm not a part of that,\" and instead gone to Facebook. I think there's the risk\u00a0not only internationally of their being\u00a0more entrenched platforms\u00a0that are specific to certain countries, maybe, and have really great traction there, but I'm\u00a0a little bit more worried about\u00a0people that are coming onto the internet now, younger folks, maybe early teens,\u00a0looking at the offerings that are out there in the social networking world and instead deciding to go with maybe Snapchat, rather than going to Facebook, because they see Facebook as this old, dowdy --</p><p>Lapera: It's an old person thing.</p><p>Lewis: -- internet relic. Like, \"Oh,\u00a0my parents are on Facebook, I don't want to be on Facebook.\"</p><p>Lapera: My\u00a0grandma is on Facebook.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Both my parents are on Facebook.\u00a0I'm not friends with my dad. Interesting.\u00a0[laughs] But one of the things I'm really excited about with that is, Snap will be going public. So,\u00a0we will be getting some color on their business and\u00a0customer acquisitions,\u00a0hopefully. You can watch those two track each other. To\u00a0mitigate some of that, Facebook has been\u00a0pretty good recently about bringing in Snapchat-style functionality.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0Like Facebook Live, right?</p><p>Lewis: Kind of.</p><p>Lapera: Is that a thing?</p><p>Lewis: Facebook Live is a thing.</p><p>Lapera: I've\u00a0seen\u00a0that advertise on bus shelters.</p><p>Lewis: Yes. They are\u00a0pushing that like crazy. But the Snapchat-style functionality of\u00a0stories and little posts and\u00a0things like that that are disappearing, that is...\u00a0</p><p>Priestley: [laughs] Who does that remind us of? I don't know...</p><p>Lewis: [laughs] Yeah, right? That is being\u00a0brought to the Instagram and Facebook Messenger platforms. So, I think they're seeing what resonates with people and bringing it there as a point to attract them to these platforms. That was a roundabout way of answering your question.</p><p>Lapera: No, that was a really good answer. That\u00a0made me think about things that I hadn't thought about before, so I really appreciate that. My\u00a0last question is actually about internet regulation. This is for whoever wants to answer it,\u00a0I guess, but you made me think of it\u00a0when you were talking about the 10-year plan to\u00a0get more people on the internet. In the past and likely again, there have been bills that talked about\u00a0internet throttling and stuff. That could be a problem for online businesses. What do you see? Do you see\u00a0potential future regulations as a problem? Do you think we're moving away from that as a society? This is a touchy-feely question, I know,\u00a0but I'm interested in hearing your opinions on this.</p><p>Lewis: When\u00a0I think about regulation and Facebook's 10 year plan, I tend to focus on the net\u00a0neutrality side of the internet.org offering.</p><p>Lapera: Do you\u00a0want to explain net neutrality really quick? It's\u00a0complicated.</p><p>Lewis: Absolutely. Net\u00a0neutrality is basically a free and open internet,\u00a0and the idea that people are not getting restricted versions of the internet, or\u00a0censored versions of the internet. Some of the\u00a0push back that Facebook has met with in India\u00a0when they were trying to roll out internet.org there and\u00a0build out connectivity is, the suite that is part of internet.org is basically, you have access to these\u00a0at the time, it was like 30 or 40 platforms, and they were a mix of\u00a0messaging, social networking, job hunting, news,\u00a0that kind of stuff. But it was a curated package of all these\u00a0different internet properties. And the\u00a0regulatory push back they got was, \"Well, that's not the internet. That is a hand-picked\u00a0version of the internet. If people come online and see that, they might confuse\u00a0Facebook for the internet, and that's it. And they might not realize that there's\u00a0all of this indexed world out there that they can explore,\u00a0and it might lend itself to some monopolistic forces.\" I think, with the big tech pushes from Facebook, andAlphabet\u00a0is\u00a0getting into this as well, the\u00a0benefits from having more of the world connected\u00a0probably outweigh the\u00a0competitive risks of having it being pushed by major tech titans that have an interest in staying entrenched in that space. I think those will\u00a0probably win out. They might have to do it in a watered-down way that gives people more access generally. But\u00a0I'm more worried about the net neutrality side of stuff than internet throttling, if that makes sense.</p><p>Lapera: No,\u00a0that's totally fine. It's an\u00a0interesting thing. And every time it has come up recently, it has been defeated. But\u00a0there's a new administration, we'll see what happens.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0And the\u00a0domestic side of that is a whole nother host of issues. We could spend a whole episode on that.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lapera: There you go. Do you have\u00a0anything you'd like to say about that?</p><p>Priestley: No,\u00a0I completely agree. It's\u00a0interesting because\u00a0back home in the U.K., there's\u00a0a lot of companies threatening to leave because\u00a0the actual internet infrastructure isn't as good as they would like. So,\u00a0you have those issues, too, which\u00a0I realize is separate from that big macro issue. But, I would say the U.S. is in a\u00a0particularly good place with the wireless and online\u00a0infrastructure.</p><p>Lapera: Yeah,\u00a0it was wild, I studied abroad in Australia for a few months, and this was many years ago, many many moons. It was wild\u00a0because here, there was wifi on campus everywhere, and you paid one set amount and you had\u00a0access to the internet. And sure, you could pay more for faster speeds. But there, you\u00a0literally paid for how much data you used. The more data you wanted to use, the more you had to pay. Here, it's the faster, the more you pay, but they don't put a cap on your data, in theory, for your computer internet. It's interesting.\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: And\u00a0not to plug Facebook again in this conversation --</p><p>Priestley: You know,\u00a0I feel like you're getting a lot more airtime.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Speak up, then.\u00a0[laughs] But with the focus on mobile, and that being where\u00a0a lot of their revenue is coming from,\u00a0most people first come online,\u00a0in a lot of developing areas, via\u00a0mobile devices and not desktop.</p><p>Lapera: Which do have data caps.</p><p>Lewis: Which do have\u00a0data caps. But there's also data caps and\u00a0very often wifi connectivity. So, you have two ways to approach. That's\u00a0another thing to think about. Anything you're\u00a0worried about with Shopify, Sarah?</p><p>Priestley: Yes. As I said,\u00a0I'll be really quick about it, but the big thing to bear in mind, and\u00a0obviously, we always encourage everybody to do their own background and stuff,\u00a0but the company is not profitable. They lost $9.5 million\u00a0in the third quarter\u00a0despite making really healthy gross margins. They had 79% on their\u00a0subscription business,\u00a026.5% on the merchant solutions,\u00a0but a negative net margin of 10%. We're $27 million last year to date. And\u00a0the reason for that is SG&amp;A, which is sales, general, and administrative costs and stock based compensation. I will say, SG&amp;A is trending down as a\u00a0percentage of revenue. It was 84% in 2012, it was 58% in\u00a02015. I will caveat that by saying that\u00a02016 is probably going to trend up slightly. Again, stock based\u00a0compensation, we've already talked about it. It's regular, it's a usual thing to see for these high-growth tech companies. But\u00a0we are starting to see some companies pull back\u00a0especially in the cyber security sector and things like that. So, it's\u00a0something to be mindful of. Liquidity, they're carrying debt. I wouldn't worry about their debt ratio. In terms of valuation,\u00a0obviously, they don't have any earnings, so\u00a0traditional metrics like P/E, we can't use, but price-to-sales is 13, and it's 3.9 average for software and\u00a0services. If you take Square, which we referenced, I don't know\u00a0how familiar you are, but it's kind of a similar payment processing, theirs is 10. So, it's not crazy, but you're going to pay a premium for the growth story here.</p><p>But,\u00a0the bottom line is, it's exactly what you're paying for, it's\u00a0potential growth. And honestly, Dylan, you've made\u00a0such a compelling argument for Facebook. They\u00a0really do have a lot more growth left in them,\u00a0and it's a safer, more stable long-term bet. I honestly believe that this has a long way to go because I think the\u00a0platform is just so compelling, and there's\u00a0so many more entrepreneurs coming onto the market,\u00a0there's a lot of innovative solutions that are being developed. Even it could\u00a0convince large companies to switch to its platform, too. So, yeah, that's my pitch. Bear in mind the fact that they're not profitable, so valuing them is tricky, and you really have to convince yourself about the stewardship and the growth story.</p><p>Lapera: OK.\u00a0I know that I'm going to go home and check on their debt, because I'm wild about debt. It's\u00a0just a side effect of having been on the Financials show so long, but I'm just like, what is it? What's the interest rate? In what form is it? I want to know.\u00a0[laughs] But,\u00a0I'm not going to\u00a0pelt those questions at you.\u00a0I do have a question, though, which is, do you own Shopify?</p><p>Priestley: No. But I will soon.</p><p>Lewis: It's on Sarah's watch list.</p><p>Priestley: It's\u00a0on my watch list. It's kind of pricey right now.\u00a0I think it's $50 a share. It's been on a bit of a tear. My\u00a0personal expectation\u00a0for this next quarter is that the SG&amp;A is going to track up slightly, and I'm wondering if that's going to have an effect on the share price. They report next week at\u00a0the end of the week. I am going to buy shares, because I believe they have a lot of potential. I would love a low entry point, but we shall see what happens.</p><p>Lapera: Same\u00a0question for you. Do you own Facebook?</p><p>Lewis: I do. Michael Douglass and I did an episode\u00a0about two or three weeks ago\u00a0talking about Facebook in depth,\u00a0and after the necessary compliance period ended,\u00a0I bought shares because I had convinced myself of buying shares. And\u00a0I had to be very careful in planning this show and that show to make sure that I was in a window where I was in the clear. In the\u00a0interest of painting a full picture here,\u00a0there are some other concerns that I have\u00a0in addition to some of the other demographic stuff with Facebook,\u00a0and I think it's worth mentioning. As\u00a0I talked about before, that 50% growth rate is\u00a0super appealing for their top line. Management has guided that that is\u00a0going to come down considerably in 2017. One of the main reasons for that is, ad load has more or less reached full saturation\u00a0on the Facebook feed itself. So,\u00a0that's one of the main drivers of that. So,\u00a0I don't know exactly what that's going to look like, but\u00a0don't expect the company to continue to be growing 50% year over year. It might drop down into the mid 30s, I'm not 100% sure. They're\u00a0not a very guidance-oriented business,\u00a0so it's a little tough to peg. But given some of the other opportunities, even if what goes on with Facebook itself is kind of\u00a0relatively steady state, I like the story there.\u00a0</p><p>Some of the other risks to consider with monetizing Messenger and monetizing WhatsApp, they're both messaging apps. And the way that user\u00a0interact with the messaging app is\u00a0fundamentally different than the way someone goes to Facebook or Instagram. Those are both feed-based content styles where\u00a0people are naturally going to be scrolling down their phone, and in-line ads\u00a0are a very natural part of the user experience. So, they've done\u00a0a great job monetizing platforms in the past. A lot of people doubted that they were going to be able to make mobile work, and that's why they traded down in the 15s at one point. But the\u00a0messaging apps are a slightly different animal,\u00a0and it's going to provide a unique challenge to management\u00a0in order for them to really monetize it. So,\u00a0I think that's another risk to be mindful of.</p><p>Lapera: Fair enough.\u00a0I think that we're running pretty long.</p><p>Lewis: Long episode.</p><p>Lapera: Long episode.\u00a0I think it's time to wrap up. As I said, listeners,\u00a0I'm going to go home and do some research on all the companies I've heard about this week, and\u00a0I'll talk about what\u00a0I've decided to buy eventually, once I can buy it.</p><p>Lewis: No rush. Do your research.</p><p>Lapera: No rush,\u00a0exactly. It\u00a0takes me a year to find the perfect pocket knife.\u00a0I can't even imagine how long it's going to take me to decide on stocks that people have already done about 70% of\u00a0the work for me on.\u00a0[laughs] But, no,\u00a0I do have one question which I've asked everyone on the show so far, which is,\u00a0if you could give one piece of advice\u00a0to a beginning investor, what would it be?</p><p>Priestley: Read earnings calls. I think it\u00a0gives you a really good flavor of the management. There's\u00a0no better way to thoroughly understand the business and how competent a lot of the people in senior leadership are.</p><p>Lapera: That's\u00a0absolutely true. There's been a few times that I've read earnings transcripts, and I'm just like, \"Man, that guy sounds sketchy,\"\u00a0and then a few months later some scandal happens and I'm like, I knew, because I read their earnings transcript.</p><p>Priestley:\u00a0When you're in tune like that, definitely read the earnings calls.</p><p>Lewis: Wow. Expert\u00a0judge of character. Who knew? I think my advice, similar to Sarah's,\u00a0in the idea of understanding what's going on with the business. But\u00a0don't just look at the number and cite the number. Understand the forces that play into the number, and what might be causing it. So, you get a lot of that color from the commentary on the conference calls. But, early on, when\u00a0people are learning to invest, you'll see them and be like, \"Oh! This is the P/E, so it's undervalued!\" And I think that, really,\u00a0you want to understand all the mechanics at play, and what's driving the business,\u00a0because you get a much better sense of\u00a0what's going on that way.</p><p>Lapera: Got it. So\u00a0it's not just understanding\u00a0what the ratio means,\u00a0although that's very important, it's\u00a0understanding what's driving the ratio, and understanding the ratio in context.</p><p>Priestley: The\u00a0context of the industry is probably the biggest thing I learned when I started.</p><p>Lapera:\u00a0Well,\u00a0thank you guys so much. This has been a very,\u00a0very substantial conversation.\u00a0[laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis: Are you wiped after doing\u00a0five episodes this week?</p><p>Lapera: Super wiped.\u00a0But I was really pumped when I came into the studio and discovered Munchkins, the little donuts.</p><p>Lewis: Gotta love Chris Hill/hate him.</p><p>Lapera: The blueberry ones are the best. I know it's a super-fake blueberry taste,\u00a0and I'm really into that.</p><p>Lewis: Are there any left in the box?</p><p>Lapera: Oh my God, yeah!</p><p>Lewis: Gaby shakes the box. I think, at this point, we can wrap the show?</p><p>Lapera: Probably. Do you want to do it, or should I?</p><p>Lewis: I'll take us home.\u00a0Well,\u00a0listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

It has undertaken a 16-month public relations spectacle, designed to convince us that we want what it's selling for Quayside and the Port Lands district of Toronto. But cities aren't products, they're political constructs built in the public interest. Now - in the face of global threats such as climate change and ever-growing numbers of displaced people - it is vital that we bolster the power of local government to address these challenges, not diminish it, disrespect it, or cede it.The Port Lands are enormous; the last major parcel of undeveloped land in the city's core. There has long been global interest in the area, but it requires environmental remediation and lacks basic infrastructure; the governments' priorities have slowed the development process down. In the wake of the recent &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/14/googles-sidewalk-labs-plans-massive-expansion-to-waterfront-vision.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/14/googles-sidewalk-labs-plans-massive-expansion-to-waterfront-vision.html</url>\"&gt;Toronto Star expos\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; about Sidewalk Labs' plans and its ideas for financing infrastructure - plans that may include the company collecting a share of municipal tax revenue in the future - some residents are saying: Well, why not?</p><p> If government isn't building transit or funding infrastructure fast enough, why shouldn't this company be given the chance to do so?While frustration with government may be legitimately acute, the answer is not to sign off on corporate capture of government and the people it is designed to serve. Though we live in an era of political cynicism, city governments enjoy the highest level of public trust. The Sidewalk Toronto project reflects contempt for civic engagement, urban planning, and democratic rights when we need exactly the opposite.&lt;strong&gt;Opposing view:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate/2019/02/26/is-sidewalk-labs-going-too-far-in-the-port-lands-no.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate/2019/02/26/is-sidewalk-labs-going-too-far-in-the-port-lands-no.html</url>\"&gt;Is Sidewalk Labs going too far in the Port Lands? No&lt;/a&gt;Sidewalk Labs isn't just relying on utopian architectural renderings of new construction to entice us: they are selling us fear. Fear that our government will fail us yet again. Fear that if this company doesn't do it, nobody will.But this is smoke and mirrors. Canadians just committed $1.2 billion to rehabilitate the mouth of the Don River and protect the Port Lands from flooding - a big hurdle to building new neighbourhoods there. And there are hundreds of firms, both locally and globally, that would bid on a range of the projects that are being considered in the Port Lands if they were given the chance.Why were discussions about Quayside, which should only happen between government and residents, up for sale to Sidewalk Labs? And why was it decided that Quayside could be used as a keystone to indirectly access much larger legacy lands? Yes, there are reasons that certain technologies and infrastructure must be considered at scale, but this process weaponized ambiguity to the detriment of a clear and accessible public narrative about what this project was about, including the business model and the actors involved. Corporations shouldn't run public consultations.There are rules around lobbying to protect influence in government; where are the rules to prevent this confusion of democratic process? It's the same approach that Google uses in technology markets: identify areas where there aren't strong regulatory regimes and exploit them. This is called regulatory capture, a specialty of big tech.Torontonians never asked to become part of a high-tech test-bed, to house an experiment where corporations have a blanket capacity to collect significant amounts of data as a matter of course.&lt;strong&gt;THE BIG DEBATE: &lt;/strong&gt;For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate.html</url>\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.Due to a poorly structured RFP, a proposal for one was accepted, adding a whole new kind of risk. Toronto lacks policies to ensure democratic fairness where digital and physical spaces converge. We're vulnerable.Sidewalk's CEO, Daniel Doctoroff, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/02/19/sidewalk-labs-we-werent-trying-to-do-anything-in-secret.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/02/19/sidewalk-labs-we-werent-trying-to-do-anything-in-secret.html</url>\"&gt;is fond of saying&lt;/a&gt; that the company will be a \"catalyst\" for developing the Port Lands. But it is residents and government that are the catalysts. If we want tall timber buildings and other low-carbon features for the precinct, include them in the next procurement. Sidewalk Labs isn't presenting us with a bold vision; it's making a bold power grab.We don't need Sidewalk Labs. We need to believe in local government and in its role in democratic society. Once it's gone we won't get it back. Normalizing this project is setting a dangerous precedent for democracy, one that should end and end now. &lt;span class=\"endnote_contrib\"&gt;Bianca Wylie is a data governance advocate and the co-founder of Tech Reset Canada.&lt;/span&gt;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019022653601485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHD-WMJ1-JDH1-C15S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

It has undertaken a 16-month public relations spectacle, designed to convince us that we want what it's selling for Quayside and the Port Lands district of Toronto. But cities aren't products, they're political constructs built in the public interest. Now - in the face of global threats such as climate change and ever-growing numbers of displaced people - it is vital that we bolster the power of local government to address these challenges, not diminish it, disrespect it, or cede it.The Port Lands are enormous; the last major parcel of undeveloped land in the city's core. There has long been global interest in the area, but it requires environmental remediation and lacks basic infrastructure; the governments' priorities have slowed the development process down. In the wake of the recent &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/14/googles-sidewalk-labs-plans-massive-expansion-to-waterfront-vision.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/14/googles-sidewalk-labs-plans-massive-expansion-to-waterfront-vision.html</url>\"&gt;Toronto Star expos\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; about Sidewalk Labs' plans and its ideas for financing infrastructure - plans that may include the company collecting a share of municipal tax revenue in the future - some residents are saying: Well, why not?</p><p> If government isn't building transit or funding infrastructure fast enough, why shouldn't this company be given the chance to do so?While frustration with government may be legitimately acute, the answer is not to sign off on corporate capture of government and the people it is designed to serve. Though we live in an era of political cynicism, city governments enjoy the highest level of public trust. The Sidewalk Toronto project reflects contempt for civic engagement, urban planning, and democratic rights when we need exactly the opposite.&lt;strong&gt;Opposing view:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate/2019/02/26/is-sidewalk-labs-going-too-far-in-the-port-lands-no.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate/2019/02/26/is-sidewalk-labs-going-too-far-in-the-port-lands-no.html</url>\"&gt;Is Sidewalk Labs going too far in the Port Lands? No&lt;/a&gt;Sidewalk Labs isn't just relying on utopian architectural renderings of new construction to entice us: they are selling us fear. Fear that our government will fail us yet again. Fear that if this company doesn't do it, nobody will.But this is smoke and mirrors. Canadians just committed $1.2 billion to rehabilitate the mouth of the Don River and protect the Port Lands from flooding - a big hurdle to building new neighbourhoods there. And there are hundreds of firms, both locally and globally, that would bid on a range of the projects that are being considered in the Port Lands if they were given the chance.Why were discussions about Quayside, which should only happen between government and residents, up for sale to Sidewalk Labs? And why was it decided that Quayside could be used as a keystone to indirectly access much larger legacy lands? Yes, there are reasons that certain technologies and infrastructure must be considered at scale, but this process weaponized ambiguity to the detriment of a clear and accessible public narrative about what this project was about, including the business model and the actors involved. Corporations shouldn't run public consultations.There are rules around lobbying to protect influence in government; where are the rules to prevent this confusion of democratic process? It's the same approach that Google uses in technology markets: identify areas where there aren't strong regulatory regimes and exploit them. This is called regulatory capture, a specialty of big tech.Torontonians never asked to become part of a high-tech test-bed, to house an experiment where corporations have a blanket capacity to collect significant amounts of data as a matter of course.&lt;strong&gt;THE BIG DEBATE: &lt;/strong&gt;For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/thebigdebate.html</url>\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.Due to a poorly structured RFP, a proposal for one was accepted, adding a whole new kind of risk. Toronto lacks policies to ensure democratic fairness where digital and physical spaces converge. We're vulnerable.Sidewalk's CEO, Daniel Doctoroff, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/02/19/sidewalk-labs-we-werent-trying-to-do-anything-in-secret.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/02/19/sidewalk-labs-we-werent-trying-to-do-anything-in-secret.html</url>\"&gt;is fond of saying&lt;/a&gt; that the company will be a \"catalyst\" for developing the Port Lands. But it is residents and government that are the catalysts. If we want tall timber buildings and other low-carbon features for the precinct, include them in the next procurement. Sidewalk Labs isn't presenting us with a bold vision; it's making a bold power grab.We don't need Sidewalk Labs. We need to believe in local government and in its role in democratic society. Once it's gone we won't get it back. Normalizing this project is setting a dangerous precedent for democracy, one that should end and end now. &lt;span class=\"endnote_contrib\"&gt;Bianca Wylie is a data governance advocate and the co-founder of Tech Reset Canada.&lt;/span&gt;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019022653603778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHD-WMJ1-JDH1-C16V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

In the spring of 2016, they found something that seemed to be proof of that suspicion. Six months before the presidential election, technology news website Gizmodo published a scoop: News curators at Facebook, one former such curator alleged, suppressed stories from right-leaning outlets, in what amounted to a \"chilling effect\" on conservative media.</p><p>In response to the outcry, <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/facebook-fires-human-editors-algorithm-immediately-posts-fake-news/\">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/facebook-fires-human-editors-algorithm-immediately-posts-fake-news/</url>Facebook dumped its human editors, who had the power to either extend or curtail the reach of any news item. Within days,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-trending-news-editors-fake-news-stories\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-trending-news-editors-fake-news-stories</url> the network was overwhelmed by a surge of fake news, precisely the kind that human editors were supposed to filter out. An algorithm might have a difficult time figuring out whether Hillary Clinton had once worked to free Black Panthers charged with murder. But a human editor would have needed perhaps 30 seconds to confirm       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-panthers/\">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-panthers/</url> that she had not--and that allowing the story to trend would be a public disservice.</p><p>This was a critical change. Facebook is the world's most popular social media platform, one that serves as a news outlet for 45 percent of American adults, according to the Pew Research Center. Now, just 74 days before the presidential election, Facebook had radically reconfigured what its audience would read.</p><p>While the true impact of fake news on the election remains in dispute, millions of Americans undoubtedly saw fake news on Facebook, like the following viral article from a sham outlet calling itself Denver Guardian: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE.\"</p><p>More than a year later, the Facebook affair remains a key moment in the politicization of social media. To liberals, it signaled Silicon Valley's excessive deference, not only to conservatives but to extreme right-wing personalities and their views. By declaring themselves impartial platforms, many on the left say, social media companies have forsaken their responsibility to the public. \"It's now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bullshit,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2016/11/facebook-employees-rip-zuckerberg-he-knew-fake-news-we-pushed-ran-wild-during-the-election/\">https://www.rawstory.com/2016/11/facebook-employees-rip-zuckerberg-he-knew-fake-news-we-pushed-ran-wild-during-the-election/</url> a former Facebook employee wrote (on Facebook) on Election Day 2016.</p><p>Though conservatives seemingly won the Facebook battle--and Donald Trump's tweets now demand a journalistic beat of their own--the right remains convinced that the tech companies we now rely on for news are fundamentally hostile to its convictions. If Facebook was guilty of bias in 2016, the thinking goes, so are denizens of every significant tech campus in Sunnyvale and Cupertino.</p><p>The case against Silicon Valley has been building since the election. Alleged culprits include Twitter, which the anti-abortion group Live Action criticized last summer for blocking pro-life advertisements as \"sensitive content\" (Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/27/twitter-suppresses-messages-criticizing-planned-pa/\">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/27/twitter-suppresses-messages-criticizing-planned-pa/</url> denied targeting Live Action); Airbnb, which several weeks later canceled accounts associated with the \"Unite the Right\" white nationalist rally last August in Charlottesville, Virginia; and Google, which one study said \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/09/08/a-method-of-google-search-bias-quantification-and-its-application-in-climate-debate-and-general-political-discourse/\">https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/09/08/a-method-of-google-search-bias-quantification-and-its-application-in-climate-debate-and-general-political-discourse/</url> downranks\" conservative websites, a practice Google vigorously       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/google-responds-to-report-claiming-search-result-are-biased-against-conservative-sites-199616/\">https://www.christianpost.com/news/google-responds-to-report-claiming-search-result-are-biased-against-conservative-sites-199616/</url> denied.</p><p>The prevailing mood of victimhood has led some conservatives to conclude they need to create their own Silicon Valley, one where MAGA T-shirts won't elicit terrified mockery. \"The world needs social media platforms that are genuinely free. Or even that tilt in a conservative, pro-Christian direction,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://stream.org/social-media-conservatives-christians\">https://stream.org/social-media-conservatives-christians</url>/ urged conservative writer John Zmirak after Live Action went public with its complaints about Twitter. \"Think of the difference that Fox News made to U.S. politics. We need something comparable as a social media platform, before we find ourselves muzzled outright.\"</p><p>Others on the right are increasingly acceding to that view. That much was clear at February's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Hours after the keynote address by Trump, a small but attentive audience gathered for a panel titled \"Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\" A young man passed out baseball hats adorned with the logo of Twitter, only the blue bird was upside down, an \"x\" where its eye should have been.</p><p>The audience was a mix of reporters from the mainstream media and fringe personalities who, through the use of social media, have become celebrities in a right-wing media ecosystem that prizes loyalty to Trump and the trolling of liberals as prime journalistic virtues. Their newfound fame has, in turn, allowed them to criticize the same platforms that made them famous...for bias. There was Jack Posobiec, a self-styled investigator who used Twitter and Periscope, the video-streaming service, to promulgate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.fbc4786f6b3f\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.fbc4786f6b3f</url> the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which accused the Clinton campaign of running a child sex-trafficking operation out of a Washington, D.C., restaurant. There was Lucian Wintrich, an improbable, dapper White House correspondent for conspiratorial pro-Trump outlet Gateway Pundit, recently criticized for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-is-gateway-pundit-the-conspiracy-hawking-site-at-the-center-of-the-bogus-florida-crisis-actors-hype/2018/02/23/dded562a-174e-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921_story.html?utm_term=.b61c97750214\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-is-gateway-pundit-the-conspiracy-hawking-site-at-the-center-of-the-bogus-florida-crisis-actors-hype/2018/02/23/dded562a-174e-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921_story.html?utm_term=.b61c97750214</url> inventing rumors about survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. And there was Cassandra Fairbanks, the heavily tattooed pro-Trump journalist formerly employed by Russian propaganda site Sputnik.</p><p>The talk that followed--some lamentation, some j'accuse, many grim warnings, not much humor--was a succession of testimonies against Silicon Valley, along with some acknowledgement that quitting its world-changing products is almost impossible. It seemed perfectly timed, coinciding with several new developments that made the topic angry and urgent, a scab demanding to be picked.</p><p>Just days before CPAC began, Twitter undertook <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/conservative-twitter-users-lose-thousands-of-followers-1823185428\">https://gizmodo.com/conservative-twitter-users-lose-thousands-of-followers-1823185428</url> what Gizmodo called \"a mass purge of suspected Russian bot accounts.\" The move was taken to curb the proliferation of these accounts, which are believed to have influenced the 2016 presidential election by spreading misinformation. But the right, once rife with cold warriors, complained about the move (on Twitter), since the #TwitterLockout appeared to mostly affect the accounts of conservatives. Those who lost followers included white nationalist Richard Spencer and gun activist Dan Bongino.</p><p>Around the same time, YouTube, which is owned by Google, moved to shutter popular channels as part of its enforcement effort against fake news and \"harmful or dangerous\" content, including those affiliated with Infowars, the pro-Trump conspiracy site run by Alex Jones. YouTube has apologized <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/youtube-s-new-moderators-mistakenly-pull-right-wing-channels\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/youtube-s-new-moderators-mistakenly-pull-right-wing-channels</url> for what it called \"mistaken removals\" and restored the channels. This passed for a tacit concession of the difficult position in which conservatives have put Big Tech by treating every attempt to monitor digital activity as an attempt to silence the right.</p><p>A profound sense of injury accordingly informed the CPAC panel, a feeling that Silicon Valley has become as hostile to conservatives as the studios of Hollywood and the newsrooms of Manhattan are. \"They are targeting people for ideological reasons,\" said lead speaker James O'Keefe. He's made a career of this suspicion, which he has applied to any institution with even a whiff of liberalism about its halls.</p><p>During his talk, O'Keefe presented a covertly recorded video (his modus operandi) of a Twitter holiday party. There, his investigators found one woman who works on the \"trust &amp; safety\" team. \"We're trying not to get the shitty people to show up\" on Twitter, she says, referencing pro-Trump journalist and conservative activist Mike Cernovich, who during the presidential election spread misinformation about Clinton's health. (Cernovich also dabbled in Pizzagate, though he has recently moved closer to the political and journalistic mainstream.) The quip about \"shitty people\" may have been jarring, but it could not have been especially surprising, since Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey often laments how toxic discourse on the platform has become.</p><p>David Carroll, a media analyst at the Parsons School of Design in New York City, says concerns about liberal bias in Silicon Valley are vastly exaggerated. \"Tech platform algorithms seem designed for equal opportunity attention and engagement: If it plays it pays,\" he says. While advertisers may be concerned about the content of a particular political site out of \"brand safety issues,\" he adds, this is only \"the free market and freedom of speech at work.\"</p><p>Concrete evidence of bias may not exist, but that doesn't stop many on the right from imagining an Oberlin graduate lounging in a beanbag, gazing out over the hills of Palo Alto as she happily relegates Breitbart News articles to oblivion. \"Conservatives worry that more human moderation will lead to censoring of content,\" says Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher at Data &amp; Society, a digital culture think tank partly funded by Microsoft. \"But right now, there is no evidence or auditing process to know who, what or how platform companies are moderating in relation to partisan content.\"</p><p>Skeptical conservatives point to the case of Google's James Damore as proof of an institutionalized intolerance of the right. Google, of course, is a corporation and does not need to answer to anyone but its shareholders. Executives there saw fit to dismiss Damore last summer for his <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf\">https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf</url> infamous memo, which declared--among other widely disputed assertions--that women were psychologically ill-equipped for certain leadership positions. \"To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,\" wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the time.</p><p>This reaction bothered Terry Schilling, head of the conservative American Principles Project and moderator of the CPAC social media panel. \"The left is contradicting themselves,\" he said in a subsequent conversation. He brought up the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission case, now before the Supreme Court, in which a gay Colorado couple sued a baker who claimed his Christian convictions prevented him from making them a custom wedding cake. Masterpiece is often cited by liberals as an example of religious intolerance; Schilling argues that Google and its peers show exactly the same intolerance toward conservatives like Damore.</p><p>Schilling also suggested the tech company had borrowed some social behaviors from college campuses, where safe spaces and trigger warnings abound, and where Trumpism is as welcome as a mandatory math course. Damore made that connection even more explicitly during his CPAC talk. \"Most tech workers are young, straight out of college,\" he claimed. \"They've lived in liberal bubbles their entire life.\" And, he maintained, \"this bubble is reinforced when they just move to San Francisco.\" He said Google executives \"cried onstage\" after Trump's election.</p><p>Part of the problem is that nobody really knows how much to regulate tech, or who should do the regulating. Conservatives have traditionally espoused a laissez-faire approach to business, promising to cut taxes and regulations, and railing against what they call onerous workplace protections for protected groups like women and people of color. But in their approach to Silicon Valley, government was suddenly the solution, not the problem. After he was fired, Damore lodged a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, founded during the New Deal and frequently derided by the right as a group of activist bureaucrats. Despite being run by Trump appointees, the board upheld Google's decision to fire Damore.</p><p>At the same time, Silicon Valley may be just as ideologically opposed to the right as those other bastions of coastal elitism, Manhattan and Hollywood. Harmeet Dhillon, a prominent Republican operative in San Francisco who is representing Damore, laid out the case. According to records she has obtained in the course of suing Google, there are 74,000 employees at Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Of these, 39 contributed to the Trump campaign. Google employees gave Hillary Clinton's campaign a total of $1,559,861 while lavishing $40,813 on fringe Green Party candidate Jill Stein. That's nearly double what they gave to the man who would eventually become president: $24,423. \"You're more likely to die by being shot than to be a Google employee that's contributed to Republican Party candidates,\" Dhillon said. While the statistics aren't incontrovertible proof of anti-right bias (many Republicans didn't support Trump either), they certainly don't bolster the case that Silicon Valley is a nonpartisan technocracy.</p><p>Yet she could not definitively prove that a bias among tech employees has translated into a bias within Silicon Valley's offerings. While conservatives complain about censorship, they have generally failed to acknowledge that right-wing sites are far more likely to promulgate fake news than liberal ones, as the Oxford Internet Institute, part of the British university, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-02-06-trump-supporters-and-extreme-right-share-widest-range-junk-news\">http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-02-06-trump-supporters-and-extreme-right-share-widest-range-junk-news</url> has found. That's because, as the Parsons school's Carroll explains, aside from established outlets like The Wall Street Journal, National Review and Fox News, the right-wing media landscape is a chaotic jumble of YouTube channels, Twitter feeds, Reddit posts and blogs. While celebrating the supposed demise of what former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin used to call \"the lamestream media,\" some on the right seem to have forgotten that journalistic standards and practices--original reporting, fact-checking, the firewall between news and opinion--were largely forged in traditional newsrooms.</p><p>Any supposed \"censorship\" could be little more than an acknowledgement that the digital landscape is not lawless and that standards apply to both individual users and media organizations. Carroll believes that enforcing a measure of decency does not amount to anything grander or darker. \"People are getting booted from platforms, being ostracized into out-groups, because of their abhorrent conduct rather than any systemic anti-conservative bias,\" he argues. Trump adviser Roger Stone, for example, was not expelled from Twitter for his conservative views but, rather, for making threatening and insulting comments about CNN anchor Don Lemon.</p><p>Conservatives, however, still see an ideological war. As CPAC was coming to an end, Cernovich hosted a party in Washington. Apparently relishing the possibility of confrontation, leftist activists protested the event. Cernovich posted video of the protesters--who he says were affiliated with the loosely organized leftist brigades known collectively as antifa, for \"anti-fascist\"--but YouTube removed the post, citing community guidelines regarding \"hate speech.\"</p><p>\"YouTube is censoring honest, unedited reporting about ANTIFA's actions,\" he wrote on Twitter, where no apparent attempts were made to silence him. \"This can mean only one thing--they endorse far-left-wing violence.\" YouTube apologized and restored the video of the protest. But by then it was too late. The video Cernovich made of himself reading the email from YouTube--which he, of course, posted on YouTube--has been viewed more than 100,000 times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW845130_2018-03-23.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S9H-KG91-JC85-S2HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newsweek Inc.

A full apology from the company followed as Apple sought to bring in sweeping changes. However, a year on, it appears as though nothing has changed and user privacy continues to be at risk.&amp;#xA0;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thomas le Bonniec, a whistleblower who had blown the lid off Apple&amp;apos;s secret around listening in to Siri recordings last year, has now written a letter to all European data protection regulators claiming that Apple has ignored fundamental rights and is continuing with its data collection program.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>If an iOS 13 bug is stopping your apps from loading, you&amp;apos;re not alone<br/>Apple&amp;apos;s latest acquisition should help Siri to understand you better<br/>New iPhone 12 release date, leaks, price, news and everything you need to know</p><p>The letter, accessed by The Guardian, which broke the news last year, expressed concern over big tech companies &amp;quot;wiretapping entire populations&amp;quot; despite some robust data protections laws in the world. &amp;quot;Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders,&amp;quot; le Bonniec has said.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>When the initial reports had surfaced last year, Apple had issued a statement in August apologising for &amp;quot;not fully living up to our high ideals&amp;quot; and followed it up with a software update in October. The update allowed users opt-in or out of voice recordings used for improving Siri dictation as well as to delete the stored recordings.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>In fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook had taken to social media to share a video that detailed the company&amp;apos;s security and privacy details in November 2019.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Le Bonniec, who worked as a subcontractor for Apple transcribing user requests in English and French, says now that these recordings weren&amp;apos;t limited to users but also involved families. It recorded everything from names, addresses to searches and conversations in the background, he says ascribing this as a reason for going public.</p><p>The problem isn&amp;apos;t that Apple is continuing to wire-tap as this is not an isolated case. In the past Amazon, Facebook and Google have admitted to similar wrongdoings but the point here is that Apple has made privacy a selling point with the company&amp;apos;s privacy page stating that &amp;quot;At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.&amp;quot;</p><p>Of course, the company did provide users with the ability to delete Siri recordings via the iOS 13.2 update, but these latest accusations by the whistleblower could cause some internal stirrings at the company&amp;apos;s Cupertino headquarters.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>A new security challenge</p><p>In fact, security experts warn that Apple needs to be wary of another report around leaks of their upcoming iOS 14 operating system. A report on Motherboard says that leaked versions of the update are already with security researchers and hackers since February. It claims that someone obtained a development version of the iPhone 11 running iOS 14 and since then the codes have been circulating via Twitter.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Security experts say that the real concern around this specific leak is that unlike others in the past, it has occurred several months before the release of the public beta version of the operating system that is supposed to arrive late in June.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Here&amp;apos;s how you can stay safe</p><p>In case iPhone and iPad users haven&amp;apos;t made the security changes to keep Siri at bay, here is what you should be doing. Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Analytics &amp; Improvement &gt; Improve Siri &amp; Dictation. Check the box and then again move to Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search &gt; Siri History.

The prospect of slower global economic growth, combined with a higher cost of borrowing, and continued uncertainty regarding global trade will demand watchful management of a new set of risks in both developed and developing markets. Macroeconomic trends will likely have an impact on firm performance and companies' balance sheets, raising greater awareness of audit quality concerns and executive compensation practices. Meanwhile, many governance topics that have dominated the landscape for the past few years, such as diversity, climate change, and cybersecurity, will continue to gain momentum and further prominence at boardrooms and company-shareholder engagements. </p><p>Below is our list of ten corporate governance topics to watch in 2019. Diversity: Beyond Gender and Beyond the Boardroom  Board gender diversity continues to be a focus item globally. We expect another record year for new female directors in many markets. A growing number of investors adopt voting policies on the issue, while regulatory mandates emerge in new jurisdictions, including the United States, where California recently adopted board gender diversity legislation that will take effect this year. However, as gender diversity among top executives has remained relatively stagnant, many companies and investors will likely begin to pay closer attention to the composition of the C-Suite and senior management, seeking for evidence of a diverse culture deeper within the organization. Furthermore, diversity assessments will likely expand beyond gender, to consider a more holistic view of backgrounds, including skills, qualifications, age, and ethnicity. Climate Change: New Expectations on GHG Reduction Targets and Risk Management  As the Paris Agreement is set in motion, regulatory and industry-based initiatives are changing expectations about company behavior with respect to carbon emissions, energy efficiency, and the protection of the environment. As studies indicate that existing country commitments are not sufficient to curb temperatures to sustainable levels, we expect private ordering to intensify globally. Investor awareness of climate change risks pushes the issue to the top of the agenda in portfolio assessment and direct engagement with companies. Some investors will likely seek to devise proxy voting policies incorporating climate risk assessments, expressing concerns through votes on director elections, compensation, or other routine items. Market Uncertainty and Audit Quality In 2018, several major accounting scandals broke out across the globe, where a number of well-established firms either collapsed or are struggling to recover after revelations of poor accounting practices and audit failures. Tighter borrowing and slower economic growth may make more companies prone to accounting transgressions. In some emerging markets, excessive borrowing in dollars and weakening local currencies have already exposed companies to significant constraints. Investors will likely be very sensitive to any signal of weakness in internal controls. Overall, companies with robust governance practices are expected to be better positioned to face a market downturn, but the proof will be in the pudding. Executive Misconduct and Key-Person Risk 2018 saw several business icons, such as Carlos Ghosn of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Martin Sorrell of WPP plc, Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, and Les Moonves of CBS, depart their leadership positions at their respective companies in embarrassment following misconduct allegations. Elon Musk maintained his post as CEO of Tesla, but was forced to relinquish the role of Chair of the Board after a settlement with the SEC over charges of stock manipulation in relation to a tweet claiming to take the company private. These and many other examples have given rise to concerns of how boards can provide sufficient oversight over CEO behavior, especially when the executive in person is considered emblematic of the company's brand, and when their behavior can disproportionately impact the firm's value. Investors are becoming more mindful of this key-person risk dependence, which can become more severe when the individual maintains control through economic ownership or via dual class shares. We expect more discussions about how companies can boost their succession plans and oversight mechanisms, including independent board leadership structures, to mitigate for such risks. Executive Compensation: Pay in Volatile Markets - and Fewer Guardrails?  Since the advent of say-on-pay in the U.S., we have not observed a major contraction in economic output, and stock prices have generally soared - and a contraction has only happened once in Europe, where say-on-pay existed in some markets before the financial crisis. 2018 was the first year of negative returns for the S...00 since 2008. However, some U.S. corporate profits reached record highs thanks to the stimulus provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As the effect of the tax overhaul tapers off, and stock markets continue to reflect concerns over a potential economic slowdown, investors will pay close attention to trends in executive compensation. Will the prevalence of relative TSR ensure CEO pay increases despite a market downturn, and have companies installed safeguards to limit requisite payouts in down years? Will the use of stock-based awards result in higher dilution rates, as companies attempt to offset falling stock prices with issuance of more stock? In the U.S., the tax overhaul also triggered deregulation in performance-based pay practices, which may bring rise to potentially problematic pay structures. Furthermore, U.S. companies will provide additional context on CEO-worker pay ratios in response to shareholders and advocacy groups. Globally, transparency and oversight of compensation will be the main topics of concern at markets with less-detailed disclosure, as the case of Carlos Ghosn at Nissan exemplifies. In the U.S., issues may be compounded by the removal of key provisions from the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). These provisions provided encouragement for companies to use performance-based compensation for executives, and to have a degree of transparency regarding performance metrics used in executive compensation programs. In addition, the code also promoted more frequent equity compensation plan submissions to shareholders than listing exchanges require. In the absence of these provisions, companies may opt to take a step back from the advances in good practices that the market has witnessed since 2011. The #MeToo Movement: Equality in the Workplace  While #MeToo has primarily expressed itself over concerns about sexual harassment, the movement touches on a host of issues pertaining to equality in the workplace, including the gender pay gap, workplace discrimination, and gender diversity. Emphasis on accountability at the highest levels of the organization, employee training, and governance mechanisms to prevent inappropriate behavior should play a significant role in addressing sexual misconduct risks. Disclosures on gender pay equity, such as those now mandated in the U.K., will also serve as potential signs of gender imbalances, which may cause internal deliberations at companies as well as external engagement with investors and other stakeholders. As discussed above, a review of gender diversity at multiple levels of the organization may also help address unconscious biases and cultural obstacles. Data Security and Data Privacy  Cybersecurity and data privacy will remain key topics of concern in most industries, and not only in the technology sector, as a vast array of companies rely on technology to manage sensitive information, including consumer data. Typically, governance weaknesses are discovered after the fact, so most investors will likely play close attention to crisis response and board or management oversight. The establishment of security risk management committees, the implementation of comprehensive programs across the organization, and the presence of directors with expertise in cybersecurity and technology may serve as preventive measures. In the U.S., perhaps the largest looming question regards potential legislation enacting regulatory safeguards on personal data. Big Tech in the Spotlight  Technology companies are likely to face increased scrutiny given their size and their pervasiveness in the economy and society. From a pure governance standpoint, concerns over board independence, board leadership, and dual class share structures will continue to receive significant attention. As discussed above, data privacy and the use of consumer data are on the top of the agenda. Furthermore, the social impact of technology platforms will continue to be under review, including election interference and fake news. Social and environmental concerns regarding the supply chains and sourcing materials of technology devices may also be under the microscope. In other words, given their immense scale and their expansive user and consumer base, any activity conducted by big technology firms may be subject to examination. Current Social Issues: Gun Violence and Opioids  In 2018, investor concerns over the public health crises in the U.S. associated with gun violence and the opioid epidemic appeared on proxy ballots in the form of shareholder proposals seeking better disclosure and governance mechanisms at companies that may be involved. Despite being relatively new, both campaigns proved very successful. Most opioid-related proposals were withdrawn by proponents following agreements with companies, while two of the three that went to a vote received majority support. Meanwhile both gun violence-related proposals at American Outdoor Brands Corporation and at Sturm, Ruger .... received support by a majority of votes cast. We expect these campaigns to continue in 2019 with further impetus given the level of responsiveness from companies and investors. Politics, Protectionism, and Cross-Border Transactions The race is on for the U.S. 2020 presidential election, and investors should expect to see a large number of shareholder proposals seeking disclosures on companies' political spending or other political activities. Furthermore, politics in the era of populism can have a significant impact on markets and companies, as candidates will likely raise the anti-globalization rhetoric. In 2018, we saw the first example of government intervention in a merger transaction, with President Trump's executive order to block the Qualcomm-Broadcom deal on the grounds of national security considerations. In Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands are raising protectionist measures against cross-border shareholder activism. Nevertheless, higher borrowing costs and market uncertainty may result in decreased M...ctivity, as deals would become more expensive. That said, international investor activism is will likely continue in Europe and Asia, as we have recently seen at large-cap companies such as Nestle and Hyundai.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p>Columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Columnist</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PNWSJL-pen-1856949356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PNWSJL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-GVN1-JC3H-01NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Pensacola News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pensacola News Journal (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
