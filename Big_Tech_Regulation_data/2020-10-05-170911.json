The world's dominant provider of internet search, advertising and video services has increased spending in recent years on areas including cloud computing and consumer electronics that it views as essential to maintaining its industry leadership in the face of stiff competition from Amazon[1] and Microsoft[2]. Google, however, provides limited product-level financial disclosures compared with some peers, leaving investors increasingly uncertain about how pressures including regulatory scrutiny, advertiser boycotts, and global trade tensions are affecting operations. As a result, analysts say Alphabet shares have underperformed relative to rivals, rising 17% in the last 12 months entering Monday, compared with a 33% gain for Microsoft and 29% for Facebook, the internet's No. 2 seller of advertising. </p><p>Alphabet shares on Monday fell 1.2% in after-hours trade to $1,274.00. Google has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about $2 billion in revenue[3] and saying that plans continued to hire thousands for that unit to stoke growth. Haris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com, said the quarterly results cast a cloud. 'An earnings miss at a time when the big tech companies are being probed for their business practices adds to the uncertainty and creates a hint of pessimism around the company,' he said in an email to Reuters. In hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a[4], its most affordable smartphone yet, went well, according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter. Google also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks. But cash continues to be spent and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators. Total expenses in the third quarter reached $31.3 billion, about 25% higher than a year ago and topping the previous high of $31.1 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter. Google in the third quarter acknowledged investigations by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice[5], and 48 states into the company's competitive practices[6]. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. It also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps. Google has said it is cooperating with the increased scrutiny, while saying that it has survived calls for increased regulation many times. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total third-quarter revenue of $40.5 billion. That was up 20% over last year and compared with 19% growth in the second quarter. Analysts on average estimated 19.52% growth and $40.325 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income for the third quarter rose to $7.1 billion, or $10.12 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.811 billion, or $12.44 per share. The operating margin was 23%, down from 24% in the second quarter. Shares of Google closed 1.95% higher in regular trade on Monday. The shares earlier had risen about 2% after Reuters, citing sources, reported Google had made an offer to acquire U.S. wearable device maker Fitbit[7].

The shares edged 0.7 per cent higher on Monday, bringing Alphabet to within $7bn of the milestone. </p><p>Alphabet\u2019s rise to $1tn comes against the backdrop of growing calls for stronger privacy and antitrust regulation, which have been one of the few clouds hanging over its stock price.</p><p>It also follows a\u00a0 historic change in leadership last month, with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepping back from the company they founded as students at Stanford University in 1998. The shift has stirred hopes on Wall Street that under its new chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet will become more disciplined in its spending, fuelling a further rise in its share price.</p><p>Apple was the first public company to\u00a0 reach $1tn, in August 2018, and is now more than a third of the way to a second trillion. It was followed by Amazon, which has since fallen back below the 13-digit threshold, and then Microsoft, now worth $1.26tn. The tech companies have since been surpassed by\u00a0 Saudi Aramco, which went public last month and now has a market value of $1.87tn.</p><p>Behind its\u00a0relentless rise to a stock market milestone lies Google\u2019s success in positioning itself to become the biggest beneficiary as global advertising and marketing spending has moved online.</p><p>The company\u2019s founders once worried that relying on advertising could jeopardise the independence of their search results, warning in an early research paper about the \u201cmixed incentives\u201d that could result. But advertising continues to account for a significant majority of Alphabet\u2019s sales and the Google division brings in 99.6 per cent of company revenues. Ambitious long-range projects\u00a0such as driverless cars and new drug discovery have yet to see a pay-off.</p><p>The company, which started the last decade with revenue growth of 24 per cent, is expected to report that sales were still growing by nearly 20 per cent as the decade drew to a close \u2014 even though, at more than $160bn, they are now more than five times the level of 2010.</p><p>\u201cTen years ago, I don\u2019t know anyone who thought they\u2019d still be growing at 20 per cent,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The company accounted for only 10 to 15 per cent of global advertising and marketing spending, leaving plenty of room for further expansion, he added.</p><p>\u2018There is no next Google\u2019</p><p>Google\u2019s rise marks a sea-change over the past decade, with mobile advertising rising on the back of booming smartphone use and surpassing the company\u2019s traditional search desktop business in 2018. Mr Mahaney put the continued high growth rate down to the many incremental improvements Google has made to its search advertising service, as well as the acquisition, 13 years ago, of the YouTube video site. \u201cNo one knew how great an asset that would be,\u201d he said.</p><p>As Alphabet starts the new decade under new management, hopes for another phase of growth have moved beyond advertising. A group of businesses that include the Play app store, cloud computing and hardware sales are now growing at more than twice the wider group level and already make up 16 per cent of revenues.</p><p>Some Wall Street analysts have also valued the\u00a0 Waymo\u00a0 driverless car division at as much as $150bn, even though it has yet to develop into a business. But ambitious \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects such as these are also criticised by many investors who argue they have become an expensive distraction.</p><p>\u201cThey keep trying to find the next Google, but there is no next Google,\u201d said Walter Price, who runs Allianz\u2019s global tech fund.</p><p>Referring to the continuing control of Mr Page and Mr Brin, thanks to their ownership of a special class of supervoting stock, he added: \u201cTheir negative influence lingers on even though they are not in management any more. The stock would be 50 per cent higher if they changed their position and became more sensitive to investor needs, as Apple and Microsoft have done.\u201d</p><p>Goal \u2018to make the world a better place\u2019</p><p>The Google founders said at the time of the company\u2019s initial public offering, in 2004, that they did not want to be judged in conventional stock market terms and that their real goal was to \u201cmake the world a better place\u201d.</p><p>In a rare interview a decade later, Mr Page made it clear that nothing had changed. He also expressed frustration that Google had made little impact in the world beyond internet search, despite the scale of its operations and the riches it had amassed.</p><p>Speaking to the Financial Times, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s unsatisfying to have all these people, and we have all these billions we should be investing to make people\u2019s lives better. If we just do the same things we did before and don\u2019t do something new, it seems like a crime to me.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-0237f6c4357111eaa6d39a26f8c3cba4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYW-38H1-JB77-K1J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SAUDI ARABIAN OIL CO (SAUDI ARAMCO)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The second-quarter results showed greater revenue than analysts had anticipated from both Google's advertising and non-advertising businesses.</p><p>Ad clicks on Google's properties rose six per cent compared to the first quarter, when they had fallen nine per cent. The number of ads shown on websites and app with which Google partners held steady compared to last quarter.</p><p>Alphabet's quarterly costs at US$29.764 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. Alphabet last year began spending more on hiring for its cloud computing division, acquiring and policing content, developing artificial intelligence capabilities and adding facilities.</p><p>The second-quarter operating margin was 24 per cent, up from 18 per cent in the first quarter.</p><p>Net income for the second quarter rose to US$9.95 billion, or US$14.21 per share, from US$3.2 billion, or US$4.54 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a US$5-billion charge related to a fine by European antitrust regulators for abusing its dominance in mobile software. Analysts'average estimate for quarterly net income was US$8.024 billion, or US$11.32 per share.</p><p>Shares of the company have lagged its peers this year, rising about 10 per cent, compared to about 20 per cent growth for the S&amp;;P 500 members broadly.</p><p>Intensifying regulatory scrutiny has been a major concern for investors, according to analysts. On Thursday, the Texas attorney general's office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing antitrust actions against big tech companies.</p><p>Reuters reported last month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google over complaints of anticompetitive behaviour.</p><p>Facebook Inc, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday, said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Shares reacted positively to the news, as they have to his stewardship of Google (doubling between 2015, when he was appointed Google CEO, and today).Background: he studied at Wharton business school, Stanford University and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This was followed by a stint at McKinsey ... where he worked as consultant. His first interview at Google was on April 1, 2004, the day Gmail launched. </p><p>He is wiidely credited for making the Google Chrome browser. A year after Pichai took over Android from its creator Andy Rubin, Google shipped 1 billion devices. He went from chief of product and engineering at Google's Internet businesses to Google CEO in 2015 when Alphabet was formed.So Pichai has been running the show for most of the revenue earning businesses and now he's taking over running of the Other Bets side of things as well. He has clearly been groomed for the position, including the hassles that come with it. So while there could be some changes with respect to transparency (for instance more information about YouTube, way forward for Other Bets) and increased investment in the cloud (which has actually already started under new chief Thomas Kurian), day-to-day operations will likely be much the same.That includes employee issues. Google employees have always had more freedom than anyone else for expression and that was in keeping with the startup like atmosphere. Pichai has the difficult role of transitioning the huge company to more of a typical, mature enterprise. In keeping with this goal and perhaps to also reduce the time spent on less fruitful employee interaction, he has reduced the number of employee meetings, discouraged political discussions and fired a few employees that appeared to be engaging in disruptive unionizing.But there is obviously a backlash from such measures and the fired employees are now taking the matter to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Pichai has also dealt with recent employee unrest over treatment of sexual misconduct by executives, a censored search engine for China, a Pentagon contract that may have helped drone strikes and the usual immigrant and LGBT issues.Of greater concern at the moment is the regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, nearly all 50 U.S. state attorneys general, and as one of four tech giants under an antitrust probe by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (mostly Democrats).Page is clearly not off the hook, although he will likely continue to push Pichai forward: 'Congrats on the move, Larry Page!' Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has advocated breaking up big tech companies, tweeted this week. 'Quick reminder: We do still expect you to testify before Congress. And changing your title while staying on the board and retaining effective control of it will not exempt you from accountability.'President Trump's reelection campaign and several Republican campaign committees are also after it for banning political advertising: \"latest arbitrary rule changes are a blatant attempt to suppress voter information, knowledge, and engagement in the 2020 election\" and \"Google is stifling the ability of citizens to participate in our democracy.\"Analysts also had a lot to say.'We view the streamlining of the management structure as a positive for investors,' said Stifel analyst Scott Devitt.'While there's no question that the company will face ongoing regulatory scrutiny, which could lead to some headline risk, the investor community has, to some degree, become numb to this and we believe the positives of the underlying business will outweigh negative newsflow,' Piper Jaffray analyst Michael J. Olson said.Dan Ives, equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said, 'When you look at a lot of the initiatives that Alphabet's doing and where the company is heading strategically, I think the cloud continues to be a focal point for him and the team I think we could see more (mergers and acquisitions) as well as organic initiatives.''He's [Pichai] a long-standing executive with the company. And I think that's important,' D.A. Davidson senior research analyst Tom Forte told Yahoo Finance. 'Look at some of these long-term bets that they've made. They actually beat Amazon AMZN[2] on the first commercial drone delivery, which was Google, and not Amazon, with Walgreens. And I think you're starting to see some traction on the self-driving car front.'MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni called the management change a 'non-event' for Google's immediate prospects, Pichai's appointment may be viewed as shareholder-friendly and extending the trend of more disclosures and stock buybacks. Pichai has 'developed a positive aura and stellar reputation since he became the CEO.'Labor Group Goes for GoogleThe Communications Workers of America union has charged Google for firing four employees (Laurence Berland, Paul Duke, Rebecca Rivers and Sophie Waldman) that they claim were facilitating unionizing at the tech giant. But there seems to be a gap in understanding what goes for allowed and protected grounds for unionizing and what doesn't.As far as Google is concerned, it has fired people engaging in 'intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data security policies, including systematically accessing and disseminating other employees' materials and work'. It categorically says that no one was dismissed for 'raising concerns or debating the company's activities.'The employees say that they only shared what was freely shared within the company. Moreover, since employees are the ones that build its successful products, they wouldn't allow interference in their rights to 'organize for better working conditions, including ethical business practices.' The last few words seem to indicate that it wasn't the 'workplace issues' that Google earlier committed to allow employees, as much as other matters related to the kind of business Google could do, as well as any stand that it might take with respect to immigrants, LGBTs, etc. Obviously, today these issues are both political and workplace and there's no clear line of demarcation between them. So Google feels the employees crossed the line, while they feel they didn't. At any rate, the four fired employees intend to take the matter to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which usually tries to bring about an understanding between the employer and the employees.Europe's Digital TaxA number of countries are taking measures to tax global technology companies in the countries they generate revenue. France has taken the lead, with a 3% revenue tax on companies with at least 750 million euros ($845 million) in global revenue and digital sales of 25 million euros in France, after failing to instigate an EU-wide tax because of opposition from Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.France proposes to tax Internet companies based on their 'digital presence' (number of users) in a country rather than where their headquarters may lie or where they book profits. The changed focus is being justified by dint of the data-driven business models of digital companies, since data is collected in proportion to the digital footprint.France has however said that this revenue tax, applied retrospectively from Jan 1, 2019, will only remain in force until the 36-member Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) arrives at a desirable solution (expected sometime next year). France says that the average tax on digital companies in the EU is only 9.5% compared with 23.2% for other companies. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is looking for a global agreement, failing which she will try to reach common ground with EU member nations.The companies in the low-tax group are mostly American companies like Alphabet, AppleAAPL[3] and FacebookFB[4] but also include British, German, French and Chinese companies. President Trump however sees this as an anti-America move, claiming that American companies should be taxed only in America even when they generate billions abroad. He also threatened increased tax on French goods as a retaliatory measure.Robert Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade representative says that there's scope for $2.4 billion in new tariffs on French cheese, wine and other products. France promises EU-wide retaliation. The President also said this is not the way allies should function (referring to their membership of NATO, which France has earlier called a brain-dead alliance).Meanwhile, other countries like Austria, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, Italy and Britain are looking to go the same way as France rather than wait for an EU-wide solution. The UK's antitrust watchdog is also investigating Alphabet's $2.6 billion Looker acquisition.VerilyThe tech-focused nonprofit, OneFifteen, formed by the combination of Kettering Health Network, Premier Health and Alphabet's Verily (the company's life sciences research arm) to deal with the opioid crisis (and other substance abuse), just started operations at Dayton.While current services are limited to outpatient, inpatient withdrawal management spaces for up to 12 patients will be available next year. The plan is to eventually offer intensive outpatient and residential treatment, co-occurring mental health treatments and medical care services.To make all this happen, Verily is investing an additional $5 million to construct a 5,000 square foot facility to treat an additional 30 patients and offer detox services to nearly 1,300 patients a year.A crisis stabilization unit will open at the Kindred Hospital Dayton in early 2020.Verily management believe that the unit fills a gap in the Greater Dayton area. They say that the number of substance abuse treatment centers per capita in Montgomery County is 44% lower than the national average.WaymoOne of Alphabet's 'other bets' may be paying off. The automated driving startup, which was spun out as Waymo, hit important milestones of 100,000 rides and over 1,500 monthly active riders (those who took at least one ride in the past 28 days). The service has been available to a very small group of a few hundred Android users in the Phoenix Arizona area since Dec 2019.Commercialization is clearly entering the next phase because last month, it started adding fully automated cars (no human driver present) to the fleet. And now, it has added the first iOS app so Apple users can also hail rides.Analyst UpgradeStifel's Scott Devitt upgraded Alphabet stock from hold to buy and raised his price target from $1,325 to $1,525.\"We are encouraged by Google's continued share gains of advertising dollars and see a continued runway for healthy revenue growth, leading us to raise our long-term properties revenue estimates,\" the analyst said. He added that in recent times, 'Google search ecosystem participants have reported [search-engine optimization] headwinds, which may signal incremental monetization of search traffic on Google.\"The price target was raised on the stock's reasonable valuation (relative to its history) and durable earnings growth.He also said that it's too soon to predict what Pichai might do with other bets in his new role, but he assumes that the new CEO \"will keep the long-term portfolio objectives focused with investors in mind.\"Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

It's part of Project Baseline, a data initiative Verily launched in 2017 to support clinical research and collect enough data to one day \"map\" human health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a private project but has been supported by both local and federal officials, developed in collaboration with the California governor's office. President Donald Trump hyped the effort during a March 13 news conference in the Rose Garden, suggesting that Google engineers were working to quickly launch the screening tool.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're honored to help support such an important public health program,\" Verily wrote in a statement announcing the new project. \"By connecting people with testing when it's most needed, we hope to contribute to the efforts to address COVID-19.\"</p><p>So far, the online screener is only available for those living in two counties in California. Verily has said it plans to scale the capability throughout the state, beginning with areas with high volumes of known cases. The company hasn't outlined a schedule for the expansion, but said it plans to move into more regions in the \"coming days and weeks.\"</p><p>It's an ambitious, and admirable, goal, particularly as people living in areas with confirmed COVID-19 cases become concerned about what symptoms to look out for and where to go, said Alain Bernard Labrique, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the global mHealth initiative at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>\"Having vetted and authoritative websites or apps that (people) can use to help either allay their fears or refer them to the appropriate level of clinical support ... I think is absolutely needed at this time,\" Labrique said.</p><p>Reactions to the COVID-19 screener have been mixed, with some applauding involvement of a company known for its powerful artificial intelligence and other technological capabilities, while others questioned how Alphabet intends to use data collected during the screening process.</p><p>There's friction between the value that tech giants can bring to healthcare and the reality that companies want to make a profit, often by mining user data, said Michelle De Mooy, a privacy and data ethics consultant. \"Google may very well have some altruistic reasons for wanting to be a resource for public health, but it's also undeniably interested in gathering data,\" she said.</p><p>That tension has become a growing point of controversy in healthcare, as more health data begins to flow outside the walls of the hospital-and outside the bounds of HIPAA.</p><p>The American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, technology groups and privacy advocates alike have voiced concern over new interoperability regulations issued this month, arguing that they leave gaps in protecting patient privacy. The rules encourage patients to download medical data with apps, which aren't held to the same privacy standards as providers and payers.</p><p>A particular point of concern for Verily's screening project has been that users are required to log in with a Google account. The project isn't covered by HIPAA-Verily isn't working as a business associate of a HIPAA-covered entity, such as a hospital or insurer-raising concerns that data provided during screenings could be linked with other Google services.</p><p>Other tech companies and healthcare organizations, including Providence in Washington state and insurer Oscar Health, also offer online assessments to screen for COVID-19 risk. Those tools tend to direct patients to either stay home or seek medical care. While they might suggest COVID-19 testing, users will largely have to initiate calling and scheduling an appointment on their own.</p><p>Verily's screening tool advertises that the company reaches out to users directly via email to schedule testing and to deliver results, which it said is why it requires a Google account. Verily doesn't allow users to sign up with accounts from other email providers or to self-schedule testing directly with a facility.</p><p>\"An account connects an identity to data,\" De Mooy said. \"Google absolutely does not need to require people to connect to or create a Google account.\"</p><p>The fact that it's a private project touted by the government has compounded privacy concerns. That could affect some users' privacy expectations, said Sara Helene Shanti, a partner in law firm Benesch's healthcare practice.</p><p>\"The government has promoted something that they can't really enforce contractually,\" Shanti said. \"It's natural to assume that the government is supporting this and advocating for it, and is going to protect your data like they would when you submit your taxes,\" she added, as an example.</p><p>Verily has stressed that it-not Google-is collecting information from the COVID-19 screener. A Verily spokesperson said that data collected through the online screener won't be combined with user data stored in Google's products or services, and that screening data will not be used for advertising purposes.</p><p>Verily also plans to delete information collected through the online screener after completing Project Baseline's COVID-19 testing program and after emergency declarations related to the outbreak expire-unless a user \"separately authorizes further retention and use of information,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.</p><p>But those assurances haven't assuaged concerns from privacy advocates, who point out that Verily's privacy policy for the COVID-19 screener allows the company to share information with \"certain service providers engaged to perform services on our behalf,\" including Google, which provides services related to cloud and website hosting for the project.</p><p>And some have noted that the privacy policy for Project Baseline allows Verily to share user data with business partners, as well as use data for commercial product research and development.</p><p>\"Why would anyone trust them?\" Dr. Deborah Peel, president of advocacy group Patient Privacy Rights, said of Google. \"They're not an agency designed to take care of people. Google is an entity designed to extract maximum revenue.\"</p><p>Google has a messy history with data privacy in the consumer world. The company last year paid a fine to settle allegations that its YouTube subsidiary had illegally collected data from children without their parents' consent in order to sell ads, and in 2018 it shut down the Google+ social network after discovering a bug had exposed data on hundreds of thousands of users' profiles.</p><p>Google has had its own set of controversies within healthcare, most recently after details emerged about a massive data-sharing partnership with Ascension.</p><p>But Verily and Google are two separate companies-albeit under the same parent company, Alphabet-with different business models and goals. In fact, when it comes to finances, Google tends to buoy its parent company's more experimental businesses. While Google posted $11.5 billion in operating income last quarter, Alphabet's dozen or so other subsidiaries-which include Verily-reported a collective $2 billion operating loss. Alphabet doesn't break out Verily's earnings individually.</p><p>That said, the two companies are related: not only are users of Verily's project required to have a Google account, but the companies share some of the same leaders, with some of Alphabet's most high-profile health hires-like former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and former ONC chief Dr. Karen DeSalvo-overseeing work in both Google and Verily.</p><p>\"As a member of the Alphabet company family, Verily-for better or for worse-bears scrutiny for its data protection and privacy practices,\" said David Holtzman, an executive adviser for cybersecurity consulting firm CynergisTek and a former senior adviser at HHS' Office for Civil Rights.</p><p>Holtzman said he thinks the online screener will be useful for helping users access information about COVID-19 and testing, and hopes to see it one day expand to regions outside of California. He added that if he were concerned about COVID-19 risk-and eligible to use Verily's screener-he would do so.</p><p>It seems others might agree.</p><p>A Verily spokesperson said the company isn't sharing details on how many patients have received testing, but the website quickly reached capacity just hours after going live on March 15, at which point Verily said it could not schedule any more testing appointments. Verily's website as of last week said it's working to \"rapidly expand testing in every way that we can.\"</p><p>THE TAKEAWAY</p><p>Reactions to a new project from one of Google's sister companies highlight growing tension between patient privacy and business models that have traditionally relied on collecting user data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MHC-5030279</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MHC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ1-52K1-JC0G-4095-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8291</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Modern Healthcare</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23764\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 50</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 23, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Scientific Materials</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The online ad industry has matured in some countries faster than it is growing in developing ones. Google is running into new privacy laws and technologies affecting its ability to charge the typical premium on some ads.</p><p>And the industry has seen a step back from advertisers wary of associating with fake news, borderline hate speech and other topics increasingly seen as divisive by consumers over the last three years.</p><p>Still, strong results for online ad peers including Facebook, Snap Inc and Amazon.com Inc have left investors flummoxed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en260721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3Y-WX51-F0R9-T3FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company's cloud business is much smaller compared with market leader Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, but Wall Street analysts were upbeat about the US$2 billion quarterly revenue from the unit. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, who has big ambitions to eventually generate more revenue from the company's cloud business than its mainstay ad business, said the unit is now at an annual revenue run rate of US$8 billion and would triple sales staff over the next few years. </p><p>\"Much smaller than AWS, but like Azure, growing faster,\" Baird analysts wrote in a note. Amazon, which also reported on Thursday, said AWS raked in US$8.4 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 37per cent jump from a year earlier. Azure sales jumped 64per cent in the fourth quarter. The rise in Alphabet's shares, set for their biggest single-day gain in four years, could help the stock catch up with its peers this year. Through Thursday's close, Alphabet had risen 9 percent this year, compared with more than 30per cent for both Amazon and Microsoft. Alphabet beat second-quarter revenue and earnings expectations on higher ad sales, bouncing back from a rare revenue miss in the first quarter, and offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny. Eighteen Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Wedbush and Evercore making the most aggressive moves by raising their targets by US$150. About 90per cent of all analysts covering the stock have a \"buy\" or higher rating. Still, questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and proposed antitrust rules in the United States and other high-revenue countries will online advertising. \"We expect the negative news flow to continue this year and Big Tech is clearly coming under increased scrutiny,\" Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White wrote in a note. Alphabet on Friday acknowledged a broader U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large technology firms and said it will continue to engage with the regulator.

In addition, the company offered no worrisome guidance even as it faces increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p><br/>It announced a $25 billion stock buyback authorization.<br/>Total quarterly revenue rose 19 percent to $38.9 billion, driven by gains in sales of mobile ads, YouTube ads and cloud computing services, Alphabet said. Analysts on average estimated 16.8 percent growth and $38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.<br/>Revenue of the cloud business jumped to about $2 billion, from $1 billion at the end of 2017.<br/>The jump in shares to $1,240 in after-hours trade put them on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years. Still, shares are down about 4.3 percent since a fall in late April sparked by the first-quarter results.<br/>The latest results brought Alphabet closer to the 20 percent revenue growth it had generated for several years before posting 17 percent growth in the first quarter this year.<br/>\"Investors were anticipating revenue deceleration, but Alphabet delivered a reacceleration,\" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email. \"An increased buyback and greater disclosure around cloud revenue also suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!\"<br/>Alphabet generates about 85 percent of its revenue from tools used in online advertising or the ad space itself.<br/>In the first quarter, company executives said results were affected by exchange rates for foreign currency, competition and an unspecified product change that had boosted results in the year-earlier period. On Thursday, Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel some analyst concerns, saying that enforcement actions against objectionable content on YouTube had \"virtually no impact\" on ad sales.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The second-quarter results showed greater revenue than analysts had anticipated from both Google's advertising and non-advertising businesses.<br/>Ad clicks on Google's properties rose six percent compared to the first quarter, when they had fallen nine percent. The number of ads shown on websites and apps with which Google partners held steady compared to last quarter.<br/>Alphabet's quarterly costs at $29.764 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. Alphabet last year began spending more on hiring for its cloud computing division, acquiring and policing content, developing artificial intelligence capabilities and adding facilities.<br/>The second-quarter operating margin was 24 percent, up from 18 percent in the first quarter.<br/>Net income for the second quarter rose to $9.95 billion, or $14.21 per share, from $3.2 billion, or $4.54 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $5 billion charge related to a fine by European antitrust regulators for abusing its dominance in mobile software.

In addition, the company offered no worrisome guidance even as it faces increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It announced a $25 billion stock buyback authorization. Total quarterly revenue rose 19% to $38.9 billion, driven by gains in sales of mobile ads, YouTube ads and cloud computing services, Alphabet said. Analysts on average estimated 16.8% growth and $38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p><p>Revenue of the cloud business jumped to about $2 billion, from $1 billion at the end of 2017.</p><p>The jump in shares to $1,240 in after-hours trade put them on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years. Still, shares are down about 4.3% since a fall in late April sparked by the first-quarter results.</p><p>The latest results brought Alphabet closer to the 20% revenue growth it had generated for several years before posting 17 percent growth in the first quarter this year.</p><p>Investors were anticipating revenue deceleration, but Alphabet delivered a reacceleration, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email. An increased buyback and greater disclosure around cloud revenue also suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!</p><p>Alphabet generates about 85 percent of its revenue from tools used in online advertising or the ad space itself.</p><p>In the first quarter, company executives said results were affected by exchange rates for foreign currency, competition and an unspecified product change that had boosted results in the year-earlier period. On Thursday, Alphabets chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel some analyst concerns, saying that enforcement actions against objectionable content on YouTube had virtually no impact on ad sales.</p><p>The second-quarter results showed greater revenue than analysts had anticipated from both Googles advertising and non-advertising businesses.</p><p>Ad clicks on Googles properties rose 6% compared to the first quarter, when they had fallen 9%. The number of ads shown on websites and apps with which Google partners held steady compared to last quarter.</p><p>Alphabets quarterly costs at $29.764 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. Alphabet last year began spending more on hiring for its cloud computing division, acquiring and policing content, developing artificial intelligence capabilities and adding facilities.</p><p>The second-quarter operating margin was 24%, up from 18% in the first quarter.</p><p>Net income for the second quarter rose to $9.95 billion, or $14.21 per share, from $3.2 billion, or $4.54 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $5 billion charge related to a fine by European antitrust regulators for abusing its dominance in mobile software. Analysts average estimate for quarterly net income was $8.024 billion, or $11.32 per share.</p><p>Shares of the company have lagged its peers this year, rising about 10%, compared to about 20% growth for the S&amp;P 500 members broadly.</p><p>Intensifying regulatory scrutiny has been a major concern for investors, according to financial analysts.

Second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts' expectations, helping Alphabet dismiss a revenue miss in the first quarter as a blip. In addition, the company offered no worrisome guidance even as it faces increasing regulatory scrutiny. It announced a US$25 billion stock buyback authorisation. </p><p>Total quarterly revenue rose 19 per cent to US$38.9 billion, driven by gains in sales of mobile ads, YouTube ads and cloud computing services, Alphabet said. Analysts on average estimated 16.8 per cent growth and US$38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue of the cloud business jumped to about US$2 billion, from US$1 billion at the end of 2017. The jump in shares to US$1,240 in after-hours trade put them on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years. Still, shares are down about 4.3 per cent since a fall in late April sparked by the first-quarter results. The latest results brought Alphabet closer to the 20 per cent revenue growth it had generated for several years before posting 17 per cent growth in the first quarter this year. \"Investors were anticipating revenue deceleration, but Alphabet delivered a reacceleration,\" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email. \"An increased buyback and greater disclosure around cloud revenue also suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!\" Alphabet generates about 85 per cent of its revenue from tools used in online advertising or the ad space itself. In the first quarter, company executives said results were affected by exchange rates for foreign currency, competition and an unspecified product change that had boosted results in the year-earlier period. On Thursday, Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel some analyst concerns, saying that enforcement actions against objectionable content on YouTube had \"virtually no impact\" on ad sales. The second-quarter results showed greater revenue than analysts had anticipated from both Google's advertising and non-advertising businesses. Ad clicks on Google's properties rose 6 per cent compared to the first quarter, when they had fallen 9per cent. The number of ads shown on websites and apps with which Google partners held steady compared to last quarter. Alphabet's quarterly costs at US$29.764 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. Alphabet last year began spending more on hiring for its cloud computing division, acquiring and policing content, developing artificial intelligence capabilities and adding facilities. The second-quarter operating margin was 24 per cent, up from 18 per cent in the first quarter. Net income for the second quarter rose to US$9.95 billion, or US$14.21 per share, from US$3.2 billion, or US$4.54 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a US$5 billion charge related to a fine by European antitrust regulators for abusing its dominance in mobile software. Analysts' average estimate for quarterly net income was US$8.024 billion, or US$11.32 per share. Shares of the company have lagged its peers this year, rising about 10 per cent, compared to about 20 per cent growth for the S&amp;P 500 members broadly. Intensifying regulatory scrutiny has been a major concern for investors, according to financial analysts. On Thursday, the Texas attorney general's office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing a range of antitrust actions against big tech companies. Reuters reported last month that the US Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google over complaints of anti-competitive behavior. Facebook Inc, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday, said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad US Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies. Alphabet in its earnings release on Thursday did not mention any investigations. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on Thursday \"we understand there will be scrutiny\" and \"we will engage constructively.\" Antitrust complaints lodged against Google by rivals and other critics span its advertising, app store, search and other businesses. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11754916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-05T1-JCDN-13TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><timeReceived>8:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

This is FIRST MOVE and here's your needs to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">B is for buyback. Alphabet shares surge after an earnings beat. Misdelivered: Amazon's earnings showing one day Prime is denting profits; and double vision, Softbank launching a second multimillion dollar investment fund this time though, no Saudis. It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. No Friday feeling on this show. I can tell you, we've got all sorts of information for you -- earnings and data of course, too. So, let's get straight to it because we've had the second quarter GDP numbers from the United States coming in at 2.1 percent annualized. It is a sharp drop from the first quarter's numbers if you remember that 3.1 percent pace, but it is better than expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, what did we see? Business investment falling. Trade, inventory is dragging. The support here, coming from government and consumer spending. Christine Romans is going to break it down for us in a moment.</p><p>But the key point here is yes, it's backward looking data. But it is important to understand what the trend looks like here to understand what the Federal Reserve needs to be doing, if anything, as far as the economy is concerned.</p><p>Right now, futures are higher this morning following a modest pullback in yesterday's trading session; around half a percent for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, one percent for the NASDAQ -- actually the worst performance in a month. Alphabet, Intel, Twitter helping provide some support today.</p><p>We are also halfway through earnings season, of course. So, worth at this stage taking stock. As expected, most firms beating significantly lowered profit expectations, and actually the stronger pace, the strongest pace, in fact, over the past three years. What did I say yesterday? Sack the analysts, yes, I was just being naughty.</p><p>But what we are hearing is that a number of big multinationals are warning about trade. The bottom line here is investors would be far more worried if it weren't for Central Bank easing. And that includes, of course, the Federal Reserve set to cut rates on Wednesday next week.</p><p>But the guidance on future cuts is going to be key, and for that, of course, we need to understand the fundamentals. Let's get to the drivers and those U.S. growth stats. Christine Romans joins me.</p><p>Christine, great to have you back with us on the show. Payback, I think is the name of the game. Payback for the strong trade or net export figures and inventory figures in Q1 leaking away this time around.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and some revisions that we're trying to sort through here. But you're right, payback, indeed, because a lot of companies knew that higher tariffs are probably coming, and that helped juice first quarter -- first quarter numbers when you had 3.1 percent economic growth.</p><p>And so then here, the second quarter numbers are 2.1 percent. So, slicing a point there off of that growth. Still it's stable, it's hanging in there. I mean, when you consider the headwinds from trade overall, when you consider Boeing and its crisis, this is a big part of the American economy. So, there's the Boeing issue there as well.</p><p>The consumer though doing very, very well; behaving quite strongly. And so, I would say, hang in there. This is a deceleration of growth from earlier in the year, no question. But hang in. So, the big debate right now all the money nerds are having, the finance nerds are having is, \"Wait, a 2.1 percent economic growth in the second quarter, does that justify a rate cut right now in an economy that is growing overall with a 50 percent -- a 50-year low for the unemployment rate and earnings that have been coming in great if you look at consumer led kinds of companies? So, that's the debate folks are having this morning on seeing this number.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, and stock market is trading very close to record highs as well, just to throw one other thing. I feel like there's two economies right now in the United States. I mean, the average growth over the last two quarters, 2.6 percent. But if you look at trade, if you look at business investment, the manufacturing sector, it feels recession like, but then if you look at the consumer, you look at jobs, wages -- it's a far better economy. It's a tough one for the Fed here.</p><p>ROMANS: It is. It is also tough when you've got sort of a microphone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that is screaming that you want it. It's the best economy in the history of the world, as the President says, but he wants a rate cut. And so those two ideas don't seem to mesh here.</p><p>Although looking into these numbers, I will say you look at the fourth quarter of last year, it was weaker than thought. It looks like that was downwardly revised pretty substantially, which means that last year might not have been that big, you know, three percent growth year that the White House wanted so badly. And that is what the promise has been from this from the White House. The official statistics were, you know, we expected three percent growth. The President said three, four or five percent growth on the backs of regulatory cuts, on the backs of the tax cuts.</p><p>[09:05:08] ROMANS: That just hasn't really come in there. That Trump economic miracle that he has promised supercharged growth, it hasn't really materialized quite yet. And it looks like even like last year might not have been as strong as we thought.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You have to say it feels like an economic miracle if it belonged to any other country, basically, in the G10, quite frankly, I think they'd be delighted. Christine Romans.</p><p>ROMANS: That's true.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS: It's all relative.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. It is. See, Friday, glass always half full on Fridays. Let's move on to our next driver. Alphabet shares are set to open up at eight percent plus, potentially with their Q2 earnings beating expectations, lifted by Cloud and advertising gains here. But the key point, I think, perhaps the company authorizing a $25 billion buyback.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us. It's a sign of great confidence in the future or the company feels like their stock looks cheap here, or you simply have lots of money, Anna, when you're announcing your $25 billion buybacks, perhaps all of the above.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: I was going to say I'm going to check the box for all of the above. I think it shows that there is a celebration of what is a fairly robust earnings report, also that management does care about the share price, and it is rewarding its investors, and I'm sure we'll see that share price higher on the open today.</p><p>To run you through those highlights that you mentioned; ad revenue, that was the big one. It's the one that investors were really worried about after Q1 because it looked like maybe the advertising revenue was beginning to mature, maybe it was the competition, not just from Facebook, but also of course, Amazon, Alibaba, maybe that was beginning to bite. It beat last quarter, it also beat expectations for this quarter.</p><p>And then as you said, Google Cloud -- this I find interesting -- because Google doesn't often divulge the information. We haven't heard any numbers on this since the end of 2017. But they say, they project their Cloud business will have an annual run rate of $8 billion. Great news. But it does highlight the fact that we don't have much transparency when it comes to Alphabet earnings, in terms of we know what's doing well, because they may decide to divulge certain units. We don't necessarily know which units are underperforming -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you made such a great point here. I mean, we don't even have intrinsic details on YouTube either, which is arguably the advertising powerhouse here, which I find quite fascinating.</p><p>But the other thing, of course is regulatory excitement that we've had this week in particular, and I was looking at the earnings transcript, 52 minutes into a 58-minute call before the CEO even talks about it tells you something.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, I was listening in. It took some time, didn't it? Very interesting, because they are under sort of tech clash, I guess the United States. This week, of course, the Department of Justice, but also the House of Representatives, the Trade Commission, State Attorney Generals -- they are under attack from all sides, but so are all of its rivals.</p><p>It was interesting that the response from the CEO, Sundar Pichai was, \"It's not new to us.\" He will engage constructively. He has committed to addressing any concerns. But frankly, he shrugged it off saying that they've experienced similar both in the States, and you have to remember in Europe as well.</p><p>Since 2017, Google has amassed fines totaling over $9 billion in Europe, an absolutely huge fine if you think about it, but also I think you've got to look in terms of States side, is this politically motivated? Is tech regulation a bit of a political football? If it is this may be vaguely temporary, it might not have teeth to it. And regardless, it will hit it, but all of its rivals as well -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. $121 billion cash on the balance sheet. That gives you some perspective and context on the size of the fine here. They don't care. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let's move on and talk Amazon's earnings as well. Their run of record profits has ended. They made a mere $2.6 billion in the second quarter year-on-year, of course it comes as Amazon makes big investments in one day shipping. Clare Sebastian is on this story for us.</p><p>Clare, it was interesting to see what the CFO said. It does create a shock to the system, the cost of being able to provide one day shipping for Prime members not only about this, but this was a huge issue.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was the biggest issue, Julia, by far. He said that they had predicted it would cost $800 million in the last quarter, and it came in above that. He said things like extra transportation costs, the cost of moving products to fulfillment centers, so they would be nearer to customers. He did say that the customer response has been really good.</p><p>But the one that the street was really watching is the fact that he said that they're in the middle of this journey. This is going to go on for multiple quarters. And I want to bring up the picture of where we see Amazon's profits, the evolution of Amazon's profits over time, because it was in the fourth quarter of 2017 that we really saw a sea change in how much money they were making. They talked a billion dollars for the first time after never doing that before.</p><p>And I think now that we see this deceleration, people are starting to think are we in a new investment cycle? Is this another shift back to the kind of high growth, high investment model that Amazon has really come to define? And I think that's why we see a bit of a dip in the share price today.</p><p>[09:10:06] CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's funny, isn't it? I mean, their Cloud services, the Amazon Web Services. I saw that mentioned several times is slowing. Revenues are only growing at 37 percent now year-on-year, not what we've seen for the last several quarters, which was 40 percent.</p><p>I mean, when you're complaining about 37 percent year-on-year growth, I wonder whether you need a reality check here, Clare.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I was going to say 37 percent is bad -- that really gives you the big picture. But I go back to the numbers that I always look at with AWS, it accounts for this quarter 13 percent of revenues, 80 percent of profit. That is why it's so important to Amazon. This is the key profit driver. This is why they're able to invest so much in the retail business.</p><p>And the key word here, Julia, just as it is in retail, is competition. They have to stay vigilant. They're the market leader, but their market share has been flat-lining a bit while the others like Google, like Microsoft have been growing.</p><p>And we saw just this quarter, Microsoft's Cloud Vision grew 39 percent higher than Amazon's 37 percent, Azure grew at 64 percent. That's the key competitor to AWS today. They say they're spending more on things like sales and marketing, and it looks like they have to, to stay ahead of the competition. Again, we're back to this point. They are back into an investment cycle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Such a great point, Clare, when you've got the largest market share, it's only yours to lose. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that. All right.</p><p>Softbank is the focus of our next driver, launching a Vision Fund Mark 2, this time, they're expecting to raise a slightly bigger fund of $108 billion. The focus will be on artificial intelligence. Sherisse Pham joins us. Sherisse, great to have you with us.</p><p>The key point here I think with the Mark 2 of the Vision Fund is, this time around Softbank itself as the anchor investor, no Saudis invited, it seems.</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: It seems they are not invited to this party, Julia. And I have to say, I went back to the last time we talked about Softbank and you predicted this, you said that the next Vision Fund 2 likely will not come with Saudi cash. I was a little skeptical, you win that bet.</p><p>Because among the dozen or so companies, I think 13 companies and institutions and banks were listed as partners for this $108 billion Vision Fund 2. Companies like Apple which is a repeat investor; Foxconn, another repeat investor, and some other names, Microsoft and you named the investment fund of the Government of Kazakhstan -- they're all in on this new fund.</p><p>But of course, the biggest name that is not on that list is the Saudi government. Of course, Masayoshi Son had to distance himself from the Saudi government after the killing of journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. When he was asked about it back in May during an earnings report when he announced the formation of Vision Fund 2, he was cagey and he said, \"You know, we haven't decided on investors. It's too early.\" Now, we have a few more details and we're seeing the Saudis, they are not listed here -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. He clearly was uncomfortable being asked about that, I think, but you know, if we just look at this in isolation, the benefit of having a huge investor like the Saudis was that it was a sort of counterbalance to a Masayoshi Son himself in his investment decisions.</p><p>I mean, I remember that WeWork investment where there was a rumor that he was going to add an extra $16 billion to the $8 billion he had already invested and the added investment only ended up being $2 billion. I just wonder whether there will be a concern from some of the big players here that he has kind of let loose, if he doesn't have a giant investor in the form of a Saudi this time around.</p><p>PHAM: I think those are interesting points that you raise. However, when that story came out, there didn't seem to be much reporting surrounding saying that the Saudis were the ones that pulled Masa back from making that giant second, additional investment in WeWork.</p><p>As far as we can see, and as far as our reporting has shown, this has always been Masayoshi Son's show. You had a huge anchor investor in Saudi, but you have other big players as well. Apple put up, I think, a billion dollars in Vision Fund 1. They're probably putting up a decent amount of change in this one, too.</p><p>Microsoft, Foxconn -- these aren't companies that are shrinking violets, but Masayoshi Son, he is -- he is the visionary of the Vision Funds and he wants to have a stake in the companies that will lead the AI Revolution.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and you don't have a career like his, I think, without knowing exactly what you want to do and going and doing it. Sherisse Pham, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now to some of the other stories that we're following around the world. North Korea says it launched two short range missiles Thursday as a warning to South Korea. The tests were reportedly ordered personally by leader Kim Jong-un. It comes ahead of Seoul's joint military exercises with the United States set to begin next month.</p><p>[09:15:01] CHATTERLEY: More than 100 migrants have died after a shipwreck off the coast of Libya. Those migrants like thousands before them made the risky journey to escape violence and poverty back home. Survivors are being sent back to Libya where they face more danger amid that country's Civil War.</p><p>Live pictures now from Hong Kong where protesters are taking their fight to the city's International Airport. Scores of demonstrators dressed in black, the color of the protest movement have taken over the Arrival Hall. They're calling attention to safety after a mob attack on a train station and sent 45 people to hospital last Sunday.</p><p>British Police are hunting the two armed men who attempted to rob the Arsenal football stars Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac. The masked men pulled alongside the footballer's vehicle on a moped in North London. The Bosnian footballer Kolasinac is seen leaping out of the car unarmed to confront the would-be robbers before chasing them away. Yes, that'll teach you to take on someone called \"The Tank.\"</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break. But coming up here on FIRST MOVE, a roller coaster week for Facebook and big tech of course with an antitrust probe looming, but what does it mean really? And proof that nice guys finish first, how tech company is changing the world by taking on the almost impossible.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where U.S. stocks look set to open higher after Thursday's slight pullback. The NASDAQ fell some one percent yesterday, the Dow beginning today's session at a two-week low, I'll call that trading around near record highs. New GDP numbers this morning showing the U.S. economy growing at a 2.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter better than expected, but obviously less than that Q1 level of above three percent.</p><p>The strong consumer and government spending offsetting a drop in business investment and net exports. Of course, too, Twitter is the last of the big tech companies to report profits this week. Shares are set to rally after the company reported a greater than expected jump in daily active users.</p><p>[09:20:07] CHATTERLEY: That's their new metric, of course, for measuring user growth. Ad revenue also rose by a better than expected 21 percent.</p><p>And what a week it's been for Big Tech. The U.S. Justice Department launching an antitrust probe. Investors given a pause for thought there. Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are all likely candidates.</p><p>For the inside track, we're joined by Roger McNamee, a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg. He's also the author of \"Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe,\" and now Managing Director and cofounder of Elevation Partners. Roger, always a pleasure to have you on the show.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND COFOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Julia, likewise.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You argued consistently that we need to see much more antitrust intervention here. Are you worried? Or how worried do you think the Big Tech companies are at this stage about what we've heard this week? Because it's not just about the D.O.J., it's the F.T.C., it's the F.T.C., it's a whole host of them.</p><p>MCNAMEE: And there's no sign yet, Julia that the Big Tech companies are worried. You can see Wall Street is not worried. And I think in many ways, that's the metric that they will use to decide when it's time to panic. But I believe there has been a massive change in the state of affairs relative to the government.</p><p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice, the antitrust division, the Federal Trade Commission, the S.E.C. are all investigating not only Facebook, but Amazon, Google, and I hope at some point, Microsoft, because surveillance capitalism, which is this business model these companies use of gathering massive amounts of data and using it to manipulate the behavior of the people who use their products, that has created massive issues, not just in competitions, which is what antitrust is about, but also for public health, for elections, as we know, and also privacy.</p><p>And those are going to require new legislation, which I hope the government will undertake, relatively soon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've called this surveillance capitalism. The fact that for most consumers, we're not even aware that websites, apps, we can say Facebook, which to your point it's far broader than that are continually collecting our data where we've been, and right now we can say, \"Look, you're not allowed to use that data,\" if you're smart enough to know how to stop that. But we can't stop them collecting it. Do you think that that's easier to achieve than perhaps antitrust? Tacking them all on antitrust?</p><p>MCNAMEE: You know, Julia, this is the important question that we need to answer right now. The challenge that we face and a Harvard Professor by the name of Shoshana Zuboff is the person who coined the term \"surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>She wrote a brilliant book earlier this year that really describes how this economy works, and it's not just the internet platforms. It's really every business we touch is collecting data. And the problem is whether it's banks, or credit card processors, healthcare companies, cellular companies, online applications, affinity cards -- they're all collecting data, and they will sell it to pretty much anybody who wants to buy it.</p><p>And now companies like Amazon have Alexa, Google has Google Assistant and Google Home. Facebook has got Portal, you know, you have projects in New York City at Hudson Yards and in Toronto, where Google Sidewalk Labs is putting surveillance absolutely everywhere.</p><p>And you know, these things are incredibly in my mind dangerous to society, because we lose any sense of privacy, any sense of control over our lives, and to do that without a discussion I think is inappropriate. I think the important thing is, let's get the facts out there, which is what I'm trying to do. Let's have a fulsome discussion, and see what people think.</p><p>Because there's a lot more going on here than consumers realize. And I think once they discover what's going on, they're going to want to have -- I think, at least some level of regulation, not just on antitrust for competition, but also of the way data is collected and treated.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, if we could crack down on this, this would then have an impact on the business model, because in the end, selling the data, access to that data is what advertisers care about. So, if we did see restrictions on this, you know, then at least it would have a material impact whereas a $5 billion fine for Facebook this week is peanuts.</p><p>MCNAMEE: And Julia, that is precisely the point. The way I look at this, and I think the way all of our viewers should be looking at this is that internet platforms are today what chemical companies were in the United States say around 1950. Chemical companies were growing incredibly rapidly. They were unbelievably profitable, because they poured their waste products, products like mercury and chromium into freshwater polluting rivers and streams.</p><p>They would leave the tailings for mines on the side of hills. They would pour spent fuel into sewers, and they never had to bear any cost for that until the 80s. And eventually society caught up with them and made them bear the cost of that. it turned out the chemical industry wasn't nearly as profitable.</p><p>[09:25:07] MCNAMEE: And I think in the case of Facebook, the damage that they've caused to public health, democracy, privacy, and competition would probably make Facebook unprofitable if they had to bear all the costs that they create, and in Google's case, it would reduce the profits dramatically.</p><p>And I just think it's a matter of time until society recognizes that you have to make the people who create cost, pay them. It's not fair to make society pay all those costs.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, in the end, if you want to take antitrust action, you have to prove that the consumer has been hurt. And at this stage, I'm not sure whether the consumer would want to see action. You know, we love ridesharing. Amazon has revolutionized our lives and made shopping easier. Wherever I look here, I see utility benefits. Facebook, it's free, it's a utility value, it's a communication tool. That's a problem for me.</p><p>MCNAMEE: So, Julia, and here's the thing, I think the questions you're asking are right on. I think there are two points we really need to explore here. The first is relative to products like Facebook and Google and some of Microsoft products, they aren't actually free. It's a barter of a service for data. And what's going on is that the value of that data is rising much more rapidly than the value of the service.</p><p>So in fact, consumers are being harmed in the form of a higher price to them. So in antitrust terms, there really is an issue here. But the second thing we want to remember is that the deal you're doing here is not the one you think is going on, right? Most of us think, we give up a little personal data in exchange for a service we love. And that was certainly true until five years ago, but it's not true anymore.</p><p>Now, they're collecting data everywhere and they are manipulating us. They're manipulating the choices that are available to us. There is no reason we're going to have to give up the things we'd like. It's really obvious that all these services are valuable and --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Roger, I have to stop you there because we've got the market open, we will get you to talk about this more.</p><p>MCNAMEE: I understand. My pleasure. Thank so much, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much. Every time I speak to you I think we should be buying tech. It's not happening anytime soon. Regulation not happening anytime soon. Roger McNamee, the Managing Director and cofounder of Elevation Partners. Sir, thank you for joining us. The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange. That was the opening bell for the final time this week and a positive open for U.S. stocks this morning, taking back some of the losses that we saw, of course, in yesterday's trading session better than expected growth numbers from the United States for the second quarter this morning, significantly lower than the first quarter of course, but better than expected and that was the last piece of economic data -- key economic data -- before the Fed meeting next week.</p><p>We've also got more earnings of course, Apple on tap and trade talks, Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer heading to Beijing, so plenty to watch next week, too.</p><p>What about for our global movers right now? I can tell you, we've got a number of them in focus. Twitter, second quarter earnings beating expectations, they reached 139 million monetizable daily active users. That was a 14 percent increase year-over-year. It's the first report of course not to disclose the monthly active users, so it changed there in how they report revenues. Meanwhile, up some 18 percent year-on-year.</p><p>Starbucks, the coffee chain's quarterly earnings beating estimates. They raised their full-year earnings and revenue guidance as well. Sales at U.S. stores open for at least a year grew some seven percent boosted by three percent to traffic growth. It comes after months of struggling to improve that traffic. Sales at stores in China open at least a year jumped six percent. That's good news for the company, too. That despite the broader economic growth concerns over there and competition from arrival Luckin Coffee.</p><p>What about Intel, too? Apple buying the chipmaker's smartphone modem business for some $1 billion. It had been rumored, the deal is expected to close later this year.</p><p>Ahiza Garcia joins us now on this story. This is an interesting one for me. Smart from Apple because it gives them diversification. Obviously, they were switching between Qualcomm and Intel here when they want to buy their chips. Now, Intel in-house.</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, CNN BUSINESS TECH WRITER: Yes, the deal is really a good move for Apple because it gives them access to about 2,000 new employees from Intel who will now join Apple. It gives them access to intellectual property, as well as leases and equipment.</p><p>And it's a crucial time right now because Apple has reported iPhone sales are slumping as people are not as quick to replace phones. They're lasting longer. And so this gives them more control over the entire smartphone ecosystem. And they're able to bring that in-house and kind of maybe counteract some of the kind of hurt that they're feeling from those slump in sales.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What does this mean for Qualcomm of course? Because we know and we've talked long talks about the battle that Apple was in with Qualcomm over chips, where does this leave Qualcomm now?</p><p>GARCIA: You know, I think it'll still shake out, we'll still have to -- it remains to be seen kind of how that will impact their bottom line in the end. But obviously, it's not good news for them. Their stock was down when the initial reports of the potential deal between Apple and Intel were first reported.</p><p>So again, it remains to be seen, they may be able to pivot, partner with some other big smartphone maker. And there are other ways to kind of get involved in the 5G ecosystem beyond just smartphones. So, maybe there's room for that, as well. But, you know, we'll continue to see those impacts, I'm sure as the deal is finalized, if that happens, and then, you know, kind of moving forward as 5G rolls out across the world, essentially.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. It's interesting for me for Android and for what Google does here, because suddenly they don't have the option of Intel chips now either. So, it could be quite interesting for Qualcomm here because literally Android phones now are purely reliant on them. I wonder whether they might be quietly cheering at this stage, too. Ahiza, great to have you with us. Ahiza Garcia there.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break, but still ahead, going negative: Wall Street debates the effects of this stimulus and the effectiveness of stimulus as the Fed begins its policy debate; and more government yields to negative. What does this all mean for investors? We will be asking. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:37:40] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. U.S. stocks still higher in early trading. Tech stocks are the outperformers, thanks to strong results from the likes of Alphabet, Intel and Twitter as we've mentioned. In the meantime, shares are higher in Europe, too, and it was a pretty mixed day in Asia. Tons of debate in both regions about the effectiveness of further stimulus with bond yields deeply in negative territory, in fact, 25 percent now, I believe globally of sovereign bonds in negative territories and negative yields.</p><p>In Europe, German bunds have traded at record lows this week of minus 0.42 percent. Switzerland and Denmark have seen their entire yield curves go negative. France is now selling 10-year bonds with negative yields and yields on Greek government debt have been trading below two percent for the first time ever. What does this all mean?</p><p>Joining me now Steven Englander is the Global Head of G10 FX Research at North American Microstrategy at Standard Chartered. Fantastic to have you with us.</p><p>STEVEN ENGLANDER, GLOBAL HEAD OF G10 FX RESEARCH AT NORTH AMERICAN MICROSTRATEGY, STANDARD CHARTERED: It's always a pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Happy Friday. Let's talk about the GDP numbers, the second quarter GDP numbers because there are components in that which do send signals to the Federal Reserve, particularly inflation signals.</p><p>ENGLANDER: indeed, and I want to actually pay attention to the GDP output number, what was important is that they did five years of revisions to GDP data. And the big outcome is that inflation is lower than we thought. The market based core PCE for Q2 was 1.5, the regular core PCE is 1.8, the market was expecting 2.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And this is something that the Federal Reserve very much pays attention to here.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, it gives a lot of ammunition to the doves who are saying, \"Look, we've got to worry that not only are we missing our targets, we're sort of ...\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're moving away from it.</p><p>ENGLANDER: We're missing our targets and getting closer to the zero bound. So you know, I think that 50 would be under discussion. Had they not kind of had that kerfuffle last week, and then sort of come out and saying we're doing 25, don't worry about it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, interesting.</p><p>ENGLANDER: It doesn't mean that would have been done, but it certainly would have been discussed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you think it has basically been rolled out because they simply don't want to further confuse.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, how much do they want a surprise and how -- you know, how important is it doing, say 25 and say 25 versus doing 50? I don't think it's important that I don't think that they think it's important.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you were saying how important is it at this stage to cut by half a percentage point versus doing it one now and another quarter point cut later on then this year. Is there a benefit? Because you know, we've had the discussion on this show, Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley said there is a benefit. The data shows that if you cut fast and furious, starting out early, you can actually save yourself cuts going forward.</p><p>[09:40:25] CHATTERLEY: And when we're talking about so many bonds around the world with negative yields, and simply not seeing inflation coming up. You kind of have to save ammunition, don't you? So if you can do more early and save yourself later on, you should do it.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, I'd say most of the models that they have, and kind of the evidence that we have is that what matters is how low and how long kind of the cumulative ease that you have there? Surprising by 50 now, but then holding back in two months, it makes a very small difference in terms of what actually happens. Temporarily, there could be a signaling effect, but what really matters is how far you take it and how long you keep it there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What I said on the show earlier was that it feels like there are two U.S. economies. There's the consumer side, the jobs market that looks incredibly strong. And then if you look at trades, you look at manufacturing, you look at business investment in particular, it's kind of recessionary with a material slow down feel to it. Would you agree with that?</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, it's certainly the case. I mean, we've been seeing, manufacturing PMI as kind of slowing and you know, services PMI is looking okay. Employment is great. Claims are super low yesterday. I think the - - you know, the core of the economy is a service based economy that keeps on hiring and where you're just not seeing a lot of wage and price pressures.</p><p>And that's like, you know, 80 percent, 85 percent of the economy, the manufacturing component is --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tiny.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Relatively small. And, weirdly enough, employment and manufacturing has been doing very well, despite -- you know, but certainly by historical standards, despite the concerns about manufacturing production and where it's headed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, if we're talking about borderline concerns, not only about low inflation, but perhaps softening inflation at this stage, what should investors be looking at? You made the point before we came on air that it's an argument for buying gold here?</p><p>ENGLANDER: Yes. Look, you know, there's so many fixed income assets with negative yields, and low yields. You know, gold we think is under owned. We just published a piece, my commodities colleague who -- there was a survey that suggests that Central Banks are kind of ramping up or thinking they're going to be ramping up their gold buying. Retail seems to be lagging.</p><p>Gold looks attractive. We think emerging markets, all the guys who had funding issues last year, because U.S. rates are going up, literally, this is Christmas in July for them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Where does this all end up? Where do we end up when we're talking? And just so our viewers understand, when you're talking about negative bonds here, you're talking about, as an investor, or a buyer of those bonds, effectively paying the government, they then borrowing money from you. I mean, it's bonkers.</p><p>ENGLANDER: It is. I think what it reflects is the political failure of being able to bring fiscal to bear when it's currently needed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why?</p><p>ENGLANDER: And I think ultimately, what's going to happen is that the ECB and the other Central Banks with negative rates, they'll do one more round of cuts and turn to their Finance Ministers and say, \"Look, you know, the cupboard is empty.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Time to spend.</p><p>ENGLANDER: There's nothing left, you know. We did a round that we actually didn't think was going to work and it didn't work. You have to do fiscal and I think if you look at Draghi at Central when it was speaking for himself, and Draghi yesterday, when he was speaking for the ECB, he was most enthusiastic about fiscal and he's -- he didn't seem that convinced himself that the other measures were going to work.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I've been to many of these meetings over the last few years and he has always reiterated the need for governments to do more and yes, in short supply. Steven Englander of Standard Chartered, thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I must say, buy gold. All right, let me bring you up to speed with today's \"Boardroom Brief.' Chinese state media reports that Beijing officials suspect FedEx of holding back more than 100 packages that tech firm Huawei was trying to deliver to China.</p><p>The Chinese government opened a probe nearly two months ago after Huawei said FedEx had diverted China bound packages to the U.S. No response from FedEx as yet.</p><p>Shares in French luxury fashion house Kering were sharply down. It follows the slowdown in sales at its Gucci brand. Gucci accounts for more than half of Kering's revenues. Total revenue still rose from 15 percent in the first half, and shares are up 14 percent year-to-date.</p><p>And there was a sweet treats for Nestle which is marking sales boost for the first half of 2019. Strong demand in the U.S. and Brazil pulling growth of around a 3.6 percent in sales making 2019 the food giant's highest top yearly sales in four years.</p><p>[09:45:09] CHATTERLEY: All right, when we return, an extremely lucrative business whose sole purpose is helping others. Sound impossible? I promise you it's not. My conversation with the CEO of Not Impossible Labs, next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and straight into the \"Chatt Room.\" There's a California based tech company that's making the impossible possible. It's called Not Impossible Labs. It's an innovation lab and storytelling studio focused on developing technology for social good. Their business model is simple, find a problem and fix it.</p><p>So, they set up a 3D printing lab in war-torn Sudan to help those who've lost limbs and created wearables that allow the deaf to experience music through vibrations. I sat down with the founder and CEO, Mick Ebeling and asked him how he got started.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICK EBELING, CEO AND FOUNDER, NOT IMPOSSIBLE LABS: I'm the luckiest person in the world because I get to look at these real world absurdities that exist. When you see something and you go, \"Okay, that shouldn't be that way. That doesn't make sense.\"</p><p>And then we dog pile on it with our team and makers and programmers and technologists and hackers, and we solve that problem for one person. And that's really -- that's part of our design process. We solve it for one person, then we tell the story of that solution for one person.</p><p>And in doing so, our corporate partners, the Intel's or the Zappos, or ABnet or these companies who are really passionate about this, they take it and they help us amplify the story, which that's this beautiful cycle. They have this incredible outpouring of support for their companies and their brands and it helps scale the solution so more people can be helped.</p><p>So, I think it's such an important distinction. Right now, companies are realizing that doing good is not relegated to the big charities, the responsibility and Larry Fink wrote about it in his Davos letter this year, it's about corporations saying, \"Wait a second, we can go do good and we can do more good than sitting back and letting charities do it.\" And it's good for our business. Business improves.</p><p>People want to work for your companies, it's easier to retain them. Companies grow faster when they do good; so, that's this cycle of our business. We're not a nonprofit, we're a business and we're really proving that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, this is not charity. Even though you're solving a problem for one person, it's scalable to some degree, but it's the social good. It's the benefit of the business. It's hiring talent. It's -- we're in an era I think more and more where young people want to go work for a business that's doing good, and so there's a business reason for businesses to be involved in this kind of thing.</p><p>EBELING: And isn't that beautiful when businesses say, \"Wait, I mean, we're sitting on the New York Stock Exchange,\" when businesses say doing good is actually going to help my share price, my stock value, and then the world gets helped and more people want to work for that company, then you've got this cycle where now the world is actually advancing because of business.</p><p>[09:50:10] EBELING: And I think that's a beautiful, beautiful thing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ebeling says much of Not Impossible's success comes from working closely with its partners to find fresh world absurdities to solve. And the innovations they create, often end up helping in more ways than one. Ebeling told me that's one of the things he truly loves about his work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EBELING: I love what I do. I love what I do. I love partnering with our partners, because they wield this really big sword that we can then use to go and slay dragons to that are actually advancing the world. And so it's just -- yes, we're pretty lucky at Not Impossible. We get to make the impossible not impossible. I mean, how much luckier can I be?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're a music producer? And you spotted a problem, an artist with ALS, and you were like actually, how can I help him continue to create his art? How is an entrepreneur do you go from doing one job to spotting a problem, as you say, and going actually, \"I can turn this into a business actually, it's not a charity.\" As you said, \"I can make this work.\"</p><p>EBELING: The first time -- the very very first thing that we did was we created the eyewriter, which we spotted. We were introduced to a paralyzed street artist who had ALS, and was lying motionless in a bed for seven years, unable to talk to and unable to communicate, and didn't have access.</p><p>This was the discovery that I hung on and he did not have access to the Stephen Hawking machines that I thought were ubiquitous. And we said, well, that's not right. Let's hack a solution together and make it so he has that access to communication.</p><p>And that was a total fluke, it was a total accident. But that ended up becoming \"Time\" magazine's top 50 inventions of the year. And it made us say, \"Okay, wait a second, this whole using technology to help people, there's this energy. There's meat on the bone there, maybe we should keep doing that.\" And that was kind of the birth of Not Impossible Labs.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you profitable as a company?</p><p>EBELING: Very profitable. Because we're able to create things that we incubate. We incubate in the most frugal and smart way and then our corporate partners come on board and help us amplify that message to then do good. So, not only do we make money in our partnerships, but then the devices that we create have lives on to themselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I have to say, I speak to a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of new companies and it's very rare that when I ask one like that, if they're profitable, they go, absolutely. But maybe that's a measure of the man here and the individual that's built this.</p><p>Anyway, in assistive technologies, it could be a $26 billion industry by 2024. That's according to the research firm, Coherent Market Insights. A lucrative opportunity, perhaps then to lure potential investors. Ebeling also noted, however, that people are simply living longer today, too, and as a result is company is coming up with new inventions and innovations to extend the quality of that extended life. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EBELING: We just created what we consider to be one of the world's lowest cost lightest modular mobility devices. Why is that important? We're living longer. People don't want to be driving around in these ugly little carts and really want to be driving a Tesla. So, we made this -- we made this sexy mobility device that is now light and modular. So now -- and it's also what's key to everything we make is it has to be accessible. So, it's the cheapest thing on the market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you looking for investors?</p><p>EBELING: Absolutely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Direct money to scale up?</p><p>EBELING: Absolutely. And not only in launching these absurdity projects that we do where we incubate the technology, but after we've created these things, people coming in and saying, \"Okay, that was amazing. That's an amazing -- it has amazing potential. We want to invest and scale this bigger.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay.</p><p>EBELING: Our principle is help one, help many. We help one by incubating this technology to help a person but the many is where we truly see kind of leaving our impact on the world when more people can have access to low cost inexpensive solutions that have true business principles underlying them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you can operate internationally or around the world.</p><p>EBELING: Absolutely. Good, doesn't have a border to it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No, it doesn't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That was Mick Ebeling there, the founder and CEO of Not Impossible Labs. All right, we're just about wrapping up the show here. But let me give you a look at what we're seeing right now for US markets. We are in positive territory.</p><p>The NASDAQ of course, as you can see, outperforming there, a whole deluge of earnings, managing it to lift us higher, of course, Alphabet one of the key ones there that are adding to the markets at this stage. And now more than taking back yesterday's losses in the session, too.</p><p>Plenty coming up. Apple of course is going to be the one to focus on next week and trade talks as well.</p><p>[09:55:02] CHATTERLEY: What about some of the movers that we're watching as well? Twitter, adding to some of the gains that we're seeing here. Some seven -- Q2 earnings beating expectations with 139 million monetizable daily active users. They're up nine percent as you can see. They're up more than $41.00</p><p>Starbucks also having a great session as well lifting us here too, up some six and a half percent. Quarterly earnings beatings estimates, but it was all about the forecast. They're raising their full-year earnings and revenue forecast and strength in China. Remember, we spoke to you at Luckin Coffee. The CFO over there. Increased competition from a rival, a Chinese-based rival there over in China, but Starbucks still managing to bring it, too.</p><p>And Intel, of course Apple buying the chipmaker's smartphone modem business for a billion dollars. I made the point. Of course, it could be interesting for Qualcomm now that Android Google phones are purely reliant on Qualcomm going forward. That's an interesting one.</p><p>I'll be back in in a couple of hours' time on \"The Express\" to track the movements of these markets. But for now, that's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You can also listen to our podcast at cnn.com/podcast. But for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours and have a happy Friday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

users may have been exposed to external developers by a bug that was present for more than two years in its systems.</p><p>The company said in a blog on Monday( https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/ ) it had discovered and patched the leak in March of this year and had no evidence of misuse of user data or that any developer was aware or had exploited the vulnerability.</p><p>Shares of its parent company Alphabet Inc, however, were down 1.5 per cent at US$1150.75 in response to what was the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit the United States' big tech companies.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194?mod=searchresults&amp;;page=1&amp;;pos=1\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194?mod=searchresults&amp;;page=1&amp;;pos=1</url> ) that Google had opted not to disclose the issue with its Application Program Interfaces (API) partly due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unnamed sources and internal documents.</p><p>Google said it had reviewed the issue, looking at the type of data involved, whether it could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take.</p><p>\"None of these thresholds were met in this instance,\" it said. \"We found no evidence that any developer was aware of this bug, or abusing the API, and we found no evidence that any Profile data was misused.\"</p><p>Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), if personal data is breached, a company needs to inform a supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedom of users.</p><p>\"It seems like the downside risk of having a story that says they intentionally hid information about a major breach from users is bigger than the upside of avoiding scrutiny,\" said Geoffrey Parker, an engineering professor at Ivy League college Dartmouth.</p><p>\"I wonder if there wasn't more depth to the internal debate.\"</p><p>Regulatory Interest</p><p>Google said a software glitch in the social site gave outside developers potential access to private Google+ profile data between a major redesign in 2015 and March 2018, when internal investigators discovered and fixed the issue.</p><p>The affected data was limited to static, optional Google+ Profile fields including name, email address, occupation, gender and age.</p><p>The WSJ report said that a memo, prepared by Google's legal and policy staff and shared with senior executives, warned that disclosing the incident would likely trigger \"immediate regulatory interest\" and invite comparisons to Facebook's leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple investigations in the United States and Europe.</p><p>Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai was briefed on the plan not to notify users after an internal committee had reached that decision, according to the WSJ.</p><p>Google came under criticism for refusing to send a top executive to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 5 about efforts to counteract foreign influence in U.S. elections and political discourse.</p><p>\"I think Google does have a public relationship issue and this now makes their lack of openness even worse,\" Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners said.</p><p>Facebook's chief operating officer and Twitter's chief executive testified at the hearing, where an empty chair was pointedly left for Google after the committee rejected Google's top lawyer as a witness.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018 !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Delhi, Oct. 09 -- Google will shut down the consumer version of its social network Google+ after announcing data from up to 500,000 users may have been exposed to external developers by a bug that was present for more than two years in its systems.</p><p><br/> The company said in a blog on Monday it had discovered and patched the leak in March of this year and had no evidence of misuse of user data or that any developer was aware or had exploited the vulnerability.<br/> Shares of its parent company Alphabet Inc, however, were down 1.5 percent at $1150.75 in response to what was the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit the United States' big tech companies.<br/> The Wall Street Journal reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussio\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussio</url> ns-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1 earlier that Google had opted not to disclose the issue with its Application Program Interfaces (API) partly due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unnamed sources and internal documents.<br/>Google said it had reviewed the issue, looking at the type of data involved, whether it could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take.<br/> \"None of these thresholds were met in this instance,\" it said. \"We found no evidence that any developer was aware of this bug, or abusing the API, and we found no evidence that any Profile data was misused.\"<br/> Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), if personal data is breached, a company needs to inform a supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedom of users.<br/> \"It seems like the downside risk of having a story that says they intentionally hid information about a major breach from users is bigger than the upside of avoiding scrutiny,\" said Geoffrey Parker, an engineering professor at Ivy League college Dartmouth.<br/> \"I wonder if there wasn't more depth to the internal debate.\"<br/> REGULATORY INTEREST Google said a software glitch in the social site gave outside developers potential access to private Google+ profile data between a major redesign in 2015 and March 2018, when internal investigators discovered and fixed the issue.<br/> The affected data was limited to static, optional Google+ Profile fields including name, email address, occupation, gender and age.<br/> The WSJ report said that a memo, prepared by Google's legal and policy staff and shared with senior executives, warned that disclosing the incident would likely trigger \"immediate regulatory interest\" and invite comparisons to Facebook's leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica.<br/> Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple investigations in the United States and Europe.<br/>Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai was briefed on the plan not to notify users after an internal committee had reached that decision, according to the WSJ.<br/>Google came under criticism for refusing to send a top executive to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 5 about efforts to counteract foreign influence in US elections and political discourse.<br/>  \"I think Google does have a public relationship issue and this now makes their lack of openness even worse,\" Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners said.<br/>Facebook's chief operating officer and Twitter's chief executive testified at the hearing, where an empty chair was pointedly left for Google after the committee rejected Google's top lawyer as a witness.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

His resume reads like the typical Silicon Valley operator: a Master's degree from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and a stint as a consultant at McKinsey &amp;; Co.</p><p>He joined Google in 2004 and started amassing responsibility for some of Google's most popular products, including Gmail, the Chrome browser and Android. Former employees often describe him as a collaborative and loyal colleague.</p><p>He even turned down a big new grant of stock in 2018 because he felt he was already paid generously, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>When Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created the Alphabet holding company in 2015, Pichai was chosen to run Google, whose businesses including YouTube, Maps and Gmail bring in almost all of the company's revenue. That left the founders to chase visions of building self-driving cars and technology to make people live longer. Brin and Page stepped away from their posts as president and CEO of Alphabet on Tuesday, handing total executive control to Pichai, although they'll stay on the board.</p><p>In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, Pichai enjoys a positive reputation as the guy keeping the cash flowing at Google. But, partly because Brin and Page were still technically in the picture, Pichai is less wellknown outside of tech circles.</p><p>When the U.S. Senate held a hearing last year to ask what the big tech companies were doing to stop election meddling on their platforms, it invited Page first, not Pichai. Neither went, and Google was represented by an empty chair, although Pichai made the trek later to a House Judiciary Committee meeting.</p><p>Now, there won't be any confusion about who the CEO is.</p><p>\"Going forward, the story is much simpler: Sundar is the only sheriff in town,\" analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in a note on Tuesday.</p><p>Pichai has done more than just keep the lights on at Google. He's put artificial intelligence at the centre of the company's pitch to customers and investors, arguing that Google's prowess in AI technology will give it an edge in all its different businesses, from cloud computing and search ads to healthcare software and mobile phones. He replaced Diane Greene with former Oracle Corp. executive Thomas Kurian as head of Google's cloud business. Under Pichai, Kurian has started ramping up acquisitions to expand the unit's footprint, buying Alooma, Looker, Elastifile and CloudSimple this year alone.</p><p>Pichai's actions as head of Google could give a clue as to how he will run the broader conglomerate. In the last couple of years, Google has poached employees or whole units from the Alphabet constellation, bringing them inside to bolster its own projects. Chronicle, a cybersecurity unit, was supposed to be independent, but in June Google's cloud division swallowed it whole. The same thing happened to health-related projects started by DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research arm.</p><p>Pichai has also leaned into his assumed role as Google's defender-in-chief, making trips to Washington to explain the company's decisions to lawmakers.</p><p>Internally, he has pushed back against employee activists who are clamouring for change on a variety of issues from military contracts to the company's handling of sexual-harassment allegations.</p><p>He reduced the number of the once-hallowed town hall meetings Google workers use to vent their frustrations with management to once a month, down from every week.</p><p>And last month, Google fired four employees who had been pushing for the company to stop selling software to U.S. immigration authorities. Google says the employees violated their colleagues'privacy by tracking the calendars of certain executives and sharing details outside of the company.</p><p>The four employees say they plan to file complaints with the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>Managing worker dissent and regulatory scrutiny while playing catch-up in cloud and keeping up growth at the core ads business is a tall order, but the market seems to have confidence in Pichai. Google's stock ended the day up 1.9 per cent after the announcement.</p><p>At a conference last year, an audience member asked Pichai about the employee revolts against Google's artificial intelligence work with the U.S. government. In a rare moment of directness, Pichai pushed back against the idea that instead of running the company, the company was running him.</p><p>At the end of the day, he's the CEO, Pichai said. \"We don't run the company by referendum.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

His resume reads like the typical Silicon Valley operator: a Master's degree from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and a stint as a consultant at McKinsey &amp;#38; Co.</p><p>He joined Google in 2004 and started amassing responsibility for some of Google's most popular products, including Gmail, the Chrome browser and Android. Former employees often describe him as a collaborative and loyal colleague. He even turned down a big new grant of stock in 2018 because he felt he was already paid generously, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>When Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created the Alphabet holding company in 2015, Pichai was chosen to run Google, whose businesses including YouTube, Maps and Gmail bring in almost all of the company's revenue. That left the founders to chase visions of building self-driving cars and technology to make people live longer. Brin and Page stepped away from their posts as president and CEO of Alphabet on Tuesday, handing total executive control to Pichai although they'll stay on the board.</p><p>In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, Pichai enjoys a positive reputation as the guy keeping the cash flowing at Google. But, partly because Brin and Page were still technically in the picture, Pichai is less well-known outside of tech circles. When the U.S. Senate held a hearing last year to ask what the big tech companies were doing to stop election meddling on their platforms, it invited Page first, not Pichai. Neither went and Google was represented by an empty chair, although Pichai made the trek later to a House Judiciary Committee meeting.</p><p>Now, there won't be any confusion about who the CEO is.</p><p>\"Going forward, the story is much simpler: Sundar is the only sheriff in town,\" analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in a note on Tuesday.</p><p>Pichai has done more than just keep the lights on at Google. He's put artificial intelligence at the center of the company's pitch to customers and investors, arguing that Google's prowess in AI technology will give it an edge in all its different businesses, from cloud computing and search ads to health care software and mobile phones. He replaced Diane Greene with former Oracle Corp. executive Thomas Kurian as head of Google's cloud business. Under Pichai, Kurian has started ramping up acquisitions to expand the unit's footprint, buying Alooma, Looker, Elastifile and CloudSimple this year alone.</p><p>Pichai's actions as head of Google could give a clue as to how he will run the broader conglomerate. In the last couple of years, Google has poached employees or whole units from the Alphabet constellation, bringing them inside to bolster its own projects. Chronicle, a cybersecurity unit, was supposed to be independent, but in June Google's cloud division swallowed it whole. The same thing happened to health-related projects started by DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research arm.</p><p>Pichai has also leaned into his assumed role as Google's defender-in-chief, making trips to Washington to explain the company's decisions to lawmakers. Internally, he has pushed back against employee activists who are clamoring for change on a variety of issues from military contracts to the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations. He reduced the number of the once-hallowed town hall meetings Google workers use to vent their frustrations with management to once a month, down from every week.</p><p>ALSO READ: Tough times for Pichai as regulators, staff seek answers</p><p>And last month Google fired four employees who had been pushing for the company to stop selling software to U.S. immigration authorities. Google says the employees violated their colleagues' privacy by tracking the calendars of certain executives and sharing details outside of the company.</p><p>The four employees say they plan to file complaints with the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>Managing worker dissent and regulatory scrutiny while playing catch-up in cloud and keeping up growth at the core ads business is a tall order, but the market seems to have confidence in Pichai. Google's stock ended the day up 1.9% after the announcement.</p><p>At a conference last year, an audience member asked Pichai about the employee revolts against Google's artificial intelligence work with the U.S. government. In a rare moment of directness, Pichai pushed back against the idea that instead of running the company, the company was running him.</p><p>At the end of the day, he's the CEO, Pichai said. \"We don't run the company by referendum.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Its revenue grew 53 per cent in the latest quarter, to $2.6bn. However, this fails to match Microsoft's 62 per cent growth just announced and the business is only about the size of Amazon Web Services' five years ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube\u2019s annual advertising revenue topped $15bn last year after rising 36 per cent, and accounted for almost 14 per cent of total advertising from Google\u2019s own properties. Impressive, but this business is around 30 per cent smaller than analysts had been guessing.</p><p>What Alphabet did not disclose was profit numbers for the two businesses, but it's clear that the cloud\u00a0can be another pillar of growth and YouTube has both advertising and subscription strengths. We learnt YouTube Music has around 20m subscribers, YouTube TV has about 2m and overall subscription revenues were around $3bn.</p><p>In contrast, hardware is an area of weakness currently. Alphabet shares are down\u00a03 per cent today after it missed revenue expectations, with the company partly blaming\u00a0lower hardware numbers compared to the year before, when its Pixel smartphone had seen a jump in sales.\u00a0</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Big Tech targeted by Germany</emphasis><br/>Germany\u2019s government has proposed a clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by digital platforms, putting Berlin in the vanguard of European efforts to regulate Big Tech. The draft \u201cdigital law\u201d will strengthen the intervention powers of Germany\u2019s competition watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office. Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, said the measures would \u201ctoughen control of abusive practices for big market-dominating digital companies\u201d. We also have the story of the controversy over Singapore's\u00a0four-month-old\u00a0 law against \u201conline falsehoods\u201d, while email app maker Blix\u00a0is suing Apple for allegedly copying its app and has called on other small companies to rise up against what it claims are strong-arm tactics by the iPhone maker</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Tesla on a tear</emphasis><br/>Tesla jumped as high as 17 per cent on Tuesday, extending a vertiginous stock spike that has made it the world\u2019s second-largest automaker by market value. The stock, which has more than doubled since December, surged to $912 in morning trade. It was given a boost after the company last week reported a $105m profit for the fourth quarter, prompting short-sellers to rapidly claw back bearish bets on the electric car maker.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Micro Focus loses more over\u00a0Loosemore</emphasis><br/>While Elon Musk's personality\u00a0can sometimes power Tesla's stock price, the UK's Micro Focus saw its shares plunge in the opposite direction on Tuesday as it lost its own charismatic\u00a0leader. Executive chairman Kevin Loosemore has left after 15 years\u00a0 as it continues to struggle with its reverse takeover of Hewlett-Packard\u2019s software assets. The stock\u00a0fell another 16 per cent on Tuesday and it is\u00a070 per cent off its 2017 peak, notes Lombard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Relx adds Emailage to its Inbox</emphasis><br/>Relx is to buy Arizona-based Emailage for about $480m, as the UK-listed information and analytics group deepens its push into the fraud prevention sector. Emailage uses machine learning, its own data and a global network of partner companies to help predict fraud associated with email addresses and online identities. The acquisition is the latest in a string of takeovers by the former Reed Elsevier in this area, including a $375m deal last month to buy San Diego-based ID Analytics and the 2018 purchase of ThreatMetrix for roughly \u00a3580m.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daily newsletter</emphasis></p><p>Track trends in tech, media and telecoms from around the world</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/56703b20cb56e617eb2c4084/subscribe\"> Sign up here with one click</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. The promise of synthetic data</emphasis><br/>Creating synthetic data is seen as a way of filtering anonymised data so it can't be linked back to people through crossmatching different data sets. Anjana Ahuja writes data scientists are becoming excited by its potential to squeeze useful information from tightly held databases. Uncovering fraud, for example, can be challenging because regulations restrict how information can be shared, even within banks. Synthetic data can help to unveil useful patterns, while masking individual incidents.</p><p>Tech tools \u2014 Shadow</p><p>The voting app Shadow is in the spotlight, with it being blamed for the counting chaos in the Iowa caucuses. Tim Bradshaw reports its developers say they are \u201ccampaign and technology veterans\u201d who have worked for Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Apple and Google. \u201cOur mission is to build political power for the progressive movement by developing affordable and easy-to-use tools for teams and budgets of any size,\u201d its website says. Iowa won't go down as a great ad for that aim.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-62f61856477811eaaeb3955839e06441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4K-S9R1-DXP9-93W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><timeReceived>6:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the newly anointed chief executive of Alphabet Inc.  GOOG, 1.04%[1] GOOGL, 1.00%[2] , the Google CEO is now in charge of all operations at the $850 billion behemoth that includes a laundry lists of challenges from a federal antitrust investigation to employee backlash over harmful business practices and a slowing core ad business. </p><p>See also: Google founders step down, put Pichai in charge of Alphabet[3]  The decision by company co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to step aside and hand the reins to Pichai, who took over Google in 2015, leaves Pichai in an unenviable position, say corporate governance and legal experts. 'It feels as if Page and Brin have given up and never liked the spotlight,' Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor, told MarketWatch. 'Pichai is not being used as a foil to blame, but as a shield to protect them from hard problems.' Chief among them is a Justice Department-led probe of Alphabet's vast business operations that reportedly includes scrutiny of its YouTube property. Pichai, who has calmly and adroitly testified before Congress on data and privacy issues while Page and Brin were noticeably absent, is likely to be the focus of tough questioning in the future, though Page isn't entirely in the clear now that he is no longer Alphabet CEO and involved in day-to-day operations. 'Congrats on the move, Larry Page!' Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has advocated breaking up big tech companies, tweeted this week. 'Quick reminder: We do still expect you to testify before Congress. And changing your title while staying on the board and retaining effective control of it will not exempt you from accountability.' Indeed, the change in executive management at Alphabet will not change how the government proceeds in investigating the company \u2014 nor will the new roles of Page and Brin reduce their responsibility, according to legal experts. 'At the end of the day, at least for antitrust-type matters, the identity of the senior managers is just coloration that has little, if any, substantive importance,' Doug Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School, told MarketWatch in an email message. As Alphabet's clear-cut leader, however, Pichai is on the hot seat as well, Sonnenfeld said. Employees have been outspoken in their criticism of the company for its handling of accusations of sexual misconduct by executives, and for its plans for a censored search engine in China as well as a Pentagon contract that could aid drone strikes. Four engineers recently fired by Google said they plan to file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. They accuse the company of engaging in a sweeping illegal campaign to silence employee activism. Google claims the workers committed data-security violations.. Pichai's added responsibilities also includes what to do with so-called 'Other Bets,' wildly ambitious startups under the Alphabet umbrella that, with the possible exception of autonomous-driving project Waymo, have been less than scintillating.  The billionaire founders, who retain voting control of the company even though they collectively own less than 12% of it, have been down this road before. From 2001 to 2011, Eric Schmidt led Google to record revenue as CEO before Page succeeded him.  Alphabet's new corporate structure took hold in 2015, with the ascent of Pichai as Google CEO. Under him, Google was responsible for 99.6% of Alphabet's $136.8 billion in revenue last year, according to FactSet.  Despite it all, and the perception that Google's billionaire founders are leaving Pichai and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat to do some major heavy lifting while they act as puppeteers in the background, several analysts expressed relief that there is clear and distinct order atop the company's org chart. 'We view the streamlining of the management structure as a positive for investors,' Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said in a Dec. 5 note that raised Alphabet's target price to $1,525, from $1,325, and upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold.  'Sundar is the only sheriff in town,' Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey wrote in a Dec. 3 note. 'If anything, our conversations have suggested modest confusion among investors as to the need for GOOGL's matrixed leadership structure.'  There are even some analysts who downplay the regulatory risk for Alphabet, regardless of who is in charge. 'While there's no question that the company will face ongoing regulatory scrutiny, which could lead to some headline risk, the investor community has, to some degree, become numb to this and we believe the positives of the underlying business will outweigh negative newsflow,' Piper Jaffray analyst Michael J. Olson said in a Dec. 3 note initiating coverage of Alphabet. He gives the stock an Overweight rating and price target of $1,500.

Driven by ad sales, second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts' expectations. In addition, the world's largest online search and ads firm, unlike No. 2 online ad player Facebook Inc a day earlier, offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny. The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a US$1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter, which had prompted an outburst of investor questions and the biggest one-day sell-off in its shares in about seven years. In after-hours trade on Thursday, the shares rose to US$1,226.60, on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years though still down about 4per cent from their high before the April slide. </p><p>Alphabet's shares have lagged peers on Wall Street this year, rising about 9 percent through Thursday's close, compared to a roughly 20per cent gain for the S&amp;P 500 broadly. Questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and antitrust rules proposed or already passed in the United States and other high-revenue countries will slash ad prices. Google also faces an industrywide slowdown in ad sales in the United States and Europe, with revenue from emerging markets not yet picking up the slack. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on Thursday that advances in ad targeting and new services for consumers worldwide would spur growth. He said the company had survived calls for regulation before. \"We understand there will be scrutiny,\" and \"we will engage constructively,\" he said. WEAKENING CONCERNS Alphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total second-quarter revenue of US$38.9 billion. That was up 19per cent over last year and compared with 17per cent growth in the first quarter. Analysts on average estimated 16.8per cent growth and US$38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The last time that Alphabet had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth below 20per cent was three years ago. Executives said the latest results backed their contention that the performance recently has been affected by currency exchange rates and one-off fluctuations rather than advertiser flight or some deeper challenge to its business. Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel other analyst concerns, saying the company has seen \"virtually no impact\" to revenue from efforts to stop running ads on YouTube videos that some have characterized as extremist or hateful. Alphabet authorized up to US$25 billion in new stock buybacks, aiming to make use of its US$121 billion in cash. Pichai said quarterly revenue from licensing cloud computing services and workplace software jumped to about US$2 billion, from its last disclosure of US$1 billion at the end of 2017. He said the cloud unit would triple its sales staff over the next few years. Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email that the buyback and cloud updates \"suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!\" Net income for the second quarter rose to US$9.95 billion, or US$14.21 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of US$8.02 billion, or US$11.32 per share. Alphabet's quarterly costs at US$29.76 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. The operating margin was 24per cent, up from 18per cent in the first quarter. Alphabet in its earnings release on Thursday did not mention any government investigations. Facebook Inc, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday, said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies. Reuters reported last month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google over complaints of anti-competitive behaviour. Accusations lodged against Google by rivals and other critics span its advertising, app store, search and other businesses. On Thursday, the Texas attorney general's office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing a range of antitrust actions against big tech companies.

Driven by ad sales, second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts' expectations. In addition, the world's largest online search and ads firm, unlike No. 2 online ad player Facebook a day earlier, offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny. </p><p>The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a $1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter[1], which had prompted an outburst of investor questions and the biggest one-day sell-off in its shares in about seven years. In after-hours trade on Thursday, the shares rose to $1,226.60, on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years though still down about 4% from their high before the April slide. Alphabet's shares have lagged peers on Wall Street this year, rising about 9% through Thursday's close, compared to a roughly 20% gain for the S...00 broadly. Questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and antitrust rules proposed or already passed in the United States and other high-revenue countries will slash ad prices. Google also faces an industrywide slowdown in ad sales in the United States and Europe, with revenue from emerging markets not yet picking up the slack. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on Thursday that advances in ad targeting and new services for consumers worldwide would spur growth. He said the company had survived calls for regulation before. 'We understand there will be scrutiny,' and 'we will engage constructively,' he said.Weakening concernsAlphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion. That was up 19% over last year and compared with 17% growth in the first quarter. Analysts on average estimated 16.8% growth and $38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The last time that Alphabet had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth below 20% was three years ago. Executives said the latest results backed their contention that the performance recently has been affected by currency exchange rates and one-off fluctuations rather than advertiser flight or some deeper challenge to its business. Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel other analyst concerns, saying the company has seen 'virtually no impact' to revenue from efforts to stop running ads on YouTube videos that some have characterized as extremist or hateful. Alphabet authorized up to $25 billion in new stock buybacks, aiming to make use of its $121 billion in cash. Pichai said quarterly revenue from licensing cloud computing services and workplace software jumped to about $2 billion, from its last disclosure of $1 billion at the end of 2017. He said the cloud unit would triple its sales staff over the next few years. Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email that the buyback and cloud updates 'suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!' Net income for the second quarter rose to $9.95 billion, or $14.21 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.02 billion, or $11.32 per share. Alphabet's quarterly costs at $29.76 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. The operating margin was 24%, up from 18% in the first quarter. Alphabet in its earnings release on Thursday did not mention any government investigations. Facebook, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday[2], said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies. Reuters reported last month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google[3] over complaints of anti-competitive behavior. Accusations lodged against Google by rivals and other critics span its advertising, app store, search and other businesses. On Thursday, the Texas attorney general's office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing a range of antitrust actions against big tech companies.

AP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The decision by Google parent Alphabet's co-founders to step down from day-to-day running of the firm and appoint Sundar Pichai as chief executive will boost investor confidence, calm regulatory frictions and add new synergies to the group's loss-making \"other bets\" venture, analysts say.</p><p>Mr Pichai was appointed as the new chief executive of Google's parent company Alphabet on Tuesday, replacing co-founder Larry Page. The firm's other co-founder, Sergey Brin, also stepped down from his role as the company's president.</p><p>\"Fresh senior executives are probably better suited to negotiations and to navigate the diplomatic tightrope than technology innovators,\" Neil Campling, co-head of Mirabaud Securities' Global Thematic Group, told The National.</p><p>This move has been \"thoroughly planned and thought out\", he added, saying that with the founders stepping away \"it should be much easier for Mr Pichai to make appropriate changes internally\".</p><p>The co-founders will remain directors of Alphabet. However, they will no longer oversee the company's day-to-day operations.</p><p>The appointment of Mr Pichai has come as no surprise. He has worked at the firm 15 years and has been chief executive of Google since 2015.</p><p>Sundar Pichai is now the chief executive of Google parent Alphabet. AFP</p><p>More cynical observers might perceive the timing as a means of escape for both founders at a difficult time for Alphabet both internally and externally, said Matthew Kendall, chief telecoms analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.</p><p>\"But these frictions have been brewing for quite some time, and the founders' absence at the helm means that Mr Pichai will be well aware of the challenges the company faces,\" he told The National.</p><p>\"What has changed now, however, is that Mr Pichai will no longer adopt a caretaker role when it comes to Alphabet's future strategic direction.\"</p><p>Established in August 2015, Alphabet was born out of a corporate restructuring of Google. The 21-year-old company then became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet and all of its shares were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Alphabet.</p><p>Alphabet separates Google from \"other bets\" that are not part of its core business. These include more than a dozen companies such as biotech firm Calico, self-driving car technology business Waymo, healthcare software company Verily, drone company Wing and investment subsidiaries GV and Capital G.</p><p>However, over the years, \"other bets\" has continued to weigh on company's bottom line. In the third quarter ended September 30, \"other bets\" incurred an operating loss of more than $941 million (Dh3.45bn billion), whereas the core Google business remained highly profitable, generating operating income of more than $10.8bn.</p><p>Analysts say Mr Pichai's takeover could lead to a turnaround in the fortunes of the non-core businesses and also revive investors' confidence.</p><p>\"With being promoted to the top post of Alphabet, Mr Pichai would probably work on a cohesive plan for all the businesses under Alphabet to streamline policies and put out fires that the company has been in the centre of,\" Abbas Ali, managing editor of TechRadar Middle East, told The National.</p><p>\"Without doubt \u2026 Google/Alphabet needs to take a couple of steps back to move forward.\"</p><p>Google saw its slowest revenue growth in three years this year due to increased competition in advertising and stumbles in its smartphone business. The company posted $40.5bn in revenue and a net income of $7.1bn for the third quarter to September 30.</p><p>\"Investors think now there is a greater chance of the other bets paying off and reaching solid financial metrics than under the direction of the founder,\" said Mr Campling.</p><p>Alphabet</p><p>\"He [Mr Pichai] has a closer attention to detail and financials and he has been responsible for deciding to shut down some previous ventures [such as the unpopular Google Glass in 2015].\"</p><p>Nevertheless, industry experts say it won't be an easy task to successfully take over the reins of Alphabet for Mr Pichai, who is credited for creating the Chrome browser and successfully taking over the Android business from its founder, Andy Rubin. A year after Mr Pichai took on Android, Google shipped 1 billion devices globally.</p><p>\"His [Mr Pichai's] decision-making and managerial capabilities will be put to the test at a time of ever-intensifying scrutiny on big tech and Alphabet's overall development,\" noted Mr Kendall.</p><p>Despite stepping down, both founders still control more than 51 per cent of the company's shares.</p><p>As of April, Mr Page held 26.1 per cent of Alphabet's total voting power, Mr Brin 25.25 per cent and Mr Pichai less than 1 per cent.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/50/157555474084.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/50/157555474084.jpg</url></p><p>Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page will remain directors of Alphabet and no longer oversee the company's day-to-day operations.

It's too early to tell when another big breakout will occur, but judging by the stock's past history, it'll come at some point, says Keith Richards, portfolio manager and technical analyst for ValueTrend Wealth. Google parent company Alphabet is making the news on Wednesday as the European Union hands down more antitrust fines to the company over its advertising practices. </p><p>The 1.49 billion Euro fine is the third such penalty from the EU, together totaling almost $10 billion Euros. 'We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns. Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe,' said Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, in a statement. And while some investors fear further regulatory impediments for the big tech companies like Google and Facebook, the FAANG stocks as a group have fared well so far in 2019 after a disastrous Q4 of 2018. Alphabet is currently up almost 16 per cent year-to-date. Looking at a longer timeline, Richards says the prospects of bigger gains for the stock are looking good. 'In 2017, a lot of the FAANG stocks just kind of went bananas and they really did get quite overbought,' Richards told BNN Bloomberg Tuesday. '[For Alphabet], 2017 was perfectly smooth, there were hardly any bumps [on the chart], and all of a sudden, 2018 comes along and we're getting some bumps.' 'If you look at a longer history for Google, you'll see that it actually does this. It goes through these consolidation periods and then it goes up. It's one of the more predictable stock patterns. It goes sideways and then up, sideways and then up. So the next move will be up. It's going to break out but we don't know when,' he says. For about two and a half years between early 2010 and mid 2012, Google's share price stayed relatively flat before effectively doubling between mid-2012 and early 2014. Then came another flat stretch before the stock once again took off in mid-2015. That kind of repeated pattern makes GOOGL a long-term hold candidate, Richards says. 'It's actually a great long-term stock. This is the one company that I don't mind being a buy-and-hold investor with. It could stay sideways for another year or it might break out tomorrow, but either way, it's a great long-term chart,' he says.FacebookTwitterLinkedin Digg StumbleUpon Reddit emailRelated Posts [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantechletter.com/stock-quotes/?qm_symbol=GOOGL\">https://www.cantechletter.com/stock-quotes/?qm_symbol=GOOGL</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CANT1211571553110839724251762100049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANT-121157</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-4J11-JCMN-Y3YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><timeReceived>7:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cantech Letter</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company reported advertising revenue of $32.6 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase, while its so-called Other Revenues category, which includes cloud computing and its hardware efforts, hit $6.18 billion, or a nearly 40% increase year-over-year.</p><p>On the company s earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the cloud unit has reached an annual run rate of over $8 billion, which is the first financial update the company has shared since February 2018 when he called it a  <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>billion-dollar-per-quarter business</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. </p><p>Although Google is widely seen as a distant third in cloud market share behind Microsoft and leader Amazon, that new disclosure pleased analysts on the call and beat projections from Morgan Stanley,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>which had pegged the unit s revenue at $6 billion per year for 2019</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.

The online-search giant's shares fell more than 4% early Monday. Watch Google[3] trade live.Google may soon be the subject of antitrust probe by the Department of Justice, according to a report from Wall Street Journal reporters Brent Kendall and John McKinnon[4]. Business Insider later confirmed the reports, citing a source on Capital Hill[5]. Google parent Alphabet fell more than 4.5% early Monday. The investigation would examine the competitive practices of Google's search business as well as other segments of the firm, such as YouTube and Waymo. </p><p>The report comes after the Federal Trade Commission declined to take action in 2013, after a multi-year investigation. Both the DOJ and the FTC have jurisdiction over the search giant's competitive practices. The investigation comes after calls for stronger regulation of Google and other tech giants[6], such as Facebook and Amazon, from Democratic presidential candidates. Facebook has faced intense criticism[7] for its role in running Russia-based advertisements during the 2016 presidential election, while Amazon has drawn new scrutiny from the FTC, according to a subsequent report from The Washington Post[8]. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has been the most strident critic so far, calling for the outright break-up of the companies[9]. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power,\" said Warren campaign representative Saloni Sharma.  \"Elizabeth's plan would help ensure tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" Sharma added. Alphabet[10] shares are little changed this year. <url

They're also communities that cater to people with fringe views who have been kicked off mainstream sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the more recent startups is Hatreon, a crowdfunding site for people creating controversial content. (Watch the whole series Divided We Code)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Even if we find ideas objectionable, they have to be there for us,\" said Cody Wilson, the 29-year-old founder of Hatreon. \"We have to support them, and not because they're easy, only because they're controversial.\"</p><p>Who's being funded on Hatreon? Right now, it's a who's-who of the alt-right -- people like prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin, founder of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. Hatreon \"patrons\" support these men, and many other provocative figures, on a monthly basis. Anglin collects the most money, getting $7,800 a month from more than 200 patrons.</p><p>The people on Hatreon have been widely condemned as racists, misogynists, anti-Semites and white supremacists who may inspire violence with their rhetoric. But Wilson tries to reframe their vitriol.</p><p>\"These people are, at worst, trolls, performance artists, provocateurs, vulgarians,\" he said. \"At best, they represent elements of a political speech that should not be censored.\"</p><p>While he doesn't align himself with all their worldviews, Wilson is enabling the \"political speech\" of these characters. He's taking a cut too: He gets 5% of every dollar raised on Hatreon.</p><p>The site is a direct response to the escalating debate over content policies on the internet. Tech companies are increasingly forced to find a balance between removing propaganda and harassment while still embracing free speech. A growing number of people like Wilson are accusing the companies of politically motivated enforcement.</p><p>Hatreon sprung up this summer after two high-profile users were kicked off Patreon, a more mainstream crowdfunding site for artists and creators.</p><p>\"Why do we approve of Facebook's decision on what is and isn't acceptable speech?\" asked Wilson. \"Why would we approve anyone deciding what is and isn't acceptable for us to read? And who would we give that job to even if we had to?\"</p><p>Hatreon isn't the first controversial project from the Arkansas native, now living in Austin. Several years ago, Wilson posted directions online for how to 3D print a gun, leading Wired to call him one of the most dangerous people on the internet. (The State Department forced him to take the blueprints down, but he's fighting to put them back up.)</p><p>\"I think I'm known, at least in the underbelly of the internet, as one of the more radical free-speech activists,\" he said.</p><p>AN OPPORTUNITY</p><p>PewTube is another \"alt-tech\" platform launched earlier this year. It was started as an alternative to YouTube after the Google-owned site started being more aggressive about removing content.</p><p>\"I think we're reaching a point where these sites are becoming monolithic,\" said PewTube founder Anthony Mayfield. \"When there is a need for [new] technology because of a clampdown, a lot of really smart minds say, 'OK. Here is a problem,' and they think about how to address it. It's going to spur a huge backlash and digital innovation.\"</p><p>PewTube is still small -- it just passed 400,000 total video streams. And the content is mostly amateur postings, much of it extremely disturbing -- including videos that glorify mass murderer Dylann Roof, those that equate black protesters with primates from \"Planet of the Apes,\" and one that puts Holocaust atrocities to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's \"Sound of Silence.\"</p><p>But Mayfield is less concerned about what's being said, and more concerned that these content creators not be censored.</p><p>\"It's a scary moment right now for the internet and free speech,\" he said. \"We run a really dangerous risk saying people who we find distasteful aren't able to use these services.\"</p><p>Mayfield said he was inspired to start the site when a professor and free speech advocate he admired, Jordan Peterson, was temporarily locked out of his YouTube and Gmail accounts earlier this year. While Peterson told the Toronto Sun he expected \"political reasons,\" the details as to why he was locked out aren't clear. He did not respond to CNN Tech's request for clarity. Google said it would not comment on individual user's accounts but said, \"YouTube never took down or suspended his account, and his videos have remained accessible.\"</p><p>Gab, an alternative to Twitter, launched just before the 2016 election and is probably the most notable of the \"alt-tech\" sites right now, claiming more than 200,000 users.</p><p>Gab says \"all are welcome\" -- a nod to the First Amendment. But, really, it gained popularity by attracting \"contrarians\" who got sick of Twitter's terms of service. In August, the company tweeted that it crowdfunded more than $1 million to keep the site going.</p><p>FIGHTING THE BEHEMOTHS</p><p>This is all happening as tech companies not only find themselves part of the broader culture wars, but as they come under greater scrutiny for their sheer size and power. And it's not only people with extreme political views who are sounding the alarm.</p><p>\"What we're seeing with these platforms is a monopolization of control over commerce on the Internet,\" said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a left-leaning nonprofit that had its own run-in with Google.</p><p>\"When you have this much power in these few hands...not only might they take this information and manipulate the flow for their own political good, they're also just sloppy about it.\"</p><p>The debate inevitably comes down to what the government's role should be in regulating these behemoths. Lynn, for his part, believes anti-monopoly laws have to be part of the solution.</p><p>Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt, unsurprisingly, advocated that tech companies have an important role in \"ranking\" content on the internet. \"Would you rather have us make this decision, or the government make this decision?\" he asked in an interview earlier this month.</p><p>Hatreon's Wilson doesn't want either group to have that power. That's why he created his peer-to-peer funding platform.</p><p>\"Google is an advertising company. It has no role in policing American discourse. It sells f***ing ads on the internet, right? Facebook is a social media company that just steals your data from you because you voluntarily gave it up. They have no role of authority in American living.\"</p><p>Currently, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter monitor hate speech on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation and have content policies that prohibit violent threats. But the perception of uneven or arbitrary enforcement has plagued the platforms.</p><p>In some ways, the big tech companies have acknowledged the shortcomings of their policies, or at least their inconsistent enforcement. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have addressed the issue in the last year under public pressure.</p><p>But even consistently defining hate speech has proved difficult for these platforms.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean anything, it distracts you. It uses a moral justification to silence and to censor,\" Wilson said. \"Any book is, in the right hands, like a grenade. This can't be controlled and we shouldn't try to control it.\"</p><p>THERE'S STILL A LINE</p><p>Of course, even these more radical sites have their own content restrictions.</p><p>PewTube says it doesn't allow copyrighted material or pornography. \"We don't want to have to deal with obscenity and stuff like that,\" said Mayfield.</p><p>Wilson said he legally can't let people crowdfund who have been convicted of money laundering, fraud or those who are on the State Department's terror list. While Hatreon's community guidelines say the \"site stands for free speech absolutism,\" Wilson reserves the right to kick people off if there are violent threats or illegal activity.</p><p>\"A lot of these questions are already handled legally,\" said Wilson. \"If I'm abusing you, if I'm harassing you, then there are laws [to prevent] abuse, harassment, intimidation. ... These are not free speech acts.\"</p><p>But revenge porn, the distribution of sexually explicit material without the subject's consent, is a gray area. Hatreon's terms of service are broad: \"If you do harmful things we may cancel your account.\" Wilson admits that revenge porn is a \"wrong and a direct harm,\" but since it's not illegal in all jurisdictions, it's not explicitly addressed and won't necessarily get you kicked off Hatreon.</p><p>As for his motivations, Wilson has a few.</p><p>\"I'm making this stand because I have to carry on the tradition of the English civil liberties and free speech if no one else will,\" he said.</p><p>\"The closest my politics comes to any traditional school is anarchism,\" he said. \"I don't like the imposition of state controls over human creativity, freedom, individuality. The way to oppose these things is to undermine the powers of traditional liberal institutions.\"</p><p>This story originally published on October 29, 2017.

In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative &amp; Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>&amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see. This is a very serious situation -- will be addressed!''</p><p>  Will. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>News over and over again in the middle of the night.</p><p>  But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)</p><p>  Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.</p><p>  Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.</p><p>  Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.</p><p>  I can vaguely hear the always aggrieved tones of Mr. Trump's tech whisperer, the entrepreneur and <person><nameText>investor Peter Thiel, </nameText></person>somewhere in there, who often goes on about having to move to ... wait for it ... Los Angeles to get away from the lefty groupthink in Northern California. While I am not going to be the one to tell him about those Hollywood types, it is extra rich since he became a billionaire via investing in all those supposed liberals, like those socialists over at Facebook.</p><p>  That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.</p><p>  Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can't get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don't cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can't stand the endless bullying, but let's stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.</p><p>  So whether it's the idea that Twitter ''shadow bans'' right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it's all codswallop.</p><p>  You can look that fine word up on <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold -- and in some cases, dangerous -- ways.</p><p>  It is certainly true that some of tech's egregious sins -- like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Twitter leaders are expected to appear -- need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.</p><p>  But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It's hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.</p><p>  Last week, for example, he tweeted: ''Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people ... People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!''</p><p>  But it's been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn't-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it's probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.</p><p>  Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.</p><p>  And while I kind of get Mr. Trump's demented tirades against what he calls the ''Amazon Washington Post'' -- largely because its chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, utterly ignores the goofy smacks, even as the retail giant only grows in size and power -- keeping tech free to do whatever it wants is beneficial for him.</p><p>  It's certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It's pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)</p><p>  What's most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an ''innoventor'' of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) -- is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.</p><p>  That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.</p><p>  While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.</p><p>  That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.</p><p>  As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: ''For one set, we can't take enough down; for another set, we can't leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.''</p><p>  Which makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.</p><p>  In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.</p><p>  ''They want to take away my voice,'' Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). ''They're not going to take away my social media.''</p><p>  No, Mr. President, they're not.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-774774180830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T50-FKN1-JBG3-62T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/opinion/trump-bias-google-twitter.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/opinion/trump-bias-google-twitter.html</url><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, the new kings are big tech companies, and just like centuries ago, we need a charter to govern them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The digital revolution is the greatest dynamic force in the world today. It affects everything from the intimacies of everyday life to geopolitical struggles and has made the world become one in a way that was never possible before. But at the same time, it is fracturing and dividing. Artificial intelligence and the Internet are the twin driving forces of these changes.</p><p>The evolution of AI has already gone through two distinct stages and is today moving into a third. The first - from the pioneering computing efforts of Alan Turing during World War II until the late 1980s\u00a0- was dominated by governments and academia. The second phase was the emergence of Silicon Valley - \"move fast and break things.\"</p><p>The third phase we are now entering must bring the state and the wider public domain back into the picture. For a while, the positive breakthroughs of digital technologies - greater connectivity among like-minded peers or distant scholars, big data analysis of the genetic code, the convenience of online shopping - took center stage. But the negative aspects have proven to be profound, even though they took time to surface. They include threats to the very tissue of democracy itself - online movements have come to challenge or even displace mainstream political parties. These are emerging at the same time as what look like dramatic advances in machine learning.</p><p>I have been pondering these transformations over the past six months while working as a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence in the U.K. We have interviewed some 60 experts from different backgrounds in industry, academia and the think-tank world. We aimed to distinguish, as much as possible, the hype and more remote, apocalyptic visions of digital transformations from real dangers.</p><p>Two overlapping tasks - each complex and difficult - now face our governments and public agencies. We have to seek to repair the mistakes of the past while preserving dynamism and innovation - no easy task. But at the same time, we must ensure that the new wave of AI-driven innovation is handled in a more proactive fashion, not allowed to rush willy-nilly through our lives.</p><p>The committee's report proposes a far-reaching series of reforms that seeks to find a new balance between innovation and corporate responsibility. It echoes and draws upon legislation already pioneered by the European Union and some national governments, much of which is being incorporated into British law.</p><p>We lay out an overall charter for AI that can frame practical interventions by governments and other public agencies. The main elements of that charter are that AI should:</p><p>These principles form the basis of a cross-sector AI code that should be developed both nationally and internationally. The committee calls for radical intervention to help break down digital corporations' data monopoly and allow individuals greater personal control over their data and how it is deployed.</p><p>A range of policies are suggested as to how such aims can be achieved in a manageable and practical way. For example, the British government has already accepted that data trusts should be set up to share data ethically. A key issue here is how to restructure the National Health System (NHS). Patient privacy must be reconciled, for example, with the use of NHS data for research purposes and the exchange of data between medical specialists. We emphasize that such trusts should incorporate direct citizen representation and consultation. Within the U.K. at least, these principles and proposals should secure a wide measure of cross-party support.</p><p>We also addressed concerns on the geopolitical front, where domestic regulations intersect the practices of other nations. Fake news is not only a deep structural problem in the digital age; it has been directly weaponized by Russia and other countries.\u00a0Forging international agreements over AI is likely to be difficult but extremely important.China, which uses digital tools and social media to further political aims, has the most powerful array of supercomputers in the world and is close to assuming the lead in developing AI. Our report concludes by proposing that a global summit of political leaders should be urgently organized to develop a common framework for the ethical development of AI at the global level.</p><p>The advantages of the digital revolution have been huge and have reshaped our lives, in many respects for the better. As in previous technological revolutions, societies must find a way to reap the benefits of innovation while containing the problems and hazards. A charter that protects the rights and liberties of citizens - a Magna Carta for the digital age -\u00a0is the place to start.</p><p>                          This was produced by                                                  The WorldPost                                                 , a partnership of the                                                  Berggruen Institute                                                  and The Washington Post.                    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-6c0bdb0066f941dfadc7d71425b93813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7G-3J11-DXKP-J3DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><timeReceived>5:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 2, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

'I see a major cyberattack in our digital world in the next three years. It's at that time our [banking] industry will wake up to see the significance of what cyber security is,' he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considered to be a pioneer of mobile banking, Hussain also predicted that Pakistani commercial banks would not come up with anything of significance in the digital space and their customers would force them to open up their systems to APIs [application programing interface] of fintechs. He followed up with one more prediction: these banks will end up buying fintechs as opposed to creating them.</p><p>When it comes to digital banking, Hussain has a knack for seeing the future well in advance. But, are his predictions just plain obvious or alternatively more like a shot in the dark? To find out the rationale behind his predictions, Profit caught up with him later and expanded the discussion further.</p><p>Pakistan's first Unicorn will be a fintech platform play?</p><p>The highest possible chance Pakistan can create a Unicorn will be a fintech platform play, Hussain said. 'We don't have that kind of power in any single app. We may have got an app valued at $100 million or $150 million, but a billion dollar is a big number,' he said explaining why he thinks the country's first Unicorn will be a fintech company.</p><p>Explaining, Citibank's former country head said that a fintech platform, which can develop multiple solutions like those offered by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group will have a real chance of potentially becoming a Unicorn.</p><p>Alibaba Group is the holding company of Ant Financial, the world's largest fintech company valued at $60 billion - that equals four Deutsche banks. Yes, you read that right. Fintechs are typically standalone Internet-based financial services companies that compete with traditional banks in a marketplace. Over the past decade, they have changed the way banking and financial transactions are done thus increasingly getting high valuations by investors.</p><p>'The top five valued companies of America in 2016 were the Googles, the Apples and the Amazons, they are no longer the Exxons, the Fords and the General Motors,' Chris Skinner said explaining how technology has changed things in the last 20 years - he is one of the top 40 most influential people in financial technology and a leading expert on information security. Has Pakistan the potential to produce a Unicorn?</p><p>'Something is changing. The digital platform revolution that we are seeing today\u2026 the integrated open marketplaces, which connect people who have money with those who need money, just as Uber does with cars,' Skinner said in his presentation in the digital banking summit.</p><p>The industrial model of high valuation businesses, which require physical manufacturing of products, has changed and tech companies are frequently becoming high-valued entities, the expert said, backing it with examples, particularly from fintechs.</p><p>Paypal, valued at $48 billion in October 2016, may be the oldest and most established fintech company in America, but it doesn't stop new fintech startups from gaining traction. It is evident from Paypal's new competitor Stripe, which saw its valuation increased from $5 billion in 2015 to $9 billion a year later.</p><p>'Stripe is an API for doing merchants accounts online that's really easy to use. It is expanding rapidly across Asia, which is why its valuation almost doubled in a year,' he added.</p><p>Cutting-edge fintech companies and financial innovation are changing the competitive landscape, and are redrawing the lines of the financial services industry, says Global Fintech Report 2017 by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This growing market segment has already produced many Unicorns, a clear indication fintechs are on a roll. But, has Pakistan got the potential to produce one?</p><p>Can do, says Hussain</p><p>'You have to be cognizant that it can be done,' Hussain said adding as one builds up a billion-dollar business, he should be clear on how much money he is prepared to spend and risks he is willing to take. 'If you do that you are on the right track.'</p><p>Nadeem Hussain himself has invested in startups to exploit the areas that he predicts will soon become relevant. But, are his predictions a case of crying wolf to generate business for his startups or he is actually putting his money where his mouth is?</p><p>There are currently 27 fintech companies in Pakistan, out of which seven belong to Planet N Group, which is 90 percent-owned by Hussain, His holding company is in the process of launching Publishex. This upcoming startup has integration with Telenor, Zong and Jazz and will offer nano payments based on credit balance on customer's SIM as opposed to his mobile account.</p><p>'They [banks] haven't created any model that looks at the long tail customers, which is typically what the fintechs look at. That is, small ticket items with high value,' Hussain said - and he seems to be doing exactly that. Publishex's integration with top three telecom operators would mean a target market of 122 million SIMs, their combined user base as of May.</p><p>However, Hussain's Planet N is not the only contender for first movers' advantage in the fintech race. Financial Ninja (Finja) is another interesting fintech startup to watch out for.</p><p>'We wish to digitalize the money. What Whats App has done to messaging, we want to do to payments in Pakistan,' Finja's Founder and CEO Qasif Shahid told Profit in an interview. His company, in partnership with Finca Microfinance Bank, is developing a digital payments platform SimSim.</p><p>Digitalizing money, making Pakistan cash-light</p><p>Shahid aspires to make Pakistan a cash-light economy in the next three to four years and he chose to do it with 'free payments' through SimSim. 'Our value to the microfinance bank is that through this opportunity the bank has to grow exponentially that has never happened before for a microfinance bank,' he said.</p><p>Giving background of his statement, the CEO said microfinance banks have failed the world because their business model is analog. For example, he said Professor Mohammad Yunus made this model 40 years ago in Bangladesh but this model had only 300 million global customers during this time. By contrast, cellular companies gained five billion in 20 years. 'That type of growth is very elusive for a microfinance bank on its own,' Shahid said referring to the latter.</p><p>Right now, Finja has 20,000 users and a few hundred merchants on its platform but it believes if e-commerce remains free, there is a real chance that 100 million people will reinvent their relationship with money in three to four years - that's the market it aims to tap into.</p><p>The numbers for fintechs may look small at the moment but Hussain thinks it will take one to three years for these companies to fully evolve and provide full range of services in payments, savings, credit, wealth management, and information - the five areas of fintech that people grow in globally.</p><p>Standalone fintechs have been a major business threat to financial services sector, but one can't write off cellular operators when it comes to digital payments. According to the PwC study, telcos and big tech companies are seen as potentially large disruptors to the banking sector because they are able to innovate at a far faster pace than incumbents.</p><p>'Telcos can play a big part in the digital revolution from a fintech prospective,' Hussain said. They will end up giving voice for free because data is going to drive the fintech play, he said. They have a large customer base (140 million), they need to translate this data through machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to create solutions for their customers' financial need, he added.</p><p>Telcos have long been dominating the digital payments scene in the country. The country's first mobile payments platform EasyPaisa of Telenor Bank alone accounts for 70 percent of the market. It claims to have processed five per cent of Pakistan's GDP in 2016 at more than 1 million transactions a day - the country's official GDP was $300 billion as measured in May, 2017.</p><p>'We are aiming to digitize almost 100,000 merchants by 2020,' President and CEO Telenor Bank Ali Riaz Chaudhry told Profit - currently there are only 35,000 merchants that accept debit or credit cards.</p><p>Powered by a total retail merchant universe of nearly two million, Pakistan's retail payments market is estimated to be more than $150 billion - this is nearly 10 percent more than Hungary's entire economic output of 2014.</p><p>By contrast, the digital payment penetration remains much smaller at $150 million or mere 0.1 percent - that is almost all retail transactions are done in cash.</p><p>Bullish on the future of fintechs</p><p>Hussain may have the most bullish take on future of fintechs, but he doesn't seem too optimistic about commercial banks' understanding of threats facing digital banking.</p><p>The Planet N's founder says Pakistani banks don't think they are vulnerable and they are not even bothering about information security. 'Not a single [Pakistani] financial institution or telco was using their services,' Hussain said, referring to Pakistan-based information security companies that are developing solutions for clients all over the world but not contacted by local financial institutions.</p><p>These banks are using technology that just feels comfortable, the banker said. They may have their own systems but the fact that these banks are complacent makes them vulnerable, he said. 'Banks think the safeguards they have in place are adequate,' he added implying it may not be a good idea.</p><p>When Hussain was running Tameer Microfinance Bank's EasyPaisa service, the bank was hacked. As a result, it had to bring its system down, and spend a lot of money to fix it. 'We had a high-powered telco as a partner with sophisticated firewalls and hacking pulse, but we still got hacked,' Hussain said - he refused to reveal the details though. If a sophisticated player can get hacked, other places, which have weak cyber security protocols, are certainly vulnerable, he said.</p><p>'I think only an attack, and hopefully I am wrong, will shake us up to get us to the right level of cyber security,' Hussain said. And his statement doesn't come without a basis. The banker relates his observation to the experience he had at a commercial bank where he had seen, firsthand, sophistication of cyber hacking - the recent developments in online security tell a similar story.</p><p>According to a post by information security research firm, SecurityIntelligence, there has been a fundamental shift in the manner online crimes are taking place and they are happening at a scale not seen before. These crimes are committed by groups of people who use increasingly sophisticated techniques and collaborate with each other to target financial institutions.</p><p>'There is a real chance that a bank will fall in 2017 as attacks get more advanced and the hackers get further inside the network,' said Aden Davies, Director of Portfolio Management at 11FS, a top-notch fintech consultancy company based out of United Kingdom. 'The challenges faced by SWIFT in 2016 show that critical infrastructure is at risk and it only takes a handful of weaknesses to be exploited for major damage to be done,' he said referring to the Bangladesh bank heist.</p><p>In February 2016, cyber criminals stole nearly $100 million from Bangladesh's central bank, which was connected with Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), one of the most secured information and money transfer networks globally. Shortly after that incident, Russian officials disclosed that hackers stole more than $31 million from their central bank and commercial banks. In November of the same year, \u00a32.5 million were stolen from 9,000 accounts of Tesco Bank, England.</p><p>Looming threat</p><p>Though major incidents, these are only a handful of examples of a looming threat facing financial institutions. Media reports suggest 2015 and 2016 were the busiest years in terms of cyber attacks on banks. And that's only the beginning. Given hackers had developed advanced techniques to breach existing security protocols, SWIFT warned that these attacks were set to rise globally.</p><p>Lo and behold! Barely five months into 2017, a major global attack 'WannaCry' already infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries across the world. Last month's ransomware attack exploited a security flaw in Microsoft XP operating system. The attackers locked access to user files and demanded the target pay $300 if they wanted their files decrypted.</p><p>The attack wasn't targeted on Pakistan but the attackers did come here, Hussain said- and that was even before his prediction.</p><p>We could not find any official data about how many attacks have taken place in the past or value of losses suffered or amount recovered by banks. The State Bank of Pakistan's response to Profit's queries - shared with them three weeks in advance - was awaited till the filing of this report. Three of the top five commercial banks, we contacted for this article, didn't entertain us either, leaving many</p><p>important questions unanswered.</p><p>However, industry sources say cyberattacks are taking place on a daily basis and there is no system in place for sharing of such information or dealing with a sophisticated attack.</p><p>'Many cyberattacks are taking place in the country already. Our user data, such as credit card information, is being used by hackers on a daily basis but no one is sharing that information,' said Barrister Zahid Jamil, an international expert on cybercrime.</p><p>Pakistani banks, at least a few of them, are now looking set to transition from basic bricks and mortar model to the much-advanced digital banking, making online security even more relevant. But, almost all the experts we spoke to echoed Hussain's views, agreeing Pakistan has one of the world's weakest information security systems in place.</p><p>'One needs to make sure they have barriers to avoid such attacks and minimize the damage,' Group Chairman Standard Chartered PLC, Jose Vinals told Profit in his recent visit to Pakistan - Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is the first bank in Pakistan to move to internet banking.</p><p>Though he acknowledged banks all over the world are attacked every day, Vinals disagreed that banks were taking it lightly. 'Cyberattacks are at the top of the agenda for all international banks and many local banks in many countries of the world,' he said recalling his reflections from the meetings he had with heads of banks and regulatory bodies in many countries of the world.</p><p>The SCB's global chief said, they have upgraded their security system recently to make it more robust. 'It's impossible to say we are 100 percent protected, but we are doing our best to avoid such attacks,' he said.</p><p>Two-factor authentication, the way to go</p><p>When it comes to cyber security of banks, some experts say two-factor authentication is an effective and nearly foolproof technology because hackers can't access the target's mobile phone, where the banks send temporary codes. However, not all banks use this technology. Even those who do have limited its use to funds transfer while accessing one's account doesn't require this additional layer of security.</p><p>'In online banking there should be two to three factor authentication as opposed to the current practice where you go online, enter your password and access your account,' Jamil said. He argues that PIN and password model only ensures user authentication, but it doesn't tell if a document is tempered - and that is apparently what happened in Bangladesh. SWIFT says it detected a simple malware on the bank's computer systems that targeted a PDF reader, used by the bank to check statement messages. Using malware, the hackers bypassed primary risk controls by tampering with the statements.</p><p>'The way they [banks] email monthly statements to clients without any password protection is very unsecure,' Jamil said of all Pakistani banks including SCB's local operations. The barrister says banks should use digital signature, which is more secured and ensures encryption of documents so that no one can tamper them.</p><p>Use of decentralized ledger system can be another way to prevent against cyberattacks, according to Skinner, the information security expert. 'Decentralize the structure of the system into lots of different servers around the network, rather than having one central server that runs the system,' he said during the digital banking summit while responding to a question. When a company has hundreds of points then hackers have to attack all of those to get a breach, which makes the institution far more secured than when they have only one central point, he added.</p><p>Other experts say hackers are more skilled in cyber security, therefore, only a combination of best technologies or an emergency response team, as opposed to a single solution, can help form a sound strategy. Apparently, Pakistan has none.</p><p>'We don't have any financial computer emergency response team (CERT) in Pakistan at the moment. If I can be specific, not a single bank is prepared to deal with any major cyberattack on their systems,' Jamil said.</p><p>Under CERT banks share data with each other and depute people on information sharing on real-time basis to address threats. In fact, the handling of recent attacks by private sector and the regulator indicates such information is restricted from becoming public.</p><p>For example, EasyPaisa and JazzCash, the digital payment platforms of two large cellular service providers (Telenor and Jazz respectively) were hacked but they didn't share any information with the industry. In fact, mobile accounts of JazzCash agents were compromised twice in a month despite the company's claim to have fixed the loopholes exploited by hackers in the first incident - but they chose not to alert others in either case.</p><p>Similarly, the SMS service can be useful as customers can alert their bank in case of unauthorized access by hackers, but this is a paid feature that comes with a federal tax, which discourages consumers to avail this security layer.</p><p>Most banks in Pakistan have outsourced cyber security and call centers to third parties, which is dangerous from a security point of view because they are not bank employees, Jamil said. We could not figure out how much money banks are spending on information security and what their strategy is because none of those contacted, including the regulator, answered our queries.</p><p>'If a major cyber attack takes place on Pakistani banks, it will be a huge economic loss, it will be a loss of trust in electronic banking, and hurt the whole e-commerce sector,' Jamil said.</p><p>Banks not coming up with anything significant in digital arena</p><p>Hussain's prediction about a cyberattack on financial institutions wasn't the only bitter pill for bankers to swallow. His harshest forecast, which may have made bankers in the room rather uncomfortable, was the one about commercial banks' inability to do anything significant in the digital arena anytime soon.</p><p>Asked to explain, the founder of EasyPaisa said banks' business model doesn't make them hungry for fintechs. The numbers he shared seem to agree.</p><p>More than two-thirds of banks' earnings come from government treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which require no brains. In a country of 200 million, there are only 1.8 million active banking customers, 40,000 point of sale machines, and 1.1 million credit card customers.</p><p>'It has been the same for the last 15 years,' Hussain said.</p><p>Most banks are in five big cities and are not expanding geographically. The total SME lending from banks has come down from 17 per cent to six per cent while credit to agriculture remains under six per cent.</p><p>'No one has really come up with an innovative model for a long time and this state of play will remain unchanged in near future,' Hussain said pointing towards the budget deficit, which forces the government to borrow. The government remains the single-largest borrower of banks for over a decade now.</p><p>'I have a sense that we [banks] will stay dependent on the government,' former finance minister Shaukat Tarin told Profit in a recent interview. Banking has a small footprint in the economy, for its coverage is only 33 percent of the GDP, he said. 'Some of these banks have almost forgotten how to lend and it will take them a long time to build the capacity to lend to customers.'</p><p>When the central bank started reducing its monetary policy rate in mid-2015, banks, which were enjoying 5 to 7 percent risk-free spreads, suffered notable losses in the years that followed. As a result, they shifted focus back to consumer lending.</p><p>Hussain, however, says most of this lending is going to the salaried class and not the self-employed people.</p><p>'By and large, expecting commercial banks, barring a few, to become tech savvy and provide their customers a digital journey is a long ask,' Hussain said.</p><p>The global stats for legacy banking seem to support his point of view. Only three percent amongst CEOs of leading banks have professional technology experience, according to Skinner, the fintech expert. Even at the board level, the number is only six per cent. 'When you have no one in the top management who understands fintech, you are fatally flawed,' the expert said. This, he says is the biggest problem for banks wanting to move to fintechs.</p><p>'The real challenge for banks is how to play in a marketplace when they are playing on a proprietary avenue,' he said adding it is difficult because it requires change in thinking and culture.</p><p>Agreeing with Skinner, Bank Alfalah Limited's then CEO Atif Bajwa said, the challenges of moving to digital banking essentially emanate from the old people in the boardroom. It reflects a mindset, traditional model of revenue, and traditional ways of delivering to the customers, he said.</p><p>'We have been in this comfort zone for so long that we are finding it difficult to transition very quickly,' Bajwa said, admitting the industry needs more people in the C-suite who understand fintech, which is the number one issue they face.</p><p>The legacy banking and old mindset at the board level may have been hindering the transition to digital banking, but that is not the challenge facing the industry. For example, BAFL had the most aggressive approach in expanding its digital footprint recently, but it still faced problems in certain aspects of digital banking.</p><p>When Bajwa took charge in 2012, digital was one of the two major areas of focus for the new management. They were one of the first banks to come into Point of Sale (PoS) machines business and grew their footprint very fast, according to Amaar Naveed Ikhlas, Head of Digital Banking at BAFL, which now accounts for 60 percent of the PoS machines in the market.</p><p>'To become the best transactional bank you have to make transactions easy, cheap, and user friendly in every way. And to do that, you need to go digital,' Ikhlas said, explaining why they focussed on digital.</p><p>BAFL had been able make some inroads to digital by increasing its ATM network from 300 in 2012 to 650 now. It makes payments to 350,000 EOBI customers and 1.1 million BISP beneficiaries besides moving Rs20 billion government to people in quarterly payments.</p><p>Despite notable success on digital front, Ikhlas doesn't seem to be happy with the existing digital payments ecosystem. They launched their own platform Mobile Paisa in collaboration with Warid, but it faded away after the latter's acquisition by Mobilink. Eventually, they had to continue their services through EasyPaisa agents' network because of customer convenience. But that didn't turn out to be viable for them.</p><p>Government pays BAFL and it puts the money into customers' accounts who either go to ATMs or agents to withdraw that money. 'For them this transaction is free and we compensate the agent from the fee we charge from government,' Ikhlas said. That is of every Rs10, up to 60 percent goes to the agents of EasyPaisa. Explaining, he said Jazz and Telenor let other players use their agents and charge the cost of management, which has opened up an opportunity for them to make more money at the expense of smaller players. 'The game is just of the fee business, there is no float,' he said.</p><p>Ikhlas is not the only one complaining about the duopoly of EasyPaisa and JazzCash. 'When you are charging Rs60 on a local remittance of Rs1,000, that is six per cent, it becomes very expensive,' Ufone's CEO Rainer Rathgeber said in an apparent reference to market leader EasyPaisa.</p><p>Speaking to a group of journalists in Karachi earlier this year, Rathgeber said, 98 percent of all fee is going to the agents and rest to the telcos or banks, which is not a successful model. 'The poorest is paying the highest and retailers are the only beneficiaries,' he said. This is one of the reasons why Ufone, the parent company of Ubank, is more into microfinance, and into payments, the CEO said.</p><p>Ikhlas, the BAFL's digital banking head, says the current mechanisms support big players like EasyPaisa and JazzCash but other players are not able to do it. He went a step further in suggesting people in Pakistan didn't do banking through mobile as it is done in other successful countries in the world.</p><p>'If we ask EasyPaisa about how many accounts are there in Telenor Bank, they might say 10 million, but how many are actively used is a different story,' he said, adding, agents' accounts are there, but not of consumers. In over the counter transaction, which still account for more than half of total branchless banking transactions, people at both ends are actually giving and taking actual cash. If one looks at over the counter transactions, the fee is under threat, he said, adding only Easy Paisa and JazzCash will survive because they have invested so much money in this.</p><p>In digital banking, the growth didn't come where it should have been. 'We are still stuck at the point for digital transactions to take a leap,' he said.</p><p>Shifting strategies</p><p>Banks are very proprietary right now, but over time, they will open up their system so that fintechs can integrate with them, Hussain says. And this, according to him, will be driven by customer pressure or regulatory requirement.</p><p>'If customers demand their information to be available with a particular fintech with their consent, the banks will have to comply or they will go to another bank,' Hussain said. 'Some banks will open up voluntarily because they see this as a business and build up a model where they make money but others will be forced to do it eventually,' he said. This has happened in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and other parts of the world, he said.</p><p>According to the PwC's latest study on fintechs, many financial services leaders fear losing business to innovators, starting with payments, fund transfer and personal finance sectors. The vast majority (88 percent) believed that part of their business is at risk to standalone fintech companies. 'This business risk is due to developments in fintech and has grown to an estimated 24 percent of revenues,' the study says.</p><p>'Innovation is coming from outside financial services and being driven by a variety of sources including tech companies, e-retailers, and social media platforms,' it says, adding this approach certainly has been prevalent in some Asian markets.</p><p>Hussain says a lot of banks have jumped into branchless banking but that is not necessarily a profitable business.

It\u2019s something Axon\u2019s ethics board report fought to change. According to the ethics board report, in early conversations about facial recognition, Axon initially argued that it \u201ccould not dictate to customers how products were used, nor its customers\u2019 policies, and that it could not feasibly patrol misuse of its product.\u201d That\u2019s Big Tech\u2019s version of \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people.\u201d And it\u2019s a view that\u2019s very widely held across the industry. </p><p>Mr. Friedman hopes that Axon\u2019s pledge will force other vendors to think about where the new technology might be headed and how it could impact the most vulnerable. \u201cWe want them to remember that just because you can build it, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d </p><p>The ultimate goal of the ethics board goes a step further: forcing the company to see that the customer for Axon products is not law enforcement but \u201cthe community that those law enforcement and public safety organizations serve.\u201d</p><p>Axon\u2019s ban isn\u2019t necessarily foolproof. An Axon spokesperson confirmed that law enforcement officials could potentially download Axon body cam footage and then transfer it to a third-party service, like Amazon\u2019s Rekognition. However, Eric Piza, an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that the process is time-consuming and requires spending the money for yet another tech service. \u201cIf six officers respond to a scene, that\u2019s hours of manpower and extra expense, which might reduce the likelihood they use the technology,\u201d he said.</p><p>Still, Mr. Piza sees Axon\u2019s moratorium as an important step. \u201cEveryone\u2019s concerned about big data policing and that they put privacy above short-term financials is not something that we see enough.\u201d</p><p>Axon\u2019s decision won\u2019t completely stop law enforcement from using the technology \u2014 police departments could still use it on surveillance videos, for instance. And true progress will have to come from regulation at the city, state or federal level. </p><p>But the move demonstrates the potential for independent ethics boards to help guide technology companies whose products could drastically alter public life.

The prevailing school of thought on antitrust laws cannot reign in Big Tech. Focus should be given to other forms of anti-competitive behaviour.   Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty   The US Congressional hearings on the \u201cAnticompetitive Behaviour\u201d of American tech giants namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google concluded last week with US Congressmen questioning their respective business practices. The hearings revealed the egregious practices adopted by these tech giants to dominate the digital market and to eliminate any potential competition using data. While what follows next is still unknown, a more detailed report on the findings of the year-long investigation is expected by August or September. The report will also substantiate the allegations with testimonies of past and present employees as well as internal communications and documents concerning business practices and key decisions taken.   Regulation of Big Tech companies is increasingly becoming inevitable as they wield enormous power over democracy, society and trade. The hearings held in the US are instructive for other countries and government officials who are looking to regulate the behaviour of big tech companies in their region. Countries such as India and South Korea are launching investigations. European Commissioner for Competiton Margrethe Vestager opened an investigation into Amazon earlier this year focusing on whether the company\u2019s collection of data from merchants using its platform represented an unfair advantage. Now, the European Commission is thinking about tailoring its antitrust rules specifically to deal with such data sharing.   The hearings held in the US are instructive for other countries and government officials who are looking to regulate the behaviour of big tech companies in their region.   Here are some of points that regulators and governments need to consider as they attempt to understand these businesses and their anti-competitive behaviour.   The problem of many monopolies   Predominantly, there is a need for regulators to re-define and expand the scope of what is considered anti-competitive behaviour by companies. Competition law scholar Lina M. Khan directs attention to the fact that the current antitrust laws only measure competition through price and output but ignores the larger picture \u2014 the structural ways in which companies like Amazon are able to engage in anti-competitive behaviour. Khan explains that current discourse on antitrust law is dominated by the Chicago School of Antitrust Law whose principle states that the competition law should serve consumer interests above all else and the law should protect competition rather than individual competitors. A frequent defence that Big Tech companies assert when faced with antitrust investigations is \u2014 they are not a monopoly since they compete with their offline counterparts. To this end, Amazon cannot be a monopoly since it competes with the larger unorganised retail market and its participants. Google, in its defence into an Indian antitrust investigation in 2018, said that it does not have a monopoly in the online advertising space. Given the large advertising sector, it only accounts for a small percent as opposed to the offline players. It is becoming increasingly evident that despite the presence of competitors in the market, big tech companies are not ameliorating the competitive-ness of the market. Benedict Evans, an independent analyst and former partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, captured this contradiction well in a tweet: \u201cThe great thing about tech monopolies is how many there are to choose from.\u201d   A frequent defence that Big Tech companies assert when faced with antitrust investigations is \u2014 they are not a monopoly since they compete with their offline counterparts.   Big Tech companies own and operate marketplaces or act as intermediaries, and their behviour is increasingly looking more like monopsonies rather than monopolies. A monopsony results when a single company is the sole buyer of goods and services. For example, the governments act as a monopsony for defence sector for the purchase of weapons and defence equipment. Monopsonies distort the market with unfair contracts to suppliers and labour wages. Due to the dominant position that tech-mediated companies enjoy, they dictate the terms of the deal to third-party vendors and sellers. Thus, tech companies can set prices below cost for a product as compared to their offline retail counterparts. In Amazon\u2019s case, third-party sellers are compelled to use Amazon\u2019s in-house logistics services and participate in discount sales. Similarly, app-based taxi companies like Uber, Ola and Lyft can price their services lower by providing discounts to customers, while drivers on their platform are subject to unfair wage contracts with opaque algorithms dictating their behaviour and routes.   A marketplace and participant    As the hearings continued, Bezos was further questioned about Amazon\u2019s practice of accessing and using third-party seller data to launch competing products. \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business. But I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated,\u201d Bezos said.   \u201cYou have access to data that far exceeds the sellers on your platforms with whom you compete. You can track consumer habits, interests, even what consumers clicked on, but then didn\u2019t buy. You have access to the entirety of sellers\u2019 pricing and inventory information past, present, and future. And you dictate the participation of third-party sellers on your platform. So, you can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\u201d Congresswoman Jayapal said to Bezos during the hearing.   These sentiments were echoed during the Competition Commision of India\u2019s (CCI) investigation of e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart. CCI\u2019s investigation largely focused on the terms of engagement which forces sellers to discount their products. With this in mind, these marketplaces favoured their own in-house brands through private labels. The CCI questioned the ability of these platforms to maintain neutrality due to the inherent conflict in acting as an intermediary and a marketplace participant.   Source: The Economist   As the hearings proceeded, Apple was also grilled on launching competing products. Congressman Lucy McBath asked Apple CEO Tim Cook, why the company changed its rules which saw the removal of many parental control apps and then launching its own service ScreenTime. Cook defended the rule as the company had privacy concerns on the technologies that the apps used and exposure of children\u2019s data to third parties and that these apps were restored and that there were more than 30 apps in the same space competing with Apple\u2019s service. However, Congressman McBath questioned and countered on why the apps were restored after six months. \u201cAnd of course, six months is truly an eternity for small businesses to be shut down, even worse if all the while a larger competitor is actually taking away customers,\u201d she added.   An offline analogy can be found in in supermarkets where stores can launch their own brand for a particular product and may prioritise shelf space for their brand. The online version of this can be to alter search results to prompt users to buy their in-house brand.   For regulators, ensuring neutrality of platforms/marketplaces and balancing privacy concerns will be a challenge. As technology platforms play an increasing role in our lives, regulators will have to act more responsibly to ensure platforms do not violate privacy of their users and ensure safety. But at the same time, by the very nature of being platforms can collect incredible amount of data of their participants and the behaviour of their users. Nothing prevents these platforms from creating their own competing products and they may be very well in their right to do launch them. An offline analogy can be found in in supermarkets where stores can launch their own brand for a particular product and may prioritise shelf space for their brand. The online version of this can be to alter search results to prompt users to buy their in-house brand. To ensure impartiality, regulators can ask e-commerce companies to divulge information on their search algorithms. However, this may open another can of worms as this move would infringe on companies\u2019 intellectual property.   Imitation isn\u2019t flattering anymore   For over a decade, Big Tech companies were known as \u201cdrivers of innovation\u201d or to fairly put across \u2014 they are working relentlessly to minimise the chances of another Amazon or Facebook. Through their track record, a similar pattern can be observed wherein tech giants are seen cloning features/innovations introduced by other smaller businesses, often startups. For instance, in 2011 Amazon reached out to Vocalife LLC\u2019s inventor to explore the possibility of investing in a speech detection technology. Vocalife LLC met with Amazon\u2019s employees and discussed its microphone technology and provided proprietary information, including engineering data. Shortly after the meeting, Amazon\u2019s employees stopped responding to their e-mails. In November 2014, Amazon Echo was launched. While for start-ups, an opportunity like this is a breakthrough moment there lacks little knowledge on the power and dominance these big tech companies have on the market. There needs to be more scrutiny on the features that companies are introducing to allow small businesses to innovate and thrive.   Similarly, in the case of Facebook, around the same time when Facebook was working to develop a Facebook camera-app, Instagram was launched. Bearing in mind the threat of Instagram as a potential competitor, in 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram. At this step, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal accused Facebook of \u201cbeing a monopoly power that harvests and monetises data, and then uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals.\u201d   Our increased reliance has led to the gradual forming of each cog in the large machine that these companies are today.   What we are witnessing is the Big 4 Tech Giants successfully creating platforms that have impacted not only small businesses but also consumers, wherein a single decision can have affected the hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways. Our increased reliance has led to the gradual forming of each cog in the large machine that these companies are today. Now, through access to information about marketplaces, use of disruptive digital infrastructure to surveil other companies to prevent rivalry and by exacerbating the fear of exclusion among small businesses \u2014 they have replaced these small cogs (here, small businesses) with their own single giant machine.   Regulation of Big Tech companies is increasingly becoming inevitable as they wield enormous power over democracy, society and trade. The pandemic has illustrated the dramatic dependency consumers and governments have on these tech giants, and this has placed their \u201canti-competitive behaviour\u201d under the scanner. It is critical for administrators to review extant regulatory frameworks in order to ensure a level playing field in the digital market. The historic anti-trust hearing is a step in this direction, but its denouement has also raised questions as to what will follow next. Will we witness a reduction in the dominance of the tech giants, or will they continue to distort the market and stamp out competition? With the US presidential elections slated in November amidst the pandemic, will anti-trust be a priority for the elected president?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42830584073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KD-JB41-F07F-83KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Observer Research Foundation</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thank you, Janice, for the kind introduction. It's been a joy to work with you over the last 10 months.  And thank you, Chair Yellen, for your insightful remarks, and your inspiring presence in our profession.  </p><p>      It's an honor to work with all of you today in this room.  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come together and think about the very important issue before us; diversity in the economics profession.  </p><p>      I know and respect the work that many of you have done, and I am excited to map out a plan of action with you.  The board, and in particular, Deputy Director Janice Shack-Marquez, and Director David Wilcox, have shown remarkable leadership in bringing us together today to open a profession-wide dialogue about diversity.  </p><p>      The commitment displayed by all the officers I've met with here is invigorating and powerful.  In this room we have these esteemed board staff, Federal Reserve Bank presidents and research directors, chairs of top economics departments from around the country, economists who have made significant contributions to understanding and addressing diversity, and leading scholars from other disciplines.  </p><p>      We have the opportunity today to put our diverse heads together and produce lasting change in our profession.  Echoing the chair's remarks, our objective is to create a profession that recruits and promotes the individuals best able to bring the energy, fresh insights and renewals, that our discipline needs to be healthy and thrive.    </p><p>      Over the course of the day, we will hear from a dream team of speakers and panelists who will share their research and their work on the ground.  I am truly excited to attend this conference.  They will expose us to examples of successful diversity initiatives in economics and around academia.    </p><p>      The presentations will help us understand the impediments to diversity and will, importantly, introduce us to evidence-based interventions we can support.  Listen with the goal of developing a list of actions and initiatives that you believe hold promise as being practicable and effective.  </p><p>      In the afternoon, we will have opportunities to share and refine our ideas through group discussions.  By the end of the day, each of us should be able to identify several initiatives, large or small, which excite us.    </p><p>      To make it concrete, set a personal goal of writing down two specific actions, one each of the personal and departmental levels, that you are willing to adopt to help our profession attract and develop the best people and best ideas.  In my talk this morning, I will provide background information and a framework to organize and develop knowledge through the rest of the day.    </p><p>      All right.  So now I get to be a teacher rather than a speaker, much more practice at speaking.  I want this to be an academic conference.  I want us to converse.  If you want to ask me questions during the presentation, feel free afterwards or in conversation later.  </p><p>      All right.  So my presentation has three parts.  First, I present data on diversity in the profession.  And in the next section, I briefly discuss possible consequences of having a more or less diverse profession.    </p><p>      In the last section, I lay the groundwork for our plan of attack. I offer an economist's take on the diversity literature produced in a wide variety of fields, highlighting strands of diversity research that may be less familiar, and connecting them to the logic and research that we economists have done.  </p><p>      First, a note on the meaning of the term \"diversity.\"  While certainly other kinds of diversity are important and productive, our focus today is on groups that have been historically under-represented in our profession and in our country; women, African-Americans and Hispanics.  </p><p>      The inclusion of people and perspectives from these groups is essential to the vitality of our profession and policymaking.  But as we learn about the barriers faced by members of these groups, we develop general knowledge that is transferrable, facilitating the inclusion of the best people and the best ideas from all groups.  </p><p>      Can you hear me if I step away from the mike?  Good, all right. How are we doing?  What are our numbers?  Well, big tech firms have a reputation of being boys clubs.  Yahoo -- all right, let's skip Yahoo for a moment.  Google, Twitter, Apple, 70 percent of their workforces are male.  </p><p>      What do you think our profession looks like?  What percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors at colleges and universities in this country are female?    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Someone studied before the test.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  True, true.  All right.  So there are my numbers, my cute graphic.  All right.  So calculated maybe slightly differently.  But 22 percent in the most recent academic year are of tenured and tenure- track faculty are women.    </p><p>      What about racial and ethnic minority, black or Hispanic economists?  What percentage do you think that is?  Ten?  Oh, less than 10?  Do I hear any others?  Five.  </p><p>      These numbers, by the way, are from the UAQ (ph).  Some of you fill that out every year, some of you don't.  So we do have a problem with response rate, missing data.  But the numbers I calculate there are fairly consistent year to year, and across other surveys as well. So this is an accurate impression (inaudible) an accurate number.  </p><p>      So maybe it's a legacy effect.  Maybe over time we'll diversify a bit more.  So let's get a sense of what the younger cohorts are showing.    </p><p>      Looking at new Ph.D.s over the last three years, 33 percent are female.  It's a pretty low number.  And it does not compare well to other disciplines.  What's happening in other fields is they're represented political science, 48 percent.  Then (ph) Ph.D.s, 50 percent female.  </p><p>      Generally, folks are surprised.  Racially, we see a similar pattern.  For new Ph.D.s, 8 percent of new Ph.D.s -- this is looking at U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- are black or Hispanic.  If we include temporary residents, the total drops to 3 percent.    </p><p>      In the other disciplines, 17 and 12 respectively across the political science and the STEM fields.  \"STEM\" means science, technology, engineering and math.    </p><p>      I'm sorry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Oh, sure, sure, sure.  So if the numbers here -- 8 percent, 17 percent, 12 percent -- exclude new Ph.D.s by temporary residents, if we include those Ph.D. recipients, the numbers drop to 3 percent, 13 percent, and 8 percent.  So we do have a high participation rate in our discipline of temporary residents in Ph.D. programs.  </p><p>      So maybe even younger cohorts will save us.  All right.  So let's move back a stage in the pipeline and look at undergraduate students. Any guesses?    </p><p>      Better.  All right.  So what do you think the number is for econ majors who are female?  What percentage?  Thirty to 40, yes.  How do you think that compares to the other disciplines?  Poorly?  In a word, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So depending on how inclusive we are when we consider what a STEM major is changes the numbers slightly, but not very much at all.  So it is true physics, and slightly less diverse than we are in these dimensions, but not a whole lot less.    </p><p>      And math, for instance, I think 48 percent of math majors are female.  So we're behind.  We're doing poorly.  All right.  Here, black and Hispanic econ majors constitute 12 percent; political science, 24; STEM, 20 percent.  </p><p>      OK.  Well, maybe this is not great, but getting better.  No. Over the last 50 years almost, we see the proportion of econ majors who are female.  We experienced a sharp increase in the '70s, but since have plateaued.   </p><p>      There's really no reason to believe change will occur without distinct, intentional action on our parts.  We see a similar message when we look at racial and ethnic diversity amongst undergraduate students.  Economics is behind -- behind all majors, and specifically here, behind political science and STEM majors.  And there's little upward trend.  </p><p>      Convinced that it was worth the trip today?  So far, so good, or so bad?  So we have a problem.  Does it matter?  Yes, problems matter.   </p><p>      We see data.  Do they matter?  What are the possible consequences of the numbers that we've seen, the lack of diversity in our discipline?  Who are they?  Who are these people?  </p><p>      Nobeloriates (ph) in economics, 75 of them over the last 46 years.  So what are some possible consequences?  Just hypothesize, speculate.  What are some possible consequences of (inaudible) economists?  </p><p>      Not being as diverse as the rest of the population.  Sure. Anybody?  You don't see yourself there.  What effect does that have on students?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Eloquently said, and captures I think all three of these dimensions of consequence, or maybe six dimensions, right?  The consequences of the lack of diversity in our profession are both inequity and inefficiency.    </p><p>      It's not just about being nice to certain people, to include them in our fun work.  But it's about getting efficient allocations through the people who join our profession in creating the body of knowledge we are responsible for expanding, and in making government policy.  </p><p>      So around the academy, within economics and outside, researchers have been looking at the consequences of not diversifying groups.  The consequences of homogeneity.  And the research takes two strands.    </p><p>      Well, of course we want to pull from 100 percent of the talent pool.  That's a given.  But it has consequences even beyond that issue.  And I've kind of given you a couple representative papers within each strand.  </p><p>      The first strand says diversity brings a greater range of insights and perspectives.  If we have a broader group of people, we have a broader set of ideas.    </p><p>      The second strand says there's something special about mixed groups.  It changes group dynamics.  The behavior of individuals is different depending on the composition of the group in which they're (inaudible).  </p><p>      And yes, there are challenges to being a mixed group; in communication, maybe in trust.  But there are also distinct benefits proved by laboratory research and on the ground.  Some of the research has problems with looking for causation.  But others very distinctly show that mixed groups are more successful in solving problems, especially complex problems, in part because the participants work harder, spend longer, prepare more, than in homogeneous groups.    </p><p>      So I'd be happy to answer questions about any of these papers later.  But at this point I'm trying to give a high-level overview and let you know that details exist.    </p><p>      I want to show you details from one paper.  You may know it. May, McGarvey and Weibels (ph) recently surveyed all AEA members with Ph.D.s working in the U.S., Ph.D.s from U.S. economic departments. Pretty similar group, except they disaggregated survey responses by gender.  </p><p>      I've chosen four items.  There were many, many items, most of which had distinct, statistically-significant differences in responses.  Along the bottom, I showed statements.  And the respondents were free to respond on a scale from one to five whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement.  </p><p>      So for instance, you can see that women were 21 percentage points more likely to disagree with the statement that the U.S. has an excessive amount of government regulation of economic activity.  Even more striking, my daughter said this is the only statistic I had to show all day.  </p><p>      With the statement, \"Job opportunities for men and women in the U.S. are approximately equal,\" 58 percent of female economists disagreed with that statement, 16 percent of male economists...  </p><p>      In questions about economic principles and theory, there was similarity amongst respondents, but disagreement on interpretation of economic outcomes, and on recommendations for policy work different, even after controlling these numbers, control for vintage of degree, place of employment, and so on.  </p><p>      So we have a problem, that's the bad news.  The good new is there's something we can do about it.  What can we do?  Well, we can patch the pipeline, or try.  So this is a familiar analogy to those working not only in economics, but in many other disciplines, for thinking about what happens to people on their way to us.    </p><p>      And they might start in high school or college, and move forward, and perhaps take a Ph.D. program, and perhaps complete it, and then perhaps go into the academy, and perhaps (inaudible) tenure-track job, and perhaps get tenure, and ultimately promotion.  And there's been a lot of excellent research on that process, understanding why perhaps women and minorities leak out at higher rates than do others.  </p><p>      There's been a lot of excellent work on initiatives designed to address those identified problems.  But I think the framing of the issue as a pipeline causes us to think about the supply of people coming to us.  We're sitting here, all settled in our profession, waiting for the supply to be delivered to us.  And it takes attention away from what we could be doing. </p><p>      My students know, right?  Solution to anything lies in supply and demand, right?  There are two sides to every market, and we need to give more attention to the demand side of the market.  That's a little scary, because when we think about labor-market discrimination, we think on the supply side there're human-capital attributes and others, and on the demand side, there's animus and statistical discrimination.   </p><p>      And that indeed may be happening, but (inaudible) a lot more.  We present an environment, and the people coming to us and through us are interacting with that environment.  They're not acting in a vacuum. We have certain attitudes, beliefs, habits, culture, that we're presenting, and we need to reflect on, and perhaps improve.  </p><p>      So here's some results from the literature on why women and members of under-represented minority groups may not be becoming economists at the rate that white men are.  Each looked (inaudible), competitiveness, yada-yada-yada, role models.  Begins to think about the dynamic between the identity of the students and the environment we present.   </p><p>      But there are other ways we can examine the environment.  And so in the rest of my talk, and perhaps in the rest of the day, you will hear about some of these other factors.    </p><p>      So first, we can advance diversity by addressing implicit biases. Implicit biases happen without us knowing about it.  Implicit biases are these automatic associations that we've been trained by society, and media, and others, to make.    </p><p>      So a member from a particular group, we instantaneously associate with a particular attribute.  It's outside our conscious awareness. So whereas animus-based and statistical discrimination characterize explicit conscious choices, we're talking about another kind of action, another kind of decision that -- almost every moment.  Because every moment, we're bringing in, as the cognitive scientists estimate, 11 million bits of information, and we only have capacity to compute or deal with 40 bits.  </p><p>      So these automatic associations take over.  As you can see, this is linked to the literature now that we have been fruitfully incorporating into our work in the form of behavioral economics.    </p><p>      So psychologists and others show that most of the population is no longer explicitly biased.  At least responses to surveys will show respondents denying explicit biases, or revealing few explicit biases. But most of us are implicitly biased.  </p><p>      So just like you might associate green with go and red with stop, we have these trained impulses.  You can test yourself for your implicit associations by going to Implicit.Harvard.edu, and they have a wide variety of tests you can take.  They're kind of fun.  These are just a few of the tests available.  </p><p>      Do you make an automatic association between women and not- science, or women and science?  You can find out, along with many other tests.   </p><p>      Note that psychologists rely on responses to these tests to measure an individual's degree of implicit bias in various dimensions and associations.  But they also have other kinds of tests to measure implicit biases, where they hook subjects up to machines and measure heart rate and brain activity to identify when implicit biases or conflicts with implicit associations internalized have been identified.  </p><p>      Where do implicit biases come from?  I pulled this from January's meeting.  Now many of you may not have noticed.  I just had to make a big deal of it.  </p><p>      So this is for our great job market.  And we have two white hands shaking.  One might be a female, because there are four buttons on the suit I guess.  But the shirt doesn't look very female.  At least it's adorned as a male, that hand is.  </p><p>      So I don't know whether this reflects implicit biases, or just engenders them.  But they're everywhere.  And I want to say we are all implicitly biased.  Research has shown that women are just as likely to be implicitly biased against other women as men are.    </p><p>      So it's not about pointing fingers.  It's about examining ourselves, and identifying where we might make associations that we don't want to be making, and then taking steps to de-bias.  And there are distinct steps we can take.  </p><p>      So there is oodles of experiments demonstrating implicit biases, and how they affect decisions.  Again, I can give you the details later if you wish, but the professional decisions of physicians and police officers have been demonstrated to correlate with the implicit biases, and seem to be heavily influenced by implicit biases. Certainly, job market decisions of many types have been explored with the lens of implicit biases.  </p><p>      And there are other results, which I think future speakers today will be discussing.  So I'll move on, and just note that there are things we can do about it.  You will see more explicit interventions later, I hope.  But to give you a sense, note that economists have acknowledged the presence of implicit biases, and have thought of ways to address them.   </p><p>      So Price and Wolfers looked at NBA referees.  And because it's a snap judgment that a referee might make in the moment to decide whether to call a personal foul on a player or not, but to be generated by an implicit bias, rather than by some long, thought-out decision involving statistical or animus-based discrimination.  </p><p>      And there was a pattern of behavior, a perverse pattern of behavior, where referees were less likely to call fouls on own-race players.  This study got a lot of attention.  And the referees want to do their job.  They want to be impartial.  </p><p>      And so then the economists went back and collected more data after the publicity storm, and the bias was gone.  So that gives hope that there are things individuals can do to de-bias.  Awareness is the first step.  </p><p>      Other general strategies include time, clarity and accountability, where accountability is just the idea that after you make a decision, hold yourself accountable for it.  Explain to yourself why you made that decision.  Why did you (inaudible)?  It wasn't just a feeling.  You better have specific reasons you can tell yourself.  That makes it a less-likely bias decision if you're going to have to do that in the future.  </p><p>      And training.  As I said, there are many steps, explicit evidence-based steps you can take to de-bias.  The Bank of England is offering training on implicit bias to all of its officers.  And as of two years ago, got through a third.  And so I imagine they've completed the rounds.  </p><p>      Second, we can advance diversity by being attentive to micro- inequities; the idea that in every interaction there is potential for unfair and inefficient treatment.  It's not just at the formal gateways to our profession.  It's not just when we are deciding whom to hire or interview, or which students to accept into our programs.    </p><p>      But it's a day-to-day, moment-to-moment kind of interaction.  We might have the opportunity to stop and chat with a student in the hall, or to respond in a constructive way, or a personal way to their comment in class.    </p><p>      So recently, researchers conducted a field experiment in academia.  The subjects were over 6,000 professors working in Ph.D. programs across all disciplines in top universities.  And they got an e-mail.  Each of these professors got an e-mail from a fictitious student.    </p><p>      The student requested a meeting to occur in a week for 10 minutes to talk about the possibility of entering the program, specifically or in general.  But the only thing that varied across females was the name of the student making the request.  And the names were tested so that they were well identified with respect to their gender and race.  </p><p>      The results, I think it's pretty impressive so many people responded to this anonymous student.  But significantly, specifically significant differences in response rates, and in meeting-acceptance rates between white males and all the others.  </p><p>      So it's not just Emily and Lakisha (ph) who are getting differences in treatments, it's our students.  So a bit more detail, the lurid details of this investigation.  Disaggregating by general category of discipline, you see business programs have the biggest discriminatory gap.    </p><p>      So just so you can read the table, it indicates that 62 percent of women and minority students got a response, 25 percent more, totalling 87 percent of Caucasian males, received a response.  We are down in the social-sciences group, which includes economics, plus 18 other disciplines, psychology, sociology, urban studies, criminology, area studies, gender studies, the like. </p><p>      So I begged, but I did not get data for economists from the researchers.  So I respect that.  But in a way, it doesn't matter.  In a way, we should be attentive to micro-inequities and implicit biases, regardless of what group averages are.  </p><p>      We need to -- we have the obligation and the power to examine our own behavior and improve it.  And I'm talking to myself as much as to you.  Please don't get me wrong.    </p><p>      The researchers did find correlations.  Higher-paid professions, private universities, were more likely to -- or had bigger gaps, discriminatory gaps.  They also discovered that higher percentage females or minority disciplines had no bearing on the discriminatory gap.  </p><p>      A woman contacting a woman, or a member of a particular racial and ethnic group contacting a professor of similar group, no bearing, except for I think Chinese males did benefit from contacting a Chinese professor.  By the way, Chinese students were the most discriminated group in this group.  But all racial and gender groups experienced discrimination for the most part, except Caucasian males.  </p><p>      Next category, we can advance diversity by re-examining our rules and practices.  So sometimes you see the advice, and it's not bad advice, that recognizing the role that implicit bias plays in our behavior, the solution is to make more rules.  So there's less scope for our impulses to take over.  </p><p>      But we better be darn careful about making those rules, because rules, and practices and habits can embody discrimination, racism, sexism themselves.  So just like a facially, neutral practice like voter I.D. laws can have disparate effects on different groups.  So, too, can our explicit and implicit rules.  </p><p>      More a problem than a solution.  But then I write, \"Rules have (ph) its practices and culture, have systematically and unintentionally advantaged or disadvantaged members of particular groups.\"  </p><p>      So these are not only explicit rules, but implicit ones; rules of thumb we use.  My favorite paper on the topic is by Ian Haney Lopez from the (inaudible) Journal in 2000.  Of course, he was looking at whether the practice was legal under current statutes.    </p><p>      But he found that grand jurors in L.A. county were at the time, I think, 5 or 6 percent Hispanic, whereas, the population was over 40 percent Hispanic.  There is great disparity in who is making judgments on defendants, and who the defendants were.    </p><p>      And there was lots of testimony by the judges whose job it was to appoint grand jurors.  And they sincerely and, on the stand, said they did not intend to discriminate.  But the effect was discrimination. And it was discovered that, you know, the rule of thumb for finding grand jurors was to use social networks so you could find people who would do good jobs, and take the position responsibly.  But using that practice had the effect of creating disparity and disadvantage for members of certain groups.    </p><p>      So we need to think about, in our own lives, what habits, or rules of thumb, or written rules we use to make decisions, and whether they too can be creating, unintentionally, disparities.  </p><p>      Lastly, and this is kind of a living out, an attempt to live out recommendations from the other three points.  We can advance diversity by changing the way we present economics to students.  </p><p>      And I know not all of you are teachers here.  But I want to introduce you to my project that Janice kindly mentioned earlier. It's called, \"Diversifying Economic Quality,\" short, Div-E-Q, which is an online resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics.  It's a wiki, right?    </p><p>      So people send me ideas.  Of course, my students and I, and my colleagues, research and cover a lot of useful ideas, teaching tips to give professors and departments.  But it's also a forum where we can exchange ideas as for how to improve our interactions with students, and our students' connections to our discipline.  </p><p>      Because as you saw from the numbers, we have a problem at the undergraduate level.  And I think there's something more we can do to attract a more diverse body of students to our very excellent discipline.    </p><p>      So here are some ideas, the front page of the resource.  I don't know if you can see it from where you're sitting, but I'll just read out a couple of points.  It gives you tips for how to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classes, how you could take an implicit association test to detect any implicit associations you might be making, how to offer wise criticism.  I think a speaker later today will be talking about that, and so on.  </p><p>      So there are large and small things you can find here.  And we also present an assessment of the evidence.  Some of these strategies have been documented as being better for students.  They're evidence- based strategies, better for all students, and often particularly for students who are female or racial and ethnic minority.  Members of under-represented groups do very well when we think carefully about how to make economics relevant to their lives.  </p><p>      So here's a summary of my talk.  We're not very diverse. Increasing our diversity would enhance efficiency and equity.  And we can work on the demand side.  We can change the environment we create. It gives us something to do, right?  Not that we didn't have enough.  </p><p>      But, you know, we have the power and the obligation to do all we can to address the system -- or situation.  So those are the four points.  And now I'd like to end with a guidepost for where we can go the rest of today, and in months ahead.  </p><p>      You'll be getting more instruction and prompts throughout the day, just a way to organize productive conversation.  But to get a mindset prepared, I really would like you to identify a partner right now, and exchange e-mail addresses, and commit to following up with your partner in January to see if you've actually done anything that you're potentially committing to do today.    </p><p>      Second point, commit to do today at least one personal and one departmental initiative.  And then of course, I think you've seen on the tables or elsewhere, we have a -- or the Fed, the board has put up an e-mail address.  So (inaudible) now, or in months ahead, you can send questions or comments to the board, and we promise someone will read them and respond.  </p><p>      So I'd love to take questions.  But at this moment, find a partner and exchange contact information please.  </p><p>      (ACTIVITY)  </p><p>      I love the energy.  So I want to make two notes, organizational notes.  One is on each table there's a (inaudible) giving you the e- mail address, and a hashtag if you're a tweeting type.  I know we used to (inaudible) who's tweeting out the conference.  Others can as well.  </p><p>      I am prepared to take questions now, or in private conversation later.  Any questions pressing?  Yes?  </p><p>      All right.  So there's a question.  I'm sorry to like cut the flow of conversation.  But I promise there'll be plenty of opportunities to talk more.  I really like it.  </p><p>      So the question is about this slide.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) So the first groups are more innovative and they're more successful, and solving problems.  However, what research also shows is that these groups don't notice this themselves.  So actually, when you ask more diverse groups in the lab after they have made these better performance, they think that they performed worse.    </p><p>      And why do they think that they performed worse?  They think so because they had a sort of unpleasant experience.  There was more disagreement in the groups.  There was more discussion.  It took longer to reach this better decision.  It took them longer.  And it involved more energy from their side.    </p><p>      And that is something I think we need to think a lot about.  How can we make -- how can we make people like diversity?  How can we make ourselves like diversity?  How can we step out of that comfort zone? And I think it's, just as an important point to make here, as not only concluding that more diverse groups are more innovative and make better solutions, reach better solutions, but also that they don't notice.  How can we make them notice?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Great.  Thank you.  Any other questions or comments? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Sure.  I'll post them.  I think Janice said the board would be hosting -- OK.  We'll work on it.  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) One of the things I do is I have students on their exams put their student I.D. numbers, not their names.  A lot of people have probably tried that.  I believe it works.  But I've read a little about, heard a little about letters of recommendation bias.    </p><p>      And one of the things my colleague from the psyche department taught me to do is to have a checklist for specific jobs.  I always have a checklist of skills, regardless of the applicant's skills, that would be valuable to the employer, and make sure I go down the checklist.  Because the data shows that faculty describe women much differently than they describe men.  </p><p>      So just basic rules like that that are neutral can be quick to do, and make job easier.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) It's important to have a separation of minority females from Caucasian females.  So all your information provided was on females.  Did you -- or did the people who did these different studies and research, did they separate it out to see if there is -- still a bias even more so that impacts minority females versus non?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So in reality, these intersections are really important. And the experiences of white women on average are different than for women in other racial and ethnic groups.    </p><p>      So some of the studies I showed only did the gender dimension. Some did only racial or ethnic dimension.  The one study on professors' response had enough observations that they could disaggregate by race and gender.  That's a numbers problem that a lot of research has.  So we have to kind of extrapolate what we learn by studying some dimensions of difference to what possibly might be going on in others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I'm Donna Ginter (ph).  I've done some work on women of color, science.  And what we found is that the sort of binding constraint is more race than gender.  And so if you have gender parity -- if you look at life science, 50 percent, or over 50 percent of Ph.D.s or in life sciences go to women.  </p><p>      But if you look at women of color in life science, the race dimension that affects their success relative to the gender.  And a colleague of mine calls this \"distance from privilege,\" in that white women are much closer to privilege, which we view as white men, compared with women of color.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I just wondered if you also have available to distribute a breakdown of the initial statistics you gave, that also show family income or resources in addition to race and gender, just to see what the breakdown is there as well?  Because one of the barriers may also, in addition to race and gender, may have to do with income.  And I'd just be curious to see how important that is.  And it may not break any which way, but it'd be fun to see. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Right.  So in that way, gender is a controlled experiment, because generally, the income backgrounds are the same across genders.  Those particular data don't have the information associated with them.  But I think there are studies.  I could look them up for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I was just wondering -- I wish I knew.  I was just wondering if anyone here knows essentially when these college majors are chosen?  Sam and I were discussing it.  Your statistics suggest that the problem exists already in college, so well before even graduate school, or things like that.  And where are good times to intervene to assist, you know, in getting a more diverse group of students into economics?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So I know of interventions -- microphone's being passed. I know of interventions that start as early as high school.  I think Jane Katz (ph) is in the room who does math.    </p><p>      The board does math by econ.  Is that how we say that out loud? And so the board has a program here, and in various reserve banks you might know about, to try to get I think under-represented groups more excited and knowledgeable about econ earlier.  </p><p>      Most of the interventions -- we hear about some awesome interventions today.  And most of them do take place I believe at later stages of the pipeline.  There's the -- well, I think we'll hear about the summer program, which is for college students, and then the Div-E-Q that I do is at that level.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I have a paper coming out any day now about women in academic science careers.  And we were looking specifically at mathematically-intensive fields, including economics.  So we separated economics out from the rest of the social sciences.    </p><p>      We have a figure in our paper that shows the number of Ph.D. students, percentage of Ph.D. students, female, and the average GOE (ph) quantitative score, and it's a downward sloping line.  So you have economics, engineering and math, you know, the percentages of females are low, and the (inaudible) scores to get into graduate school are high.  </p><p>      And one of the recommendations from our paper is it's math, and it's math that starts early, middle school and high school, because by the time they get to college, they may not even be able to take those college courses necessary to be successful in these mathematically- intensive fields.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Yes?  We'll make this the last question.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Just in relation to the question, so there's a recent -- it was like the previous issue of the SEJ (ph) has an article examining the role model type (inaudible) mainly.  But they have a nice identification strategy, where they use visiting professors who are not -- or new professors that are not assigned when the students register, just to see whether gender matters. </p><p>      And so it doesn't seem that it matters then, which -- and it kind of suggests that it starts before the major declaration, and before college.  So it's kind of disheartening to read that paper because of that, right?  So maybe by the time that they get there, we're too late.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Well, I know of a paper that uses the random assignment of students to professors at West Point, I think Paige Carroll (ph), another author, looked at that and saw that while male students weren't affected by the gender, the professor -- female students definitely were, and majored in science, STEM fields, maybe even econ as a result of that early exposure to a role model.  </p><p>      So there are things in the profession we can do.  I'm -- I think we have so much more to learn.  And with random assignment experiments producing so much information on the nature of the barriers, and the implicit bias, and whatnot, that exists in our environment, that we can really make progress, both in our research as economists, but also in our actions and procedures as economists.  </p><p>      I said that was the last question.  I see another hand, OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) And this starts in the seventh grade.  So I was teaching seventh-graders.  So I noticed that the women in my class -- this was in Oakland, California.  This isn't (ph) when I was in Berkeley.  And it seems the women in my class were suffering in the same way.  The girls in the class are suffering in the same way.  </p><p>      So I think it starts about that time.  There were definite roles that were assigned to boys and girls before I got there.  And they -- I'm not saying that I'm the intervention, but just to be clear.  But it was a summer program, and you didn't see these dramatic differences in women and girls speaking up and participating in problem-solving, and in public problem-solving.  So I think that it's much earlier than high school.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  But there are steps we can take then to counter those forces that may be present before we see our students.  All right. Thank you so much.  We have a 15-minute break.  At 10:30 our next speaker will begin.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DGM-DR31-JDPT-T062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Thank you, Janice, for the kind introduction. It's been a joy to work with you over the last 10 months.  And thank you, Chair Yellen, for your insightful remarks, and your inspiring presence in our profession.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      It's an honor to work with all of you today in this room.  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come together and think about the very important issue before us; diversity in the economics profession.</p><p>      I know and respect the work that many of you have done, and I am excited to map out a plan of action with you.  The board, and in particular, Deputy Director Janice Shack-Marquez, and Director David Wilcox, have shown remarkable leadership in bringing us together today to open a profession-wide dialogue about diversity.</p><p>      The commitment displayed by all the officers I've met with here is invigorating and powerful.  In this room we have these esteemed board staff, Federal Reserve Bank presidents and research directors, chairs of top economics departments from around the country, economists who have made significant contributions to understanding and addressing diversity, and leading scholars from other disciplines.</p><p>      We have the opportunity today to put our diverse heads together and produce lasting change in our profession.  Echoing the chair's remarks, our objective is to create a profession that recruits and promotes the individuals best able to bring the energy, fresh insights and renewals, that our discipline needs to be healthy and thrive.  </p><p>      Over the course of the day, we will hear from a dream team of speakers and panelists who will share their research and their work on the ground.  I am truly excited to attend this conference.  They will expose us to examples of successful diversity initiatives in economics and around academia.  </p><p>      The presentations will help us understand the impediments to diversity and will, importantly, introduce us to evidence-based interventions we can support.  Listen with the goal of developing a list of actions and initiatives that you believe hold promise as being practicable and effective.</p><p>      In the afternoon, we will have opportunities to share and refine our ideas through group discussions.  By the end of the day, each of us should be able to identify several initiatives, large or small, which excite us.  </p><p>      To make it concrete, set a personal goal of writing down two specific actions, one each of the personal and departmental levels, that you are willing to adopt to help our profession attract and develop the best people and best ideas.  In my talk this morning, I will provide background information and a framework to organize and develop knowledge through the rest of the day.  </p><p>      All right.  So now I get to be a teacher rather than a speaker, much more practice at speaking.  I want this to be an academic conference.  I want us to converse.  If you want to ask me questions during the presentation, feel free afterwards or in conversation later.</p><p>      All right.  So my presentation has three parts.  First, I present data on diversity in the profession.  And in the next section, I briefly discuss possible consequences of having a more or less diverse profession.  </p><p>      In the last section, I lay the groundwork for our plan of attack. I offer an economist's take on the diversity literature produced in a wide variety of fields, highlighting strands of diversity research that may be less familiar, and connecting them to the logic and research that we economists have done.</p><p>      First, a note on the meaning of the term \"diversity.\"  While certainly other kinds of diversity are important and productive, our focus today is on groups that have been historically under-represented in our profession and in our country; women, African-Americans and Hispanics.</p><p>      The inclusion of people and perspectives from these groups is essential to the vitality of our profession and policymaking.  But as we learn about the barriers faced by members of these groups, we develop general knowledge that is transferrable, facilitating the inclusion of the best people and the best ideas from all groups.</p><p>      Can you hear me if I step away from the mike?  Good, all right. How are we doing?  What are our numbers?  Well, big tech firms have a reputation of being boys clubs.  Yahoo -- all right, let's skip Yahoo for a moment.  Google, Twitter, Apple, 70 percent of their workforces are male.</p><p>      What do you think our profession looks like?  What percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors at colleges and universities in this country are female?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      Someone studied before the test.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      BAYER:  True, true.  All right.  So there are my numbers, my cute graphic.  All right.  So calculated maybe slightly differently.  But 22 percent in the most recent academic year are of tenured and tenure- track faculty are women.  </p><p>      What about racial and ethnic minority, black or Hispanic economists?  What percentage do you think that is?  Ten?  Oh, less than 10?  Do I hear any others?  Five.</p><p>      These numbers, by the way, are from the UAQ (ph).  Some of you fill that out every year, some of you don't.  So we do have a problem with response rate, missing data.  But the numbers I calculate there are fairly consistent year to year, and across other surveys as well. So this is an accurate impression (inaudible) an accurate number.</p><p>      So maybe it's a legacy effect.  Maybe over time we'll diversify a bit more.  So let's get a sense of what the younger cohorts are showing.  </p><p>      Looking at new Ph.D.s over the last three years, 33 percent are female.  It's a pretty low number.  And it does not compare well to other disciplines.  What's happening in other fields is they're represented political science, 48 percent.  Then (ph) Ph.D.s, 50 percent female.</p><p>      Generally, folks are surprised.  Racially, we see a similar pattern.  For new Ph.D.s, 8 percent of new Ph.D.s -- this is looking at U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- are black or Hispanic.  If we include temporary residents, the total drops to 3 percent.  </p><p>      In the other disciplines, 17 and 12 respectively across the political science and the STEM fields.  \"STEM\" means science, technology, engineering and math.  </p><p>      I'm sorry?</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      BAYER:  Oh, sure, sure, sure.  So if the numbers here -- 8 percent, 17 percent, 12 percent -- exclude new Ph.D.s by temporary residents, if we include those Ph.D. recipients, the numbers drop to 3 percent, 13 percent, and 8 percent.  So we do have a high participation rate in our discipline of temporary residents in Ph.D. programs.</p><p>      So maybe even younger cohorts will save us.  All right.  So let's move back a stage in the pipeline and look at undergraduate students. Any guesses?  </p><p>      Better.  All right.  So what do you think the number is for econ majors who are female?  What percentage?  Thirty to 40, yes.  How do you think that compares to the other disciplines?  Poorly?  In a word, yes.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      BAYER:  So depending on how inclusive we are when we consider what a STEM major is changes the numbers slightly, but not very much at all.  So it is true physics, and slightly less diverse than we are in these dimensions, but not a whole lot less.  </p><p>      And math, for instance, I think 48 percent of math majors are female.  So we're behind.  We're doing poorly.  All right.  Here, black and Hispanic econ majors constitute 12 percent; political science, 24; STEM, 20 percent.</p><p>      OK.  Well, maybe this is not great, but getting better.  No. Over the last 50 years almost, we see the proportion of econ majors who are female.  We experienced a sharp increase in the '70s, but since have plateaued.        There's really no reason to believe change will occur without distinct, intentional action on our parts.  We see a similar message when we look at racial and ethnic diversity amongst undergraduate students.  Economics is behind -- behind all majors, and specifically here, behind political science and STEM majors.  And there's little upward trend.</p><p>      Convinced that it was worth the trip today?  So far, so good, or so bad?  So we have a problem.  Does it matter?  Yes, problems matter. </p><p>      We see data.  Do they matter?  What are the possible consequences of the numbers that we've seen, the lack of diversity in our discipline?  Who are they?  Who are these people?</p><p>      Nobeloriates (ph) in economics, 75 of them over the last 46 years.  So what are some possible consequences?  Just hypothesize, speculate.  What are some possible consequences of (inaudible) economists?</p><p>      Not being as diverse as the rest of the population.  Sure. Anybody?  You don't see yourself there.  What effect does that have on students?</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      BAYER:  Eloquently said, and captures I think all three of these dimensions of consequence, or maybe six dimensions, right?  The consequences of the lack of diversity in our profession are both inequity and inefficiency.  </p><p>      It's not just about being nice to certain people, to include them in our fun work.  But it's about getting efficient allocations through the people who join our profession in creating the body of knowledge we are responsible for expanding, and in making government policy.</p><p>      So around the academy, within economics and outside, researchers have been looking at the consequences of not diversifying groups.  The consequences of homogeneity.  And the research takes two strands.  </p><p>      Well, of course we want to pull from 100 percent of the talent pool.  That's a given.  But it has consequences even beyond that issue.  And I've kind of given you a couple representative papers within each strand.</p><p>      The first strand says diversity brings a greater range of insights and perspectives.  If we have a broader group of people, we have a broader set of ideas.  </p><p>      The second strand says there's something special about mixed groups.  It changes group dynamics.  The behavior of individuals is different depending on the composition of the group in which they're (inaudible).</p><p>      And yes, there are challenges to being a mixed group; in communication, maybe in trust.  But there are also distinct benefits proved by laboratory research and on the ground.  Some of the research has problems with looking for causation.  But others very distinctly show that mixed groups are more successful in solving problems, especially complex problems, in part because the participants work harder, spend longer, prepare more, than in homogeneous groups.  </p><p>      So I'd be happy to answer questions about any of these papers later.  But at this point I'm trying to give a high-level overview and let you know that details exist.  </p><p>      I want to show you details from one paper.  You may know it. May, McGarvey and Weibels (ph) recently surveyed all AEA members with Ph.D.s working in the U.S., Ph.D.s from U.S. economic departments. Pretty similar group, except they disaggregated survey responses by gender.</p><p>      I've chosen four items.  There were many, many items, most of which had distinct, statistically-significant differences in responses.  Along the bottom, I showed statements.  And the respondents were free to respond on a scale from one to five whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement.</p><p>      So for instance, you can see that women were 21 percentage points more likely to disagree with the statement that the U.S. has an excessive amount of government regulation of economic activity.  Even more striking, my daughter said this is the only statistic I had to show all day.</p><p>      With the statement, \"Job opportunities for men and women in the U.S. are approximately equal,\" 58 percent of female economists disagreed with that statement, 16 percent of male economists...</p><p>      In questions about economic principles and theory, there was similarity amongst respondents, but disagreement on interpretation of economic outcomes, and on recommendations for policy work different, even after controlling these numbers, control for vintage of degree, place of employment, and so on.</p><p>      So we have a problem, that's the bad news.  The good new is there's something we can do about it.  What can we do?  Well, we can patch the pipeline, or try.  So this is a familiar analogy to those working not only in economics, but in many other disciplines, for thinking about what happens to people on their way to us.  </p><p>      And they might start in high school or college, and move forward, and perhaps take a Ph.D. program, and perhaps complete it, and then perhaps go into the academy, and perhaps (inaudible) tenure-track job, and perhaps get tenure, and ultimately promotion.  And there's been a lot of excellent research on that process, understanding why perhaps women and minorities leak out at higher rates than do others.</p><p>      There's been a lot of excellent work on initiatives designed to address those identified problems.  But I think the framing of the issue as a pipeline causes us to think about the supply of people coming to us.  We're sitting here, all settled in our profession, waiting for the supply to be delivered to us.  And it takes attention away from what we could be doing.      My students know, right?  Solution to anything lies in supply and demand, right?  There are two sides to every market, and we need to give more attention to the demand side of the market.  That's a little scary, because when we think about labor-market discrimination, we think on the supply side there're human-capital attributes and others, and on the demand side, there's animus and statistical discrimination. </p><p>      And that indeed may be happening, but (inaudible) a lot more.  We present an environment, and the people coming to us and through us are interacting with that environment.  They're not acting in a vacuum. We have certain attitudes, beliefs, habits, culture, that we're presenting, and we need to reflect on, and perhaps improve.</p><p>      So here's some results from the literature on why women and members of under-represented minority groups may not be becoming economists at the rate that white men are.  Each looked (inaudible), competitiveness, yada-yada-yada, role models.  Begins to think about the dynamic between the identity of the students and the environment we present. </p><p>      But there are other ways we can examine the environment.  And so in the rest of my talk, and perhaps in the rest of the day, you will hear about some of these other factors.  </p><p>      So first, we can advance diversity by addressing implicit biases. Implicit biases happen without us knowing about it.  Implicit biases are these automatic associations that we've been trained by society, and media, and others, to make.  </p><p>      So a member from a particular group, we instantaneously associate with a particular attribute.  It's outside our conscious awareness. So whereas animus-based and statistical discrimination characterize explicit conscious choices, we're talking about another kind of action, another kind of decision that -- almost every moment.  Because every moment, we're bringing in, as the cognitive scientists estimate, 11 million bits of information, and we only have capacity to compute or deal with 40 bits.</p><p>      So these automatic associations take over.  As you can see, this is linked to the literature now that we have been fruitfully incorporating into our work in the form of behavioral economics.  </p><p>      So psychologists and others show that most of the population is no longer explicitly biased.  At least responses to surveys will show respondents denying explicit biases, or revealing few explicit biases. But most of us are implicitly biased.</p><p>      So just like you might associate green with go and red with stop, we have these trained impulses.  You can test yourself for your implicit associations by going to Implicit.Harvard.edu, and they have a wide variety of tests you can take.  They're kind of fun.  These are just a few of the tests available.</p><p>      Do you make an automatic association between women and not- science, or women and science?  You can find out, along with many other tests.        Note that psychologists rely on responses to these tests to measure an individual's degree of implicit bias in various dimensions and associations.  But they also have other kinds of tests to measure implicit biases, where they hook subjects up to machines and measure heart rate and brain activity to identify when implicit biases or conflicts with implicit associations internalized have been identified.</p><p>      Where do implicit biases come from?  I pulled this from January's meeting.  Now many of you may not have noticed.  I just had to make a big deal of it.</p><p>      So this is for our great job market.  And we have two white hands shaking.  One might be a female, because there are four buttons on the suit I guess.  But the shirt doesn't look very female.  At least it's adorned as a male, that hand is.</p><p>      So I don't know whether this reflects implicit biases, or just engenders them.  But they're everywhere.  And I want to say we are all implicitly biased.  Research has shown that women are just as likely to be implicitly biased against other women as men are.  </p><p>      So it's not about pointing fingers.  It's about examining ourselves, and identifying where we might make associations that we don't want to be making, and then taking steps to de-bias.  And there are distinct steps we can take.</p><p>      So there is oodles of experiments demonstrating implicit biases, and how they affect decisions.  Again, I can give you the details later if you wish, but the professional decisions of physicians and police officers have been demonstrated to correlate with the implicit biases, and seem to be heavily influenced by implicit biases. Certainly, job market decisions of many types have been explored with the lens of implicit biases.</p><p>      And there are other results, which I think future speakers today will be discussing.  So I'll move on, and just note that there are things we can do about it.  You will see more explicit interventions later, I hope.  But to give you a sense, note that economists have acknowledged the presence of implicit biases, and have thought of ways to address them. </p><p>      So Price and Wolfers looked at NBA referees.  And because it's a snap judgment that a referee might make in the moment to decide whether to call a personal foul on a player or not, but to be generated by an implicit bias, rather than by some long, thought-out decision involving statistical or animus-based discrimination.</p><p>      And there was a pattern of behavior, a perverse pattern of behavior, where referees were less likely to call fouls on own-race players.  This study got a lot of attention.  And the referees want to do their job.  They want to be impartial.</p><p>      And so then the economists went back and collected more data after the publicity storm, and the bias was gone.  So that gives hope that there are things individuals can do to de-bias.  Awareness is the first step.</p><p>      Other general strategies include time, clarity and accountability, where accountability is just the idea that after you make a decision, hold yourself accountable for it.  Explain to yourself why you made that decision.  Why did you (inaudible)?  It wasn't just a feeling.  You better have specific reasons you can tell yourself.  That makes it a less-likely bias decision if you're going to have to do that in the future.</p><p>      And training.  As I said, there are many steps, explicit evidence-based steps you can take to de-bias.  The Bank of England is offering training on implicit bias to all of its officers.  And as of two years ago, got through a third.  And so I imagine they've completed the rounds.</p><p>      Second, we can advance diversity by being attentive to micro- inequities; the idea that in every interaction there is potential for unfair and inefficient treatment.  It's not just at the formal gateways to our profession.  It's not just when we are deciding whom to hire or interview, or which students to accept into our programs.  </p><p>      But it's a day-to-day, moment-to-moment kind of interaction.  We might have the opportunity to stop and chat with a student in the hall, or to respond in a constructive way, or a personal way to their comment in class.  </p><p>      So recently, researchers conducted a field experiment in academia.  The subjects were over 6,000 professors working in Ph.D. programs across all disciplines in top universities.  And they got an e-mail.  Each of these professors got an e-mail from a fictitious student.  </p><p>      The student requested a meeting to occur in a week for 10 minutes to talk about the possibility of entering the program, specifically or in general.  But the only thing that varied across females was the name of the student making the request.  And the names were tested so that they were well identified with respect to their gender and race.</p><p>      The results, I think it's pretty impressive so many people responded to this anonymous student.  But significantly, specifically significant differences in response rates, and in meeting-acceptance rates between white males and all the others.</p><p>      So it's not just Emily and Lakisha (ph) who are getting differences in treatments, it's our students.  So a bit more detail, the lurid details of this investigation.  Disaggregating by general category of discipline, you see business programs have the biggest discriminatory gap.  </p><p>      So just so you can read the table, it indicates that 62 percent of women and minority students got a response, 25 percent more, totalling 87 percent of Caucasian males, received a response.  We are down in the social-sciences group, which includes economics, plus 18 other disciplines, psychology, sociology, urban studies, criminology, area studies, gender studies, the like.      So I begged, but I did not get data for economists from the researchers.  So I respect that.  But in a way, it doesn't matter.  In a way, we should be attentive to micro-inequities and implicit biases, regardless of what group averages are.</p><p>      We need to -- we have the obligation and the power to examine our own behavior and improve it.  And I'm talking to myself as much as to you.  Please don't get me wrong.  </p><p>      The researchers did find correlations.  Higher-paid professions, private universities, were more likely to -- or had bigger gaps, discriminatory gaps.  They also discovered that higher percentage females or minority disciplines had no bearing on the discriminatory gap.</p><p>      A woman contacting a woman, or a member of a particular racial and ethnic group contacting a professor of similar group, no bearing, except for I think Chinese males did benefit from contacting a Chinese professor.  By the way, Chinese students were the most discriminated group in this group.  But all racial and gender groups experienced discrimination for the most part, except Caucasian males.</p><p>      Next category, we can advance diversity by re-examining our rules and practices.  So sometimes you see the advice, and it's not bad advice, that recognizing the role that implicit bias plays in our behavior, the solution is to make more rules.  So there's less scope for our impulses to take over.</p><p>      But we better be darn careful about making those rules, because rules, and practices and habits can embody discrimination, racism, sexism themselves.  So just like a facially, neutral practice like voter I.D. laws can have disparate effects on different groups.  So, too, can our explicit and implicit rules.</p><p>      More a problem than a solution.  But then I write, \"Rules have (ph) its practices and culture, have systematically and unintentionally advantaged or disadvantaged members of particular groups.\"</p><p>      So these are not only explicit rules, but implicit ones; rules of thumb we use.  My favorite paper on the topic is by Ian Haney Lopez from the (inaudible) Journal in 2000.  Of course, he was looking at whether the practice was legal under current statutes.  </p><p>      But he found that grand jurors in L.A. county were at the time, I think, 5 or 6 percent Hispanic, whereas, the population was over 40 percent Hispanic.  There is great disparity in who is making judgments on defendants, and who the defendants were.  </p><p>      And there was lots of testimony by the judges whose job it was to appoint grand jurors.  And they sincerely and, on the stand, said they did not intend to discriminate.  But the effect was discrimination. And it was discovered that, you know, the rule of thumb for finding grand jurors was to use social networks so you could find people who would do good jobs, and take the position responsibly.  But using that practice had the effect of creating disparity and disadvantage for members of certain groups.  </p><p>      So we need to think about, in our own lives, what habits, or rules of thumb, or written rules we use to make decisions, and whether they too can be creating, unintentionally, disparities.</p><p>      Lastly, and this is kind of a living out, an attempt to live out recommendations from the other three points.  We can advance diversity by changing the way we present economics to students.</p><p>      And I know not all of you are teachers here.  But I want to introduce you to my project that Janice kindly mentioned earlier. It's called, \"Diversifying Economic Quality,\" short, Div-E-Q, which is an online resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics.  It's a wiki, right?  </p><p>      So people send me ideas.  Of course, my students and I, and my colleagues, research and cover a lot of useful ideas, teaching tips to give professors and departments.  But it's also a forum where we can exchange ideas as for how to improve our interactions with students, and our students' connections to our discipline.</p><p>      Because as you saw from the numbers, we have a problem at the undergraduate level.  And I think there's something more we can do to attract a more diverse body of students to our very excellent discipline.  </p><p>      So here are some ideas, the front page of the resource.  I don't know if you can see it from where you're sitting, but I'll just read out a couple of points.  It gives you tips for how to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classes, how you could take an implicit association test to detect any implicit associations you might be making, how to offer wise criticism.  I think a speaker later today will be talking about that, and so on.</p><p>      So there are large and small things you can find here.  And we also present an assessment of the evidence.  Some of these strategies have been documented as being better for students.  They're evidence- based strategies, better for all students, and often particularly for students who are female or racial and ethnic minority.  Members of under-represented groups do very well when we think carefully about how to make economics relevant to their lives.</p><p>      So here's a summary of my talk.  We're not very diverse. Increasing our diversity would enhance efficiency and equity.  And we can work on the demand side.  We can change the environment we create. It gives us something to do, right?  Not that we didn't have enough.</p><p>      But, you know, we have the power and the obligation to do all we can to address the system -- or situation.  So those are the four points.  And now I'd like to end with a guidepost for where we can go the rest of today, and in months ahead.</p><p>      You'll be getting more instruction and prompts throughout the day, just a way to organize productive conversation.  But to get a mindset prepared, I really would like you to identify a partner right now, and exchange e-mail addresses, and commit to following up with your partner in January to see if you've actually done anything that you're potentially committing to do today.  </p><p>      Second point, commit to do today at least one personal and one departmental initiative.  And then of course, I think you've seen on the tables or elsewhere, we have a -- or the Fed, the board has put up an e-mail address.  So (inaudible) now, or in months ahead, you can send questions or comments to the board, and we promise someone will read them and respond.</p><p>      So I'd love to take questions.  But at this moment, find a partner and exchange contact information please.</p><p>      (ACTIVITY)</p><p>      I love the energy.  So I want to make two notes, organizational notes.  One is on each table there's a (inaudible) giving you the e- mail address, and a hashtag if you're a tweeting type.  I know we used to (inaudible) who's tweeting out the conference.  Others can as well.</p><p>      I am prepared to take questions now, or in private conversation later.  Any questions pressing?  Yes?</p><p>      All right.  So there's a question.  I'm sorry to like cut the flow of conversation.  But I promise there'll be plenty of opportunities to talk more.  I really like it.</p><p>      So the question is about this slide.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) So the first groups are more innovative and they're more successful, and solving problems.  However, what research also shows is that these groups don't notice this themselves.  So actually, when you ask more diverse groups in the lab after they have made these better performance, they think that they performed worse.  </p><p>      And why do they think that they performed worse?  They think so because they had a sort of unpleasant experience.  There was more disagreement in the groups.  There was more discussion.  It took longer to reach this better decision.  It took them longer.  And it involved more energy from their side.  </p><p>      And that is something I think we need to think a lot about.  How can we make -- how can we make people like diversity?  How can we make ourselves like diversity?  How can we step out of that comfort zone? And I think it's, just as an important point to make here, as not only concluding that more diverse groups are more innovative and make better solutions, reach better solutions, but also that they don't notice.  How can we make them notice?  </p><p>      BAYER:  Great.  Thank you.  Any other questions or comments? Yes.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      BAYER:  Sure.  I'll post them.  I think Janice said the board would be hosting -- OK.  We'll work on it.  OK.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) One of the things I do is I have students on their exams put their student I.D. numbers, not their names.  A lot of people have probably tried that.  I believe it works.  But I've read a little about, heard a little about letters of recommendation bias.  </p><p>      And one of the things my colleague from the psyche department taught me to do is to have a checklist for specific jobs.  I always have a checklist of skills, regardless of the applicant's skills, that would be valuable to the employer, and make sure I go down the checklist.  Because the data shows that faculty describe women much differently than they describe men.</p><p>      So just basic rules like that that are neutral can be quick to do, and make job easier.  </p><p>      BAYER:  Great.  Thank you.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) It's important to have a separation of minority females from Caucasian females.  So all your information provided was on females.  Did you -- or did the people who did these different studies and research, did they separate it out to see if there is -- still a bias even more so that impacts minority females versus non?</p><p>      BAYER:  So in reality, these intersections are really important. And the experiences of white women on average are different than for women in other racial and ethnic groups.  </p><p>      So some of the studies I showed only did the gender dimension. Some did only racial or ethnic dimension.  The one study on professors' response had enough observations that they could disaggregate by race and gender.  That's a numbers problem that a lot of research has.  So we have to kind of extrapolate what we learn by studying some dimensions of difference to what possibly might be going on in others.</p><p>      QUESTION:  I'm Donna Ginter (ph).  I've done some work on women of color, science.  And what we found is that the sort of binding constraint is more race than gender.  And so if you have gender parity -- if you look at life science, 50 percent, or over 50 percent of Ph.D.s or in life sciences go to women.</p><p>      But if you look at women of color in life science, the race dimension that affects their success relative to the gender.  And a colleague of mine calls this \"distance from privilege,\" in that white women are much closer to privilege, which we view as white men, compared with women of color.</p><p>      BAYER:  Thank you.</p><p>      QUESTION:  I just wondered if you also have available to distribute a breakdown of the initial statistics you gave, that also show family income or resources in addition to race and gender, just to see what the breakdown is there as well?  Because one of the barriers may also, in addition to race and gender, may have to do with income.  And I'd just be curious to see how important that is.  And it may not break any which way, but it'd be fun to see.      BAYER:  Right.  So in that way, gender is a controlled experiment, because generally, the income backgrounds are the same across genders.  Those particular data don't have the information associated with them.  But I think there are studies.  I could look them up for you.</p><p>      QUESTION:  I was just wondering -- I wish I knew.  I was just wondering if anyone here knows essentially when these college majors are chosen?  Sam and I were discussing it.  Your statistics suggest that the problem exists already in college, so well before even graduate school, or things like that.  And where are good times to intervene to assist, you know, in getting a more diverse group of students into economics?</p><p>      BAYER:  So I know of interventions -- microphone's being passed. I know of interventions that start as early as high school.  I think Jane Katz (ph) is in the room who does math.  </p><p>      The board does math by econ.  Is that how we say that out loud? And so the board has a program here, and in various reserve banks you might know about, to try to get I think under-represented groups more excited and knowledgeable about econ earlier.</p><p>      Most of the interventions -- we hear about some awesome interventions today.  And most of them do take place I believe at later stages of the pipeline.  There's the -- well, I think we'll hear about the summer program, which is for college students, and then the Div-E-Q that I do is at that level.</p><p>      QUESTION:  I have a paper coming out any day now about women in academic science careers.  And we were looking specifically at mathematically-intensive fields, including economics.  So we separated economics out from the rest of the social sciences.  </p><p>      We have a figure in our paper that shows the number of Ph.D. students, percentage of Ph.D. students, female, and the average GOE (ph) quantitative score, and it's a downward sloping line.  So you have economics, engineering and math, you know, the percentages of females are low, and the (inaudible) scores to get into graduate school are high.</p><p>      And one of the recommendations from our paper is it's math, and it's math that starts early, middle school and high school, because by the time they get to college, they may not even be able to take those college courses necessary to be successful in these mathematically- intensive fields.</p><p>      BAYER:  Yes?  We'll make this the last question.  Thank you.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Just in relation to the question, so there's a recent -- it was like the previous issue of the SEJ (ph) has an article examining the role model type (inaudible) mainly.  But they have a nice identification strategy, where they use visiting professors who are not -- or new professors that are not assigned when the students register, just to see whether gender matters.      And so it doesn't seem that it matters then, which -- and it kind of suggests that it starts before the major declaration, and before college.  So it's kind of disheartening to read that paper because of that, right?  So maybe by the time that they get there, we're too late.</p><p>      BAYER:  Well, I know of a paper that uses the random assignment of students to professors at West Point, I think Paige Carroll (ph), another author, looked at that and saw that while male students weren't affected by the gender, the professor -- female students definitely were, and majored in science, STEM fields, maybe even econ as a result of that early exposure to a role model.</p><p>      So there are things in the profession we can do.  I'm -- I think we have so much more to learn.  And with random assignment experiments producing so much information on the nature of the barriers, and the implicit bias, and whatnot, that exists in our environment, that we can really make progress, both in our research as economists, but also in our actions and procedures as economists.</p><p>      I said that was the last question.  I see another hand, OK.</p><p>      QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) And this starts in the seventh grade.  So I was teaching seventh-graders.  So I noticed that the women in my class -- this was in Oakland, California.  This isn't (ph) when I was in Berkeley.  And it seems the women in my class were suffering in the same way.  The girls in the class are suffering in the same way.</p><p>      So I think it starts about that time.  There were definite roles that were assigned to boys and girls before I got there.  And they -- I'm not saying that I'm the intervention, but just to be clear.  But it was a summer program, and you didn't see these dramatic differences in women and girls speaking up and participating in problem-solving, and in public problem-solving.  So I think that it's much earlier than high school. </p><p>      BAYER:  But there are steps we can take then to counter those forces that may be present before we see our students.  All right. Thank you so much.  We have a 15-minute break.  At 10:30 our next speaker will begin.</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-1618219039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KRW-K0W1-DY0W-41V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 30, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Undefined</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Swarthmore College</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Reserve Board</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 611310</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921130</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Initiative &amp; Referendum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001860</classCode><className>WORKPLACE DIVERSITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Thank you, Janice, for the kind introduction. It's been a joy to work with you over the last 10 months. And thank you, Chair Yellen, for your insightful remarks, and your inspiring presence in our profession.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an honor to work with all of you today in this room. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come together and think about the very important issue before us; diversity in the economics profession.</p><p>I know and respect the work that many of you have done, and I am excited to map out a plan of action with you. The board, and in particular, Deputy Director Janice Shack-Marquez, and Director David Wilcox, have shown remarkable leadership in bringing us together today to open a profession-wide dialogue about diversity.</p><p>The commitment displayed by all the officers I've met with here is invigorating and powerful. In this room we have these esteemed board staff, Federal Reserve Bank presidents and research directors, chairs of top economics departments from around the country, economists who have made significant contributions to understanding and addressing diversity, and leading scholars from other disciplines.</p><p>We have the opportunity today to put our diverse heads together and produce lasting change in our profession. Echoing the chair's remarks, our objective is to create a profession that recruits and promotes the individuals best able to bring the energy, fresh insights and renewals, that our discipline needs to be healthy and thrive.</p><p>Over the course of the day, we will hear from a dream team of speakers and panelists who will share their research and their work on the ground. I am truly excited to attend this conference. They will expose us to examples of successful diversity initiatives in economics and around academia.</p><p>The presentations will help us understand the impediments to diversity and will, importantly, introduce us to evidence-based interventions we can support. Listen with the goal of developing a list of actions and initiatives that you believe hold promise as being practicable and effective.</p><p>In the afternoon, we will have opportunities to share and refine our ideas through group discussions. By the end of the day, each of us should be able to identify several initiatives, large or small, which excite us.</p><p>To make it concrete, set a personal goal of writing down two specific actions, one each of the personal and departmental levels, that you are willing to adopt to help our profession attract and develop the best people and best ideas. In my talk this morning, I will provide background information and a framework to organize and develop knowledge through the rest of the day.</p><p>All right. So now I get to be a teacher rather than a speaker, much more practice at speaking. I want this to be an academic conference. I want us to converse. If you want to ask me questions during the presentation, feel free afterwards or in conversation later.</p><p>All right. So my presentation has three parts. First, I present data on diversity in the profession. And in the next section, I briefly discuss possible consequences of having a more or less diverse profession.</p><p>In the last section, I lay the groundwork for our plan of attack. I offer an economist's take on the diversity literature produced in a wide variety of fields, highlighting strands of diversity research that may be less familiar, and connecting them to the logic and research that we economists have done.</p><p>First, a note on the meaning of the term \"diversity.\" While certainly other kinds of diversity are important and productive, our focus today is on groups that have been historically under-represented in our profession and in our country; women, African-Americans and Hispanics.</p><p>The inclusion of people and perspectives from these groups is essential to the vitality of our profession and policymaking. But as we learn about the barriers faced by members of these groups, we develop general knowledge that is transferrable, facilitating the inclusion of the best people and the best ideas from all groups.</p><p>Can you hear me if I step away from the mike? Good, all right. How are we doing? What are our numbers? Well, big tech firms have a reputation of being boys clubs. Yahoo -- all right, let's skip Yahoo for a moment. Google, Twitter, Apple, 70 percent of their workforces are male.</p><p>What do you think our profession looks like? What percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors at colleges and universities in this country are female?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Someone studied before the test.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BAYER: True, true. All right. So there are my numbers, my cute graphic. All right. So calculated maybe slightly differently. But 22 percent in the most recent academic year are of tenured and tenure- track faculty are women.</p><p>What about racial and ethnic minority, black or Hispanic economists? What percentage do you think that is? Ten? Oh, less than 10? Do I hear any others? Five.</p><p>These numbers, by the way, are from the UAQ (ph). Some of you fill that out every year, some of you don't. So we do have a problem with response rate, missing data. But the numbers I calculate there are fairly consistent year to year, and across other surveys as well. So this is an accurate impression (inaudible) an accurate number.</p><p>So maybe it's a legacy effect. Maybe over time we'll diversify a bit more. So let's get a sense of what the younger cohorts are showing.</p><p>Looking at new Ph.D.s over the last three years, 33 percent are female. It's a pretty low number. And it does not compare well to other disciplines. What's happening in other fields is they're represented political science, 48 percent. Then (ph) Ph.D.s, 50 percent female.</p><p>Generally, folks are surprised. Racially, we see a similar pattern. For new Ph.D.s, 8 percent of new Ph.D.s -- this is looking at U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- are black or Hispanic. If we include temporary residents, the total drops to 3 percent.</p><p>In the other disciplines, 17 and 12 respectively across the political science and the STEM fields. \"STEM\" means science, technology, engineering and math.</p><p>I'm sorry?</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BAYER: Oh, sure, sure, sure. So if the numbers here -- 8 percent, 17 percent, 12 percent -- exclude new Ph.D.s by temporary residents, if we include those Ph.D. recipients, the numbers drop to 3 percent, 13 percent, and 8 percent. So we do have a high participation rate in our discipline of temporary residents in Ph.D. programs.</p><p>So maybe even younger cohorts will save us. All right. So let's move back a stage in the pipeline and look at undergraduate students. Any guesses?</p><p>Better. All right. So what do you think the number is for econ majors who are female? What percentage? Thirty to 40, yes. How do you think that compares to the other disciplines? Poorly? In a word, yes.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BAYER: So depending on how inclusive we are when we consider what a STEM major is changes the numbers slightly, but not very much at all. So it is true physics, and slightly less diverse than we are in these dimensions, but not a whole lot less.</p><p>And math, for instance, I think 48 percent of math majors are female. So we're behind. We're doing poorly. All right. Here, black and Hispanic econ majors constitute 12 percent; political science, 24; STEM, 20 percent.</p><p>OK. Well, maybe this is not great, but getting better. No. Over the last 50 years almost, we see the proportion of econ majors who are female. We experienced a sharp increase in the '70s, but since have plateaued.</p><p>There's really no reason to believe change will occur without distinct, intentional action on our parts. We see a similar message when we look at racial and ethnic diversity amongst undergraduate students. Economics is behind -- behind all majors, and specifically here, behind political science and STEM majors. And there's little upward trend.</p><p>Convinced that it was worth the trip today? So far, so good, or so bad? So we have a problem. Does it matter? Yes, problems matter.</p><p>We see data. Do they matter? What are the possible consequences of the numbers that we've seen, the lack of diversity in our discipline? Who are they? Who are these people?</p><p>Nobeloriates (ph) in economics, 75 of them over the last 46 years. So what are some possible consequences? Just hypothesize, speculate. What are some possible consequences of (inaudible) economists?</p><p>Not being as diverse as the rest of the population. Sure. Anybody? You don't see yourself there. What effect does that have on students?</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BAYER: Eloquently said, and captures I think all three of these dimensions of consequence, or maybe six dimensions, right? The consequences of the lack of diversity in our profession are both inequity and inefficiency.</p><p>It's not just about being nice to certain people, to include them in our fun work. But it's about getting efficient allocations through the people who join our profession in creating the body of knowledge we are responsible for expanding, and in making government policy.</p><p>So around the academy, within economics and outside, researchers have been looking at the consequences of not diversifying groups. The consequences of homogeneity. And the research takes two strands.</p><p>Well, of course we want to pull from 100 percent of the talent pool. That's a given. But it has consequences even beyond that issue. And I've kind of given you a couple representative papers within each strand.</p><p>The first strand says diversity brings a greater range of insights and perspectives. If we have a broader group of people, we have a broader set of ideas.</p><p>The second strand says there's something special about mixed groups. It changes group dynamics. The behavior of individuals is different depending on the composition of the group in which they're (inaudible).</p><p>And yes, there are challenges to being a mixed group; in communication, maybe in trust. But there are also distinct benefits proved by laboratory research and on the ground. Some of the research has problems with looking for causation. But others very distinctly show that mixed groups are more successful in solving problems, especially complex problems, in part because the participants work harder, spend longer, prepare more, than in homogeneous groups. So I'd be happy to answer questions about any of these papers later. But at this point I'm trying to give a high-level overview and let you know that details exist.</p><p>I want to show you details from one paper. You may know it. May, McGarvey and Weibels (ph) recently surveyed all AEA members with Ph.D.s working in the U.S., Ph.D.s from U.S. economic departments. Pretty similar group, except they disaggregated survey responses by gender.</p><p>I've chosen four items. There were many, many items, most of which had distinct, statistically-significant differences in responses. Along the bottom, I showed statements. And the respondents were free to respond on a scale from one to five whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement.</p><p>So for instance, you can see that women were 21 percentage points more likely to disagree with the statement that the U.S. has an excessive amount of government regulation of economic activity. Even more striking, my daughter said this is the only statistic I had to show all day.</p><p>With the statement, \"Job opportunities for men and women in the U.S. are approximately equal,\" 58 percent of female economists disagreed with that statement, 16 percent of male economists...</p><p>In questions about economic principles and theory, there was similarity amongst respondents, but disagreement on interpretation of economic outcomes, and on recommendations for policy work different, even after controlling these numbers, control for vintage of degree, place of employment, and so on.</p><p>So we have a problem, that's the bad news. The good new is there's something we can do about it. What can we do? Well, we can patch the pipeline, or try. So this is a familiar analogy to those working not only in economics, but in many other disciplines, for thinking about what happens to people on their way to us.</p><p>And they might start in high school or college, and move forward, and perhaps take a Ph.D. program, and perhaps complete it, and then perhaps go into the academy, and perhaps (inaudible) tenure-track job, and perhaps get tenure, and ultimately promotion. And there's been a lot of excellent research on that process, understanding why perhaps women and minorities leak out at higher rates than do others.</p><p>There's been a lot of excellent work on initiatives designed to address those identified problems. But I think the framing of the issue as a pipeline causes us to think about the supply of people coming to us. We're sitting here, all settled in our profession, waiting for the supply to be delivered to us. And it takes attention away from what we could be doing.</p><p>My students know, right? Solution to anything lies in supply and demand, right? There are two sides to every market, and we need to give more attention to the demand side of the market. That's a little scary, because when we think about labor-market discrimination, we think on the supply side there're human-capital attributes and others, and on the demand side, there's animus and statistical discrimination.</p><p>And that indeed may be happening, but (inaudible) a lot more. We present an environment, and the people coming to us and through us are interacting with that environment. They're not acting in a vacuum. We have certain attitudes, beliefs, habits, culture, that we're presenting, and we need to reflect on, and perhaps improve.</p><p>So here's some results from the literature on why women and members of under-represented minority groups may not be becoming economists at the rate that white men are. Each looked (inaudible), competitiveness, yada-yada-yada, role models. Begins to think about the dynamic between the identity of the students and the environment we present.</p><p>But there are other ways we can examine the environment. And so in the rest of my talk, and perhaps in the rest of the day, you will hear about some of these other factors.</p><p>So first, we can advance diversity by addressing implicit biases. Implicit biases happen without us knowing about it. Implicit biases are these automatic associations that we've been trained by society, and media, and others, to make.</p><p>So a member from a particular group, we instantaneously associate with a particular attribute. It's outside our conscious awareness. So whereas animus-based and statistical discrimination characterize explicit conscious choices, we're talking about another kind of action, another kind of decision that -- almost every moment. Because every moment, we're bringing in, as the cognitive scientists estimate, 11 million bits of information, and we only have capacity to compute or deal with 40 bits.</p><p>So these automatic associations take over. As you can see, this is linked to the literature now that we have been fruitfully incorporating into our work in the form of behavioral economics.</p><p>So psychologists and others show that most of the population is no longer explicitly biased. At least responses to surveys will show respondents denying explicit biases, or revealing few explicit biases. But most of us are implicitly biased.</p><p>So just like you might associate green with go and red with stop, we have these trained impulses. You can test yourself for your implicit associations by going to Implicit.Harvard.edu, and they have a wide variety of tests you can take. They're kind of fun. These are just a few of the tests available.</p><p>Do you make an automatic association between women and not- science, or women and science? You can find out, along with many other tests.</p><p>Note that psychologists rely on responses to these tests to measure an individual's degree of implicit bias in various dimensions and associations. But they also have other kinds of tests to measure implicit biases, where they hook subjects up to machines and measure heart rate and brain activity to identify when implicit biases or conflicts with implicit associations internalized have been identified.</p><p>Where do implicit biases come from? I pulled this from January's meeting. Now many of you may not have noticed. I just had to make a big deal of it.</p><p>So this is for our great job market. And we have two white hands shaking. One might be a female, because there are four buttons on the suit I guess. But the shirt doesn't look very female. At least it's adorned as a male, that hand is.</p><p>So I don't know whether this reflects implicit biases, or just engenders them. But they're everywhere. And I want to say we are all implicitly biased. Research has shown that women are just as likely to be implicitly biased against other women as men are.</p><p>So it's not about pointing fingers. It's about examining ourselves, and identifying where we might make associations that we don't want to be making, and then taking steps to de-bias. And there are distinct steps we can take.</p><p>So there is oodles of experiments demonstrating implicit biases, and how they affect decisions. Again, I can give you the details later if you wish, but the professional decisions of physicians and police officers have been demonstrated to correlate with the implicit biases, and seem to be heavily influenced by implicit biases. Certainly, job market decisions of many types have been explored with the lens of implicit biases.</p><p>And there are other results, which I think future speakers today will be discussing. So I'll move on, and just note that there are things we can do about it. You will see more explicit interventions later, I hope. But to give you a sense, note that economists have acknowledged the presence of implicit biases, and have thought of ways to address them.</p><p>So Price and Wolfers looked at NBA referees. And because it's a snap judgment that a referee might make in the moment to decide whether to call a personal foul on a player or not, but to be generated by an implicit bias, rather than by some long, thought-out decision involving statistical or animus-based discrimination.</p><p>And there was a pattern of behavior, a perverse pattern of behavior, where referees were less likely to call fouls on own-race players. This study got a lot of attention. And the referees want to do their job. They want to be impartial.</p><p>And so then the economists went back and collected more data after the publicity storm, and the bias was gone. So that gives hope that there are things individuals can do to de-bias. Awareness is the first step.</p><p>Other general strategies include time, clarity and accountability, where accountability is just the idea that after you make a decision, hold yourself accountable for it. Explain to yourself why you made that decision. Why did you (inaudible)? It wasn't just a feeling. You better have specific reasons you can tell yourself. That makes it a less-likely bias decision if you're going to have to do that in the future.</p><p>And training. As I said, there are many steps, explicit evidence-based steps you can take to de-bias. The Bank of England is offering training on implicit bias to all of its officers. And as of two years ago, got through a third. And so I imagine they've completed the rounds.</p><p>Second, we can advance diversity by being attentive to micro- inequities; the idea that in every interaction there is potential for unfair and inefficient treatment. It's not just at the formal gateways to our profession. It's not just when we are deciding whom to hire or interview, or which students to accept into our programs.</p><p>But it's a day-to-day, moment-to-moment kind of interaction. We might have the opportunity to stop and chat with a student in the hall, or to respond in a constructive way, or a personal way to their comment in class.</p><p>So recently, researchers conducted a field experiment in academia. The subjects were over 6,000 professors working in Ph.D. programs across all disciplines in top universities. And they got an e-mail. Each of these professors got an e-mail from a fictitious student.</p><p>The student requested a meeting to occur in a week for 10 minutes to talk about the possibility of entering the program, specifically or in general. But the only thing that varied across females was the name of the student making the request. And the names were tested so that they were well identified with respect to their gender and race.</p><p>The results, I think it's pretty impressive so many people responded to this anonymous student. But significantly, specifically significant differences in response rates, and in meeting-acceptance rates between white males and all the others.</p><p>So it's not just Emily and Lakisha (ph) who are getting differences in treatments, it's our students. So a bit more detail, the lurid details of this investigation. Disaggregating by general category of discipline, you see business programs have the biggest discriminatory gap.</p><p>So just so you can read the table, it indicates that 62 percent of women and minority students got a response, 25 percent more, totalling 87 percent of Caucasian males, received a response. We are down in the social-sciences group, which includes economics, plus 18 other disciplines, psychology, sociology, urban studies, criminology, area studies, gender studies, the like.</p><p>So I begged, but I did not get data for economists from the researchers. So I respect that. But in a way, it doesn't matter. In a way, we should be attentive to micro-inequities and implicit biases, regardless of what group averages are.</p><p>We need to -- we have the obligation and the power to examine our own behavior and improve it. And I'm talking to myself as much as to you. Please don't get me wrong. The researchers did find correlations. Higher-paid professions, private universities, were more likely to -- or had bigger gaps, discriminatory gaps. They also discovered that higher percentage females or minority disciplines had no bearing on the discriminatory gap.</p><p>A woman contacting a woman, or a member of a particular racial and ethnic group contacting a professor of similar group, no bearing, except for I think Chinese males did benefit from contacting a Chinese professor. By the way, Chinese students were the most discriminated group in this group. But all racial and gender groups experienced discrimination for the most part, except Caucasian males.</p><p>Next category, we can advance diversity by re-examining our rules and practices. So sometimes you see the advice, and it's not bad advice, that recognizing the role that implicit bias plays in our behavior, the solution is to make more rules. So there's less scope for our impulses to take over.</p><p>But we better be darn careful about making those rules, because rules, and practices and habits can embody discrimination, racism, sexism themselves. So just like a facially, neutral practice like voter I.D. laws can have disparate effects on different groups. So, too, can our explicit and implicit rules.</p><p>More a problem than a solution. But then I write, \"Rules have (ph) its practices and culture, have systematically and unintentionally advantaged or disadvantaged members of particular groups.\"</p><p>So these are not only explicit rules, but implicit ones; rules of thumb we use. My favorite paper on the topic is by Ian Haney Lopez from the (inaudible) Journal in 2000. Of course, he was looking at whether the practice was legal under current statutes.</p><p>But he found that grand jurors in L.A. county were at the time, I think, 5 or 6 percent Hispanic, whereas, the population was over 40 percent Hispanic. There is great disparity in who is making judgments on defendants, and who the defendants were.</p><p>And there was lots of testimony by the judges whose job it was to appoint grand jurors. And they sincerely and, on the stand, said they did not intend to discriminate. But the effect was discrimination. And it was discovered that, you know, the rule of thumb for finding grand jurors was to use social networks so you could find people who would do good jobs, and take the position responsibly. But using that practice had the effect of creating disparity and disadvantage for members of certain groups.</p><p>So we need to think about, in our own lives, what habits, or rules of thumb, or written rules we use to make decisions, and whether they too can be creating, unintentionally, disparities.</p><p>Lastly, and this is kind of a living out, an attempt to live out recommendations from the other three points. We can advance diversity by changing the way we present economics to students. And I know not all of you are teachers here. But I want to introduce you to my project that Janice kindly mentioned earlier. It's called, \"Diversifying Economic Quality,\" short, Div-E-Q, which is an online resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics. It's a wiki, right?</p><p>So people send me ideas. Of course, my students and I, and my colleagues, research and cover a lot of useful ideas, teaching tips to give professors and departments. But it's also a forum where we can exchange ideas as for how to improve our interactions with students, and our students' connections to our discipline.</p><p>Because as you saw from the numbers, we have a problem at the undergraduate level. And I think there's something more we can do to attract a more diverse body of students to our very excellent discipline.</p><p>So here are some ideas, the front page of the resource. I don't know if you can see it from where you're sitting, but I'll just read out a couple of points. It gives you tips for how to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classes, how you could take an implicit association test to detect any implicit associations you might be making, how to offer wise criticism. I think a speaker later today will be talking about that, and so on.</p><p>So there are large and small things you can find here. And we also present an assessment of the evidence. Some of these strategies have been documented as being better for students. They're evidence- based strategies, better for all students, and often particularly for students who are female or racial and ethnic minority. Members of under-represented groups do very well when we think carefully about how to make economics relevant to their lives.</p><p>So here's a summary of my talk. We're not very diverse. Increasing our diversity would enhance efficiency and equity. And we can work on the demand side. We can change the environment we create. It gives us something to do, right? Not that we didn't have enough.</p><p>But, you know, we have the power and the obligation to do all we can to address the system -- or situation. So those are the four points. And now I'd like to end with a guidepost for where we can go the rest of today, and in months ahead.</p><p>You'll be getting more instruction and prompts throughout the day, just a way to organize productive conversation. But to get a mindset prepared, I really would like you to identify a partner right now, and exchange e-mail addresses, and commit to following up with your partner in January to see if you've actually done anything that you're potentially committing to do today.</p><p>Second point, commit to do today at least one personal and one departmental initiative. And then of course, I think you've seen on the tables or elsewhere, we have a -- or the Fed, the board has put up an e-mail address. So (inaudible) now, or in months ahead, you can send questions or comments to the board, and we promise someone will read them and respond. So I'd love to take questions. But at this moment, find a partner and exchange contact information please.</p><p>(ACTIVITY)</p><p>I love the energy. So I want to make two notes, organizational notes. One is on each table there's a (inaudible) giving you the e- mail address, and a hashtag if you're a tweeting type. I know we used to (inaudible) who's tweeting out the conference. Others can as well.</p><p>I am prepared to take questions now, or in private conversation later. Any questions pressing? Yes?</p><p>All right. So there's a question. I'm sorry to like cut the flow of conversation. But I promise there'll be plenty of opportunities to talk more. I really like it.</p><p>So the question is about this slide.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) So the first groups are more innovative and they're more successful, and solving problems. However, what research also shows is that these groups don't notice this themselves. So actually, when you ask more diverse groups in the lab after they have made these better performance, they think that they performed worse.</p><p>And why do they think that they performed worse? They think so because they had a sort of unpleasant experience. There was more disagreement in the groups. There was more discussion. It took longer to reach this better decision. It took them longer. And it involved more energy from their side.</p><p>And that is something I think we need to think a lot about. How can we make -- how can we make people like diversity? How can we make ourselves like diversity? How can we step out of that comfort zone? And I think it's, just as an important point to make here, as not only concluding that more diverse groups are more innovative and make better solutions, reach better solutions, but also that they don't notice. How can we make them notice?</p><p>BAYER: Great. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Yes.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BAYER: Sure. I'll post them. I think Janice said the board would be hosting -- OK. We'll work on it. OK.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) One of the things I do is I have students on their exams put their student I.D. numbers, not their names. A lot of people have probably tried that. I believe it works. But I've read a little about, heard a little about letters of recommendation bias.</p><p>And one of the things my colleague from the psyche department taught me to do is to have a checklist for specific jobs. I always have a checklist of skills, regardless of the applicant's skills, that would be valuable to the employer, and make sure I go down the checklist. Because the data shows that faculty describe women much differently than they describe men.</p><p>So just basic rules like that that are neutral can be quick to do, and make job easier.</p><p>BAYER: Great. Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) It's important to have a separation of minority females from Caucasian females. So all your information provided was on females. Did you -- or did the people who did these different studies and research, did they separate it out to see if there is -- still a bias even more so that impacts minority females versus non?</p><p>BAYER: So in reality, these intersections are really important. And the experiences of white women on average are different than for women in other racial and ethnic groups.</p><p>So some of the studies I showed only did the gender dimension. Some did only racial or ethnic dimension. The one study on professors' response had enough observations that they could disaggregate by race and gender. That's a numbers problem that a lot of research has. So we have to kind of extrapolate what we learn by studying some dimensions of difference to what possibly might be going on in others.</p><p>QUESTION: I'm Donna Ginter (ph). I've done some work on women of color, science. And what we found is that the sort of binding constraint is more race than gender. And so if you have gender parity -- if you look at life science, 50 percent, or over 50 percent of Ph.D.s or in life sciences go to women.</p><p>But if you look at women of color in life science, the race dimension that affects their success relative to the gender. And a colleague of mine calls this \"distance from privilege,\" in that white women are much closer to privilege, which we view as white men, compared with women of color.</p><p>BAYER: Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: I just wondered if you also have available to distribute a breakdown of the initial statistics you gave, that also show family income or resources in addition to race and gender, just to see what the breakdown is there as well? Because one of the barriers may also, in addition to race and gender, may have to do with income. And I'd just be curious to see how important that is. And it may not break any which way, but it'd be fun to see.</p><p>BAYER: Right. So in that way, gender is a controlled experiment, because generally, the income backgrounds are the same across genders. Those particular data don't have the information associated with them. But I think there are studies. I could look them up for you.</p><p>QUESTION: I was just wondering -- I wish I knew. I was just wondering if anyone here knows essentially when these college majors are chosen? Sam and I were discussing it. Your statistics suggest that the problem exists already in college, so well before even graduate school, or things like that. And where are good times to intervene to assist, you know, in getting a more diverse group of students into economics?</p><p>BAYER: So I know of interventions -- microphone's being passed. I know of interventions that start as early as high school. I think Jane Katz (ph) is in the room who does math.</p><p>The board does math by econ. Is that how we say that out loud? And so the board has a program here, and in various reserve banks you might know about, to try to get I think under-represented groups more excited and knowledgeable about econ earlier.</p><p>Most of the interventions -- we hear about some awesome interventions today. And most of them do take place I believe at later stages of the pipeline. There's the -- well, I think we'll hear about the summer program, which is for college students, and then the Div-E-Q that I do is at that level.</p><p>QUESTION: I have a paper coming out any day now about women in academic science careers. And we were looking specifically at mathematically-intensive fields, including economics. So we separated economics out from the rest of the social sciences.</p><p>We have a figure in our paper that shows the number of Ph.D. students, percentage of Ph.D. students, female, and the average GOE (ph) quantitative score, and it's a downward sloping line. So you have economics, engineering and math, you know, the percentages of females are low, and the (inaudible) scores to get into graduate school are high.</p><p>And one of the recommendations from our paper is it's math, and it's math that starts early, middle school and high school, because by the time they get to college, they may not even be able to take those college courses necessary to be successful in these mathematically- intensive fields.</p><p>BAYER: Yes? We'll make this the last question. Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: Just in relation to the question, so there's a recent -- it was like the previous issue of the SEJ (ph) has an article examining the role model type (inaudible) mainly. But they have a nice identification strategy, where they use visiting professors who are not -- or new professors that are not assigned when the students register, just to see whether gender matters.</p><p>And so it doesn't seem that it matters then, which -- and it kind of suggests that it starts before the major declaration, and before college. So it's kind of disheartening to read that paper because of that, right? So maybe by the time that they get there, we're too late.</p><p>BAYER: Well, I know of a paper that uses the random assignment of students to professors at West Point, I think Paige Carroll (ph), another author, looked at that and saw that while male students weren't affected by the gender, the professor -- female students definitely were, and majored in science, STEM fields, maybe even econ as a result of that early exposure to a role model.</p><p>So there are things in the profession we can do. I'm -- I think we have so much more to learn. And with random assignment experiments producing so much information on the nature of the barriers, and the implicit bias, and whatnot, that exists in our environment, that we can really make progress, both in our research as economists, but also in our actions and procedures as economists.</p><p>I said that was the last question. I see another hand, OK.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) And this starts in the seventh grade. So I was teaching seventh-graders. So I noticed that the women in my class -- this was in Oakland, California. This isn't (ph) when I was in Berkeley. And it seems the women in my class were suffering in the same way. The girls in the class are suffering in the same way.</p><p>So I think it starts about that time. There were definite roles that were assigned to boys and girls before I got there. And they -- I'm not saying that I'm the intervention, but just to be clear. But it was a summer program, and you didn't see these dramatic differences in women and girls speaking up and participating in problem-solving, and in public problem-solving. So I think that it's much earlier than high school.</p><p>BAYER: But there are steps we can take then to counter those forces that may be present before we see our students. All right. Thank you so much. We have a 15-minute break. At 10:30 our next speaker will begin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200009875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:510Y-B521-JCRM-B026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Data Licensing, LLC.

Thank you, Janice, for the kind introduction. It's been a joy to work with you over the last 10 months.  And thank you, Chair Yellen, for your insightful remarks, and your inspiring presence in our profession.  </p><p>      It's an honor to work with all of you today in this room.  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come together and think about the very important issue before us; diversity in the economics profession.  </p><p>      I know and respect the work that many of you have done, and I am excited to map out a plan of action with you.  The board, and in particular, Deputy Director Janice Shack-Marquez, and Director David Wilcox, have shown remarkable leadership in bringing us together today to open a profession-wide dialogue about diversity.  </p><p>      The commitment displayed by all the officers I've met with here is invigorating and powerful.  In this room we have these esteemed board staff, Federal Reserve Bank presidents and research directors, chairs of top economics departments from around the country, economists who have made significant contributions to understanding and addressing diversity, and leading scholars from other disciplines.  </p><p>      We have the opportunity today to put our diverse heads together and produce lasting change in our profession.  Echoing the chair's remarks, our objective is to create a profession that recruits and promotes the individuals best able to bring the energy, fresh insights and renewals, that our discipline needs to be healthy and thrive.    </p><p>      Over the course of the day, we will hear from a dream team of speakers and panelists who will share their research and their work on the ground.  I am truly excited to attend this conference.  They will expose us to examples of successful diversity initiatives in economics and around academia.    </p><p>      The presentations will help us understand the impediments to diversity and will, importantly, introduce us to evidence-based interventions we can support.  Listen with the goal of developing a list of actions and initiatives that you believe hold promise as being practicable and effective.  </p><p>      In the afternoon, we will have opportunities to share and refine our ideas through group discussions.  By the end of the day, each of us should be able to identify several initiatives, large or small, which excite us.    </p><p>      To make it concrete, set a personal goal of writing down two specific actions, one each of the personal and departmental levels, that you are willing to adopt to help our profession attract and develop the best people and best ideas.  In my talk this morning, I will provide background information and a framework to organize and develop knowledge through the rest of the day.    </p><p>      All right.  So now I get to be a teacher rather than a speaker, much more practice at speaking.  I want this to be an academic conference.  I want us to converse.  If you want to ask me questions during the presentation, feel free afterwards or in conversation later.  </p><p>      All right.  So my presentation has three parts.  First, I present data on diversity in the profession.  And in the next section, I briefly discuss possible consequences of having a more or less diverse profession.    </p><p>      In the last section, I lay the groundwork for our plan of attack. I offer an economist's take on the diversity literature produced in a wide variety of fields, highlighting strands of diversity research that may be less familiar, and connecting them to the logic and research that we economists have done.  </p><p>      First, a note on the meaning of the term \"diversity.\"  While certainly other kinds of diversity are important and productive, our focus today is on groups that have been historically under-represented in our profession and in our country; women, African-Americans and Hispanics.  </p><p>      The inclusion of people and perspectives from these groups is essential to the vitality of our profession and policymaking.  But as we learn about the barriers faced by members of these groups, we develop general knowledge that is transferrable, facilitating the inclusion of the best people and the best ideas from all groups.  </p><p>      Can you hear me if I step away from the mike?  Good, all right. How are we doing?  What are our numbers?  Well, big tech firms have a reputation of being boys clubs.  Yahoo -- all right, let's skip Yahoo for a moment.  Google, Twitter, Apple, 70 percent of their workforces are male.  </p><p>      What do you think our profession looks like?  What percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors at colleges and universities in this country are female?    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Someone studied before the test.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  True, true.  All right.  So there are my numbers, my cute graphic.  All right.  So calculated maybe slightly differently.  But 22 percent in the most recent academic year are of tenured and tenure- track faculty are women.    </p><p>      What about racial and ethnic minority, black or Hispanic economists?  What percentage do you think that is?  Ten?  Oh, less than 10?  Do I hear any others?  Five.  </p><p>      These numbers, by the way, are from the UAQ (ph).  Some of you fill that out every year, some of you don't.  So we do have a problem with response rate, missing data.  But the numbers I calculate there are fairly consistent year to year, and across other surveys as well. So this is an accurate impression (inaudible) an accurate number.  </p><p>      So maybe it's a legacy effect.  Maybe over time we'll diversify a bit more.  So let's get a sense of what the younger cohorts are showing.    </p><p>      Looking at new Ph.D.s over the last three years, 33 percent are female.  It's a pretty low number.  And it does not compare well to other disciplines.  What's happening in other fields is they're represented political science, 48 percent.  Then (ph) Ph.D.s, 50 percent female.  </p><p>      Generally, folks are surprised.  Racially, we see a similar pattern.  For new Ph.D.s, 8 percent of new Ph.D.s -- this is looking at U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- are black or Hispanic.  If we include temporary residents, the total drops to 3 percent.    </p><p>      In the other disciplines, 17 and 12 respectively across the political science and the STEM fields.  \"STEM\" means science, technology, engineering and math.    </p><p>      I'm sorry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Oh, sure, sure, sure.  So if the numbers here -- 8 percent, 17 percent, 12 percent -- exclude new Ph.D.s by temporary residents, if we include those Ph.D. recipients, the numbers drop to 3 percent, 13 percent, and 8 percent.  So we do have a high participation rate in our discipline of temporary residents in Ph.D. programs.  </p><p>      So maybe even younger cohorts will save us.  All right.  So let's move back a stage in the pipeline and look at undergraduate students. Any guesses?    </p><p>      Better.  All right.  So what do you think the number is for econ majors who are female?  What percentage?  Thirty to 40, yes.  How do you think that compares to the other disciplines?  Poorly?  In a word, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So depending on how inclusive we are when we consider what a STEM major is changes the numbers slightly, but not very much at all.  So it is true physics, and slightly less diverse than we are in these dimensions, but not a whole lot less.    </p><p>      And math, for instance, I think 48 percent of math majors are female.  So we're behind.  We're doing poorly.  All right.  Here, black and Hispanic econ majors constitute 12 percent; political science, 24; STEM, 20 percent.  </p><p>      OK.  Well, maybe this is not great, but getting better.  No. Over the last 50 years almost, we see the proportion of econ majors who are female.  We experienced a sharp increase in the '70s, but since have plateaued.   </p><p>      There's really no reason to believe change will occur without distinct, intentional action on our parts.  We see a similar message when we look at racial and ethnic diversity amongst undergraduate students.  Economics is behind -- behind all majors, and specifically here, behind political science and STEM majors.  And there's little upward trend.  </p><p>      Convinced that it was worth the trip today?  So far, so good, or so bad?  So we have a problem.  Does it matter?  Yes, problems matter.   </p><p>      We see data.  Do they matter?  What are the possible consequences of the numbers that we've seen, the lack of diversity in our discipline?  Who are they?  Who are these people?  </p><p>      Nobeloriates (ph) in economics, 75 of them over the last 46 years.  So what are some possible consequences?  Just hypothesize, speculate.  What are some possible consequences of (inaudible) economists?  </p><p>      Not being as diverse as the rest of the population.  Sure. Anybody?  You don't see yourself there.  What effect does that have on students?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Eloquently said, and captures I think all three of these dimensions of consequence, or maybe six dimensions, right?  The consequences of the lack of diversity in our profession are both inequity and inefficiency.    </p><p>      It's not just about being nice to certain people, to include them in our fun work.  But it's about getting efficient allocations through the people who join our profession in creating the body of knowledge we are responsible for expanding, and in making government policy.  </p><p>      So around the academy, within economics and outside, researchers have been looking at the consequences of not diversifying groups.  The consequences of homogeneity.  And the research takes two strands.    </p><p>      Well, of course we want to pull from 100 percent of the talent pool.  That's a given.  But it has consequences even beyond that issue.  And I've kind of given you a couple representative papers within each strand.  </p><p>      The first strand says diversity brings a greater range of insights and perspectives.  If we have a broader group of people, we have a broader set of ideas.    </p><p>      The second strand says there's something special about mixed groups.  It changes group dynamics.  The behavior of individuals is different depending on the composition of the group in which they're (inaudible).  </p><p>      And yes, there are challenges to being a mixed group; in communication, maybe in trust.  But there are also distinct benefits proved by laboratory research and on the ground.  Some of the research has problems with looking for causation.  But others very distinctly show that mixed groups are more successful in solving problems, especially complex problems, in part because the participants work harder, spend longer, prepare more, than in homogeneous groups.    </p><p>      So I'd be happy to answer questions about any of these papers later.  But at this point I'm trying to give a high-level overview and let you know that details exist.    </p><p>      I want to show you details from one paper.  You may know it. May, McGarvey and Weibels (ph) recently surveyed all AEA members with Ph.D.s working in the U.S., Ph.D.s from U.S. economic departments. Pretty similar group, except they disaggregated survey responses by gender.  </p><p>      I've chosen four items.  There were many, many items, most of which had distinct, statistically-significant differences in responses.  Along the bottom, I showed statements.  And the respondents were free to respond on a scale from one to five whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement.  </p><p>      So for instance, you can see that women were 21 percentage points more likely to disagree with the statement that the U.S. has an excessive amount of government regulation of economic activity.  Even more striking, my daughter said this is the only statistic I had to show all day.  </p><p>      With the statement, \"Job opportunities for men and women in the U.S. are approximately equal,\" 58 percent of female economists disagreed with that statement, 16 percent of male economists...  </p><p>      In questions about economic principles and theory, there was similarity amongst respondents, but disagreement on interpretation of economic outcomes, and on recommendations for policy work different, even after controlling these numbers, control for vintage of degree, place of employment, and so on.  </p><p>      So we have a problem, that's the bad news.  The good new is there's something we can do about it.  What can we do?  Well, we can patch the pipeline, or try.  So this is a familiar analogy to those working not only in economics, but in many other disciplines, for thinking about what happens to people on their way to us.    </p><p>      And they might start in high school or college, and move forward, and perhaps take a Ph.D. program, and perhaps complete it, and then perhaps go into the academy, and perhaps (inaudible) tenure-track job, and perhaps get tenure, and ultimately promotion.  And there's been a lot of excellent research on that process, understanding why perhaps women and minorities leak out at higher rates than do others.  </p><p>      There's been a lot of excellent work on initiatives designed to address those identified problems.  But I think the framing of the issue as a pipeline causes us to think about the supply of people coming to us.  We're sitting here, all settled in our profession, waiting for the supply to be delivered to us.  And it takes attention away from what we could be doing. </p><p>      My students know, right?  Solution to anything lies in supply and demand, right?  There are two sides to every market, and we need to give more attention to the demand side of the market.  That's a little scary, because when we think about labor-market discrimination, we think on the supply side there're human-capital attributes and others, and on the demand side, there's animus and statistical discrimination.   </p><p>      And that indeed may be happening, but (inaudible) a lot more.  We present an environment, and the people coming to us and through us are interacting with that environment.  They're not acting in a vacuum. We have certain attitudes, beliefs, habits, culture, that we're presenting, and we need to reflect on, and perhaps improve.  </p><p>      So here's some results from the literature on why women and members of under-represented minority groups may not be becoming economists at the rate that white men are.  Each looked (inaudible), competitiveness, yada-yada-yada, role models.  Begins to think about the dynamic between the identity of the students and the environment we present.   </p><p>      But there are other ways we can examine the environment.  And so in the rest of my talk, and perhaps in the rest of the day, you will hear about some of these other factors.    </p><p>      So first, we can advance diversity by addressing implicit biases. Implicit biases happen without us knowing about it.  Implicit biases are these automatic associations that we've been trained by society, and media, and others, to make.    </p><p>      So a member from a particular group, we instantaneously associate with a particular attribute.  It's outside our conscious awareness. So whereas animus-based and statistical discrimination characterize explicit conscious choices, we're talking about another kind of action, another kind of decision that -- almost every moment.  Because every moment, we're bringing in, as the cognitive scientists estimate, 11 million bits of information, and we only have capacity to compute or deal with 40 bits.  </p><p>      So these automatic associations take over.  As you can see, this is linked to the literature now that we have been fruitfully incorporating into our work in the form of behavioral economics.    </p><p>      So psychologists and others show that most of the population is no longer explicitly biased.  At least responses to surveys will show respondents denying explicit biases, or revealing few explicit biases. But most of us are implicitly biased.  </p><p>      So just like you might associate green with go and red with stop, we have these trained impulses.  You can test yourself for your implicit associations by going to Implicit.Harvard.edu, and they have a wide variety of tests you can take.  They're kind of fun.  These are just a few of the tests available.  </p><p>      Do you make an automatic association between women and not- science, or women and science?  You can find out, along with many other tests.   </p><p>      Note that psychologists rely on responses to these tests to measure an individual's degree of implicit bias in various dimensions and associations.  But they also have other kinds of tests to measure implicit biases, where they hook subjects up to machines and measure heart rate and brain activity to identify when implicit biases or conflicts with implicit associations internalized have been identified.  </p><p>      Where do implicit biases come from?  I pulled this from January's meeting.  Now many of you may not have noticed.  I just had to make a big deal of it.  </p><p>      So this is for our great job market.  And we have two white hands shaking.  One might be a female, because there are four buttons on the suit I guess.  But the shirt doesn't look very female.  At least it's adorned as a male, that hand is.  </p><p>      So I don't know whether this reflects implicit biases, or just engenders them.  But they're everywhere.  And I want to say we are all implicitly biased.  Research has shown that women are just as likely to be implicitly biased against other women as men are.    </p><p>      So it's not about pointing fingers.  It's about examining ourselves, and identifying where we might make associations that we don't want to be making, and then taking steps to de-bias.  And there are distinct steps we can take.  </p><p>      So there is oodles of experiments demonstrating implicit biases, and how they affect decisions.  Again, I can give you the details later if you wish, but the professional decisions of physicians and police officers have been demonstrated to correlate with the implicit biases, and seem to be heavily influenced by implicit biases. Certainly, job market decisions of many types have been explored with the lens of implicit biases.  </p><p>      And there are other results, which I think future speakers today will be discussing.  So I'll move on, and just note that there are things we can do about it.  You will see more explicit interventions later, I hope.  But to give you a sense, note that economists have acknowledged the presence of implicit biases, and have thought of ways to address them.   </p><p>      So Price and Wolfers looked at NBA referees.  And because it's a snap judgment that a referee might make in the moment to decide whether to call a personal foul on a player or not, but to be generated by an implicit bias, rather than by some long, thought-out decision involving statistical or animus-based discrimination.  </p><p>      And there was a pattern of behavior, a perverse pattern of behavior, where referees were less likely to call fouls on own-race players.  This study got a lot of attention.  And the referees want to do their job.  They want to be impartial.  </p><p>      And so then the economists went back and collected more data after the publicity storm, and the bias was gone.  So that gives hope that there are things individuals can do to de-bias.  Awareness is the first step.  </p><p>      Other general strategies include time, clarity and accountability, where accountability is just the idea that after you make a decision, hold yourself accountable for it.  Explain to yourself why you made that decision.  Why did you (inaudible)?  It wasn't just a feeling.  You better have specific reasons you can tell yourself.  That makes it a less-likely bias decision if you're going to have to do that in the future.  </p><p>      And training.  As I said, there are many steps, explicit evidence-based steps you can take to de-bias.  The Bank of England is offering training on implicit bias to all of its officers.  And as of two years ago, got through a third.  And so I imagine they've completed the rounds.  </p><p>      Second, we can advance diversity by being attentive to micro- inequities; the idea that in every interaction there is potential for unfair and inefficient treatment.  It's not just at the formal gateways to our profession.  It's not just when we are deciding whom to hire or interview, or which students to accept into our programs.    </p><p>      But it's a day-to-day, moment-to-moment kind of interaction.  We might have the opportunity to stop and chat with a student in the hall, or to respond in a constructive way, or a personal way to their comment in class.    </p><p>      So recently, researchers conducted a field experiment in academia.  The subjects were over 6,000 professors working in Ph.D. programs across all disciplines in top universities.  And they got an e-mail.  Each of these professors got an e-mail from a fictitious student.    </p><p>      The student requested a meeting to occur in a week for 10 minutes to talk about the possibility of entering the program, specifically or in general.  But the only thing that varied across females was the name of the student making the request.  And the names were tested so that they were well identified with respect to their gender and race.  </p><p>      The results, I think it's pretty impressive so many people responded to this anonymous student.  But significantly, specifically significant differences in response rates, and in meeting-acceptance rates between white males and all the others.  </p><p>      So it's not just Emily and Lakisha (ph) who are getting differences in treatments, it's our students.  So a bit more detail, the lurid details of this investigation.  Disaggregating by general category of discipline, you see business programs have the biggest discriminatory gap.    </p><p>      So just so you can read the table, it indicates that 62 percent of women and minority students got a response, 25 percent more, totalling 87 percent of Caucasian males, received a response.  We are down in the social-sciences group, which includes economics, plus 18 other disciplines, psychology, sociology, urban studies, criminology, area studies, gender studies, the like. </p><p>      So I begged, but I did not get data for economists from the researchers.  So I respect that.  But in a way, it doesn't matter.  In a way, we should be attentive to micro-inequities and implicit biases, regardless of what group averages are.  </p><p>      We need to -- we have the obligation and the power to examine our own behavior and improve it.  And I'm talking to myself as much as to you.  Please don't get me wrong.    </p><p>      The researchers did find correlations.  Higher-paid professions, private universities, were more likely to -- or had bigger gaps, discriminatory gaps.  They also discovered that higher percentage females or minority disciplines had no bearing on the discriminatory gap.  </p><p>      A woman contacting a woman, or a member of a particular racial and ethnic group contacting a professor of similar group, no bearing, except for I think Chinese males did benefit from contacting a Chinese professor.  By the way, Chinese students were the most discriminated group in this group.  But all racial and gender groups experienced discrimination for the most part, except Caucasian males.  </p><p>      Next category, we can advance diversity by re-examining our rules and practices.  So sometimes you see the advice, and it's not bad advice, that recognizing the role that implicit bias plays in our behavior, the solution is to make more rules.  So there's less scope for our impulses to take over.  </p><p>      But we better be darn careful about making those rules, because rules, and practices and habits can embody discrimination, racism, sexism themselves.  So just like a facially, neutral practice like voter I.D. laws can have disparate effects on different groups.  So, too, can our explicit and implicit rules.  </p><p>      More a problem than a solution.  But then I write, \"Rules have (ph) its practices and culture, have systematically and unintentionally advantaged or disadvantaged members of particular groups.\"  </p><p>      So these are not only explicit rules, but implicit ones; rules of thumb we use.  My favorite paper on the topic is by Ian Haney Lopez from the (inaudible) Journal in 2000.  Of course, he was looking at whether the practice was legal under current statutes.    </p><p>      But he found that grand jurors in L.A. county were at the time, I think, 5 or 6 percent Hispanic, whereas, the population was over 40 percent Hispanic.  There is great disparity in who is making judgments on defendants, and who the defendants were.    </p><p>      And there was lots of testimony by the judges whose job it was to appoint grand jurors.  And they sincerely and, on the stand, said they did not intend to discriminate.  But the effect was discrimination. And it was discovered that, you know, the rule of thumb for finding grand jurors was to use social networks so you could find people who would do good jobs, and take the position responsibly.  But using that practice had the effect of creating disparity and disadvantage for members of certain groups.    </p><p>      So we need to think about, in our own lives, what habits, or rules of thumb, or written rules we use to make decisions, and whether they too can be creating, unintentionally, disparities.  </p><p>      Lastly, and this is kind of a living out, an attempt to live out recommendations from the other three points.  We can advance diversity by changing the way we present economics to students.  </p><p>      And I know not all of you are teachers here.  But I want to introduce you to my project that Janice kindly mentioned earlier. It's called, \"Diversifying Economic Quality,\" short, Div-E-Q, which is an online resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics.  It's a wiki, right?    </p><p>      So people send me ideas.  Of course, my students and I, and my colleagues, research and cover a lot of useful ideas, teaching tips to give professors and departments.  But it's also a forum where we can exchange ideas as for how to improve our interactions with students, and our students' connections to our discipline.  </p><p>      Because as you saw from the numbers, we have a problem at the undergraduate level.  And I think there's something more we can do to attract a more diverse body of students to our very excellent discipline.    </p><p>      So here are some ideas, the front page of the resource.  I don't know if you can see it from where you're sitting, but I'll just read out a couple of points.  It gives you tips for how to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classes, how you could take an implicit association test to detect any implicit associations you might be making, how to offer wise criticism.  I think a speaker later today will be talking about that, and so on.  </p><p>      So there are large and small things you can find here.  And we also present an assessment of the evidence.  Some of these strategies have been documented as being better for students.  They're evidence- based strategies, better for all students, and often particularly for students who are female or racial and ethnic minority.  Members of under-represented groups do very well when we think carefully about how to make economics relevant to their lives.  </p><p>      So here's a summary of my talk.  We're not very diverse. Increasing our diversity would enhance efficiency and equity.  And we can work on the demand side.  We can change the environment we create. It gives us something to do, right?  Not that we didn't have enough.  </p><p>      But, you know, we have the power and the obligation to do all we can to address the system -- or situation.  So those are the four points.  And now I'd like to end with a guidepost for where we can go the rest of today, and in months ahead.  </p><p>      You'll be getting more instruction and prompts throughout the day, just a way to organize productive conversation.  But to get a mindset prepared, I really would like you to identify a partner right now, and exchange e-mail addresses, and commit to following up with your partner in January to see if you've actually done anything that you're potentially committing to do today.    </p><p>      Second point, commit to do today at least one personal and one departmental initiative.  And then of course, I think you've seen on the tables or elsewhere, we have a -- or the Fed, the board has put up an e-mail address.  So (inaudible) now, or in months ahead, you can send questions or comments to the board, and we promise someone will read them and respond.  </p><p>      So I'd love to take questions.  But at this moment, find a partner and exchange contact information please.  </p><p>      (ACTIVITY)  </p><p>      I love the energy.  So I want to make two notes, organizational notes.  One is on each table there's a (inaudible) giving you the e- mail address, and a hashtag if you're a tweeting type.  I know we used to (inaudible) who's tweeting out the conference.  Others can as well.  </p><p>      I am prepared to take questions now, or in private conversation later.  Any questions pressing?  Yes?  </p><p>      All right.  So there's a question.  I'm sorry to like cut the flow of conversation.  But I promise there'll be plenty of opportunities to talk more.  I really like it.  </p><p>      So the question is about this slide.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) So the first groups are more innovative and they're more successful, and solving problems.  However, what research also shows is that these groups don't notice this themselves.  So actually, when you ask more diverse groups in the lab after they have made these better performance, they think that they performed worse.    </p><p>      And why do they think that they performed worse?  They think so because they had a sort of unpleasant experience.  There was more disagreement in the groups.  There was more discussion.  It took longer to reach this better decision.  It took them longer.  And it involved more energy from their side.    </p><p>      And that is something I think we need to think a lot about.  How can we make -- how can we make people like diversity?  How can we make ourselves like diversity?  How can we step out of that comfort zone? And I think it's, just as an important point to make here, as not only concluding that more diverse groups are more innovative and make better solutions, reach better solutions, but also that they don't notice.  How can we make them notice?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Great.  Thank you.  Any other questions or comments? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Sure.  I'll post them.  I think Janice said the board would be hosting -- OK.  We'll work on it.  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) One of the things I do is I have students on their exams put their student I.D. numbers, not their names.  A lot of people have probably tried that.  I believe it works.  But I've read a little about, heard a little about letters of recommendation bias.    </p><p>      And one of the things my colleague from the psyche department taught me to do is to have a checklist for specific jobs.  I always have a checklist of skills, regardless of the applicant's skills, that would be valuable to the employer, and make sure I go down the checklist.  Because the data shows that faculty describe women much differently than they describe men.  </p><p>      So just basic rules like that that are neutral can be quick to do, and make job easier.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) It's important to have a separation of minority females from Caucasian females.  So all your information provided was on females.  Did you -- or did the people who did these different studies and research, did they separate it out to see if there is -- still a bias even more so that impacts minority females versus non?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So in reality, these intersections are really important. And the experiences of white women on average are different than for women in other racial and ethnic groups.    </p><p>      So some of the studies I showed only did the gender dimension. Some did only racial or ethnic dimension.  The one study on professors' response had enough observations that they could disaggregate by race and gender.  That's a numbers problem that a lot of research has.  So we have to kind of extrapolate what we learn by studying some dimensions of difference to what possibly might be going on in others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I'm Donna Ginter (ph).  I've done some work on women of color, science.  And what we found is that the sort of binding constraint is more race than gender.  And so if you have gender parity -- if you look at life science, 50 percent, or over 50 percent of Ph.D.s or in life sciences go to women.  </p><p>      But if you look at women of color in life science, the race dimension that affects their success relative to the gender.  And a colleague of mine calls this \"distance from privilege,\" in that white women are much closer to privilege, which we view as white men, compared with women of color.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I just wondered if you also have available to distribute a breakdown of the initial statistics you gave, that also show family income or resources in addition to race and gender, just to see what the breakdown is there as well?  Because one of the barriers may also, in addition to race and gender, may have to do with income.  And I'd just be curious to see how important that is.  And it may not break any which way, but it'd be fun to see. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Right.  So in that way, gender is a controlled experiment, because generally, the income backgrounds are the same across genders.  Those particular data don't have the information associated with them.  But I think there are studies.  I could look them up for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I was just wondering -- I wish I knew.  I was just wondering if anyone here knows essentially when these college majors are chosen?  Sam and I were discussing it.  Your statistics suggest that the problem exists already in college, so well before even graduate school, or things like that.  And where are good times to intervene to assist, you know, in getting a more diverse group of students into economics?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  So I know of interventions -- microphone's being passed. I know of interventions that start as early as high school.  I think Jane Katz (ph) is in the room who does math.    </p><p>      The board does math by econ.  Is that how we say that out loud? And so the board has a program here, and in various reserve banks you might know about, to try to get I think under-represented groups more excited and knowledgeable about econ earlier.  </p><p>      Most of the interventions -- we hear about some awesome interventions today.  And most of them do take place I believe at later stages of the pipeline.  There's the -- well, I think we'll hear about the summer program, which is for college students, and then the Div-E-Q that I do is at that level.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I have a paper coming out any day now about women in academic science careers.  And we were looking specifically at mathematically-intensive fields, including economics.  So we separated economics out from the rest of the social sciences.    </p><p>      We have a figure in our paper that shows the number of Ph.D. students, percentage of Ph.D. students, female, and the average GOE (ph) quantitative score, and it's a downward sloping line.  So you have economics, engineering and math, you know, the percentages of females are low, and the (inaudible) scores to get into graduate school are high.  </p><p>      And one of the recommendations from our paper is it's math, and it's math that starts early, middle school and high school, because by the time they get to college, they may not even be able to take those college courses necessary to be successful in these mathematically- intensive fields.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Yes?  We'll make this the last question.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Just in relation to the question, so there's a recent -- it was like the previous issue of the SEJ (ph) has an article examining the role model type (inaudible) mainly.  But they have a nice identification strategy, where they use visiting professors who are not -- or new professors that are not assigned when the students register, just to see whether gender matters. </p><p>      And so it doesn't seem that it matters then, which -- and it kind of suggests that it starts before the major declaration, and before college.  So it's kind of disheartening to read that paper because of that, right?  So maybe by the time that they get there, we're too late.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  Well, I know of a paper that uses the random assignment of students to professors at West Point, I think Paige Carroll (ph), another author, looked at that and saw that while male students weren't affected by the gender, the professor -- female students definitely were, and majored in science, STEM fields, maybe even econ as a result of that early exposure to a role model.  </p><p>      So there are things in the profession we can do.  I'm -- I think we have so much more to learn.  And with random assignment experiments producing so much information on the nature of the barriers, and the implicit bias, and whatnot, that exists in our environment, that we can really make progress, both in our research as economists, but also in our actions and procedures as economists.  </p><p>      I said that was the last question.  I see another hand, OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) And this starts in the seventh grade.  So I was teaching seventh-graders.  So I noticed that the women in my class -- this was in Oakland, California.  This isn't (ph) when I was in Berkeley.  And it seems the women in my class were suffering in the same way.  The girls in the class are suffering in the same way.  </p><p>      So I think it starts about that time.  There were definite roles that were assigned to boys and girls before I got there.  And they -- I'm not saying that I'm the intervention, but just to be clear.  But it was a summer program, and you didn't see these dramatic differences in women and girls speaking up and participating in problem-solving, and in public problem-solving.  So I think that it's much earlier than high school.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAYER</emphasis>:  But there are steps we can take then to counter those forces that may be present before we see our students.  All right. Thank you so much.  We have a 15-minute break.  At 10:30 our next speaker will begin.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DGM-DR31-JDPT-T05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Thank you, Janice, for the kind introduction. It's been a joy to work with you over the last 10 months. And thank you, Chair Yellen, for your insightful remarks, and your inspiring presence in our profession.</p><p/><p>It's an honor to work with all of you today in this room. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come together and think about the very important issue before us; diversity in the economics profession.</p><p/><p>I know and respect the work that many of you have done, and I am excited to map out a plan of action with you. The board, and in particular, Deputy Director Janice Shack-Marquez, and Director David Wilcox, have shown remarkable leadership in bringing us together today to open a profession-wide dialogue about diversity.</p><p/><p>The commitment displayed by all the officers I've met with here is invigorating and powerful. In this room we have these esteemed board staff, Federal Reserve Bank presidents and research directors, chairs of top economics departments from around the country, economists who have made significant contributions to understanding and addressing diversity, and leading scholars from other disciplines.</p><p/><p>We have the opportunity today to put our diverse heads together and produce lasting change in our profession. Echoing the chair's remarks, our objective is to create a profession that recruits and promotes the individuals best able to bring the energy, fresh insights and renewals, that our discipline needs to be healthy and thrive.</p><p/><p>Over the course of the day, we will hear from a dream team of speakers and panelists who will share their research and their work on the ground. I am truly excited to attend this conference. They will expose us to examples of successful diversity initiatives in economics and around academia.</p><p/><p>The presentations will help us understand the impediments to diversity and will, importantly, introduce us to evidence-based interventions we can support. Listen with the goal of developing a list of actions and initiatives that you believe hold promise as being practicable and effective.</p><p/><p>In the afternoon, we will have opportunities to share and refine our ideas through group discussions. By the end of the day, each of us should be able to identify several initiatives, large or small, which excite us.</p><p/><p>To make it concrete, set a personal goal of writing down two specific actions, one each of the personal and departmental levels, that you are willing to adopt to help our profession attract and develop the best people and best ideas. In my talk this morning, I will provide background information and a framework to organize and develop knowledge through the rest of the day.</p><p/><p>All right. So now I get to be a teacher rather than a speaker, much more practice at speaking. I want this to be an academic conference. I want us to converse. If you want to ask me questions during the presentation, feel free afterwards or in conversation later.</p><p/><p>All right. So my presentation has three parts. First, I present data on diversity in the profession. And in the next section, I briefly discuss possible consequences of having a more or less diverse profession.</p><p/><p>In the last section, I lay the groundwork for our plan of attack. I offer an economist's take on the diversity literature produced in a wide variety of fields, highlighting strands of diversity research that may be less familiar, and connecting them to the logic and research that we economists have done.</p><p/><p>First, a note on the meaning of the term \"diversity.\" While certainly other kinds of diversity are important and productive, our focus today is on groups that have been historically under-represented in our profession and in our country; women, African-Americans and Hispanics.</p><p/><p>The inclusion of people and perspectives from these groups is essential to the vitality of our profession and policymaking. But as we learn about the barriers faced by members of these groups, we develop general knowledge that is transferrable, facilitating the inclusion of the best people and the best ideas from all groups.</p><p/><p>Can you hear me if I step away from the mike? Good, all right. How are we doing? What are our numbers? Well, big tech firms have a reputation of being boys clubs. Yahoo -- all right, let's skip Yahoo for a moment. Google, Twitter, Apple, 70 percent of their workforces are male.</p><p/><p>What do you think our profession looks like? What percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors at colleges and universities in this country are female?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>Someone studied before the test.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>BAYER: True, true. All right. So there are my numbers, my cute graphic. All right. So calculated maybe slightly differently. But 22 percent in the most recent academic year are of tenured and tenure- track faculty are women.</p><p/><p>What about racial and ethnic minority, black or Hispanic economists? What percentage do you think that is? Ten? Oh, less than 10? Do I hear any others? Five.</p><p/><p>These numbers, by the way, are from the UAQ (ph). Some of you fill that out every year, some of you don't. So we do have a problem with response rate, missing data. But the numbers I calculate there are fairly consistent year to year, and across other surveys as well. So this is an accurate impression (inaudible) an accurate number.</p><p/><p>So maybe it's a legacy effect. Maybe over time we'll diversify a bit more. So let's get a sense of what the younger cohorts are showing.</p><p/><p>Looking at new Ph.D.s over the last three years, 33 percent are female. It's a pretty low number. And it does not compare well to other disciplines. What's happening in other fields is they're represented political science, 48 percent. Then (ph) Ph.D.s, 50 percent female.</p><p/><p>Generally, folks are surprised. Racially, we see a similar pattern. For new Ph.D.s, 8 percent of new Ph.D.s -- this is looking at U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- are black or Hispanic. If we include temporary residents, the total drops to 3 percent.</p><p/><p>In the other disciplines, 17 and 12 respectively across the political science and the STEM fields. \"STEM\" means science, technology, engineering and math.</p><p/><p>I'm sorry?</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>BAYER: Oh, sure, sure, sure. So if the numbers here -- 8 percent, 17 percent, 12 percent -- exclude new Ph.D.s by temporary residents, if we include those Ph.D. recipients, the numbers drop to 3 percent, 13 percent, and 8 percent. So we do have a high participation rate in our discipline of temporary residents in Ph.D. programs.</p><p/><p>So maybe even younger cohorts will save us. All right. So let's move back a stage in the pipeline and look at undergraduate students. Any guesses?</p><p/><p>Better. All right. So what do you think the number is for econ majors who are female? What percentage? Thirty to 40, yes. How do you think that compares to the other disciplines? Poorly? In a word, yes.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>BAYER: So depending on how inclusive we are when we consider what a STEM major is changes the numbers slightly, but not very much at all. So it is true physics, and slightly less diverse than we are in these dimensions, but not a whole lot less.</p><p/><p>And math, for instance, I think 48 percent of math majors are female. So we're behind. We're doing poorly. All right. Here, black and Hispanic econ majors constitute 12 percent; political science, 24; STEM, 20 percent.</p><p/><p>OK. Well, maybe this is not great, but getting better. No. Over the last 50 years almost, we see the proportion of econ majors who are female. We experienced a sharp increase in the '70s, but since have plateaued. There's really no reason to believe change will occur without distinct, intentional action on our parts. We see a similar message when we look at racial and ethnic diversity amongst undergraduate students. Economics is behind -- behind all majors, and specifically here, behind political science and STEM majors. And there's little upward trend.</p><p/><p>Convinced that it was worth the trip today? So far, so good, or so bad? So we have a problem. Does it matter? Yes, problems matter.</p><p/><p>We see data. Do they matter? What are the possible consequences of the numbers that we've seen, the lack of diversity in our discipline? Who are they? Who are these people?</p><p/><p>Nobeloriates (ph) in economics, 75 of them over the last 46 years. So what are some possible consequences? Just hypothesize, speculate. What are some possible consequences of (inaudible) economists?</p><p/><p>Not being as diverse as the rest of the population. Sure. Anybody? You don't see yourself there. What effect does that have on students?</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>BAYER: Eloquently said, and captures I think all three of these dimensions of consequence, or maybe six dimensions, right? The consequences of the lack of diversity in our profession are both inequity and inefficiency.</p><p/><p>It's not just about being nice to certain people, to include them in our fun work. But it's about getting efficient allocations through the people who join our profession in creating the body of knowledge we are responsible for expanding, and in making government policy.</p><p/><p>So around the academy, within economics and outside, researchers have been looking at the consequences of not diversifying groups. The consequences of homogeneity. And the research takes two strands.</p><p/><p>Well, of course we want to pull from 100 percent of the talent pool. That's a given. But it has consequences even beyond that issue. And I've kind of given you a couple representative papers within each strand.</p><p/><p>The first strand says diversity brings a greater range of insights and perspectives. If we have a broader group of people, we have a broader set of ideas.</p><p/><p>The second strand says there's something special about mixed groups. It changes group dynamics. The behavior of individuals is different depending on the composition of the group in which they're (inaudible).</p><p/><p>And yes, there are challenges to being a mixed group; in communication, maybe in trust. But there are also distinct benefits proved by laboratory research and on the ground. Some of the research has problems with looking for causation. But others very distinctly show that mixed groups are more successful in solving problems, especially complex problems, in part because the participants work harder, spend longer, prepare more, than in homogeneous groups.</p><p/><p>So I'd be happy to answer questions about any of these papers later. But at this point I'm trying to give a high-level overview and let you know that details exist.</p><p/><p>I want to show you details from one paper. You may know it. May, McGarvey and Weibels (ph) recently surveyed all AEA members with Ph.D.s working in the U.S., Ph.D.s from U.S. economic departments. Pretty similar group, except they disaggregated survey responses by gender.</p><p/><p>I've chosen four items. There were many, many items, most of which had distinct, statistically-significant differences in responses. Along the bottom, I showed statements. And the respondents were free to respond on a scale from one to five whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement.</p><p/><p>So for instance, you can see that women were 21 percentage points more likely to disagree with the statement that the U.S. has an excessive amount of government regulation of economic activity. Even more striking, my daughter said this is the only statistic I had to show all day.</p><p/><p>With the statement, \"Job opportunities for men and women in the U.S. are approximately equal,\" 58 percent of female economists disagreed with that statement, 16 percent of male economists...</p><p/><p>In questions about economic principles and theory, there was similarity amongst respondents, but disagreement on interpretation of economic outcomes, and on recommendations for policy work different, even after controlling these numbers, control for vintage of degree, place of employment, and so on.</p><p/><p>So we have a problem, that's the bad news. The good new is there's something we can do about it. What can we do? Well, we can patch the pipeline, or try. So this is a familiar analogy to those working not only in economics, but in many other disciplines, for thinking about what happens to people on their way to us.</p><p/><p>And they might start in high school or college, and move forward, and perhaps take a Ph.D. program, and perhaps complete it, and then perhaps go into the academy, and perhaps (inaudible) tenure-track job, and perhaps get tenure, and ultimately promotion. And there's been a lot of excellent research on that process, understanding why perhaps women and minorities leak out at higher rates than do others.</p><p/><p>There's been a lot of excellent work on initiatives designed to address those identified problems. But I think the framing of the issue as a pipeline causes us to think about the supply of people coming to us. We're sitting here, all settled in our profession, waiting for the supply to be delivered to us. And it takes attention away from what we could be doing. My students know, right? Solution to anything lies in supply and demand, right? There are two sides to every market, and we need to give more attention to the demand side of the market. That's a little scary, because when we think about labor-market discrimination, we think on the supply side there're human-capital attributes and others, and on the demand side, there's animus and statistical discrimination.</p><p/><p>And that indeed may be happening, but (inaudible) a lot more. We present an environment, and the people coming to us and through us are interacting with that environment. They're not acting in a vacuum. We have certain attitudes, beliefs, habits, culture, that we're presenting, and we need to reflect on, and perhaps improve.</p><p/><p>So here's some results from the literature on why women and members of under-represented minority groups may not be becoming economists at the rate that white men are. Each looked (inaudible), competitiveness, yada-yada-yada, role models. Begins to think about the dynamic between the identity of the students and the environment we present.</p><p/><p>But there are other ways we can examine the environment. And so in the rest of my talk, and perhaps in the rest of the day, you will hear about some of these other factors.</p><p/><p>So first, we can advance diversity by addressing implicit biases. Implicit biases happen without us knowing about it. Implicit biases are these automatic associations that we've been trained by society, and media, and others, to make.</p><p/><p>So a member from a particular group, we instantaneously associate with a particular attribute. It's outside our conscious awareness. So whereas animus-based and statistical discrimination characterize explicit conscious choices, we're talking about another kind of action, another kind of decision that -- almost every moment. Because every moment, we're bringing in, as the cognitive scientists estimate, 11 million bits of information, and we only have capacity to compute or deal with 40 bits.</p><p/><p>So these automatic associations take over. As you can see, this is linked to the literature now that we have been fruitfully incorporating into our work in the form of behavioral economics.</p><p/><p>So psychologists and others show that most of the population is no longer explicitly biased. At least responses to surveys will show respondents denying explicit biases, or revealing few explicit biases. But most of us are implicitly biased.</p><p/><p>So just like you might associate green with go and red with stop, we have these trained impulses. You can test yourself for your implicit associations by going to Implicit.Harvard.edu, and they have a wide variety of tests you can take. They're kind of fun. These are just a few of the tests available.</p><p/><p>Do you make an automatic association between women and not- science, or women and science? You can find out, along with many other tests. Note that psychologists rely on responses to these tests to measure an individual's degree of implicit bias in various dimensions and associations. But they also have other kinds of tests to measure implicit biases, where they hook subjects up to machines and measure heart rate and brain activity to identify when implicit biases or conflicts with implicit associations internalized have been identified.</p><p/><p>Where do implicit biases come from? I pulled this from January's meeting. Now many of you may not have noticed. I just had to make a big deal of it.</p><p/><p>So this is for our great job market. And we have two white hands shaking. One might be a female, because there are four buttons on the suit I guess. But the shirt doesn't look very female. At least it's adorned as a male, that hand is.</p><p/><p>So I don't know whether this reflects implicit biases, or just engenders them. But they're everywhere. And I want to say we are all implicitly biased. Research has shown that women are just as likely to be implicitly biased against other women as men are.</p><p/><p>So it's not about pointing fingers. It's about examining ourselves, and identifying where we might make associations that we don't want to be making, and then taking steps to de-bias. And there are distinct steps we can take.</p><p/><p>So there is oodles of experiments demonstrating implicit biases, and how they affect decisions. Again, I can give you the details later if you wish, but the professional decisions of physicians and police officers have been demonstrated to correlate with the implicit biases, and seem to be heavily influenced by implicit biases. Certainly, job market decisions of many types have been explored with the lens of implicit biases.</p><p/><p>And there are other results, which I think future speakers today will be discussing. So I'll move on, and just note that there are things we can do about it. You will see more explicit interventions later, I hope. But to give you a sense, note that economists have acknowledged the presence of implicit biases, and have thought of ways to address them.</p><p/><p>So Price and Wolfers looked at NBA referees. And because it's a snap judgment that a referee might make in the moment to decide whether to call a personal foul on a player or not, but to be generated by an implicit bias, rather than by some long, thought-out decision involving statistical or animus-based discrimination.</p><p/><p>And there was a pattern of behavior, a perverse pattern of behavior, where referees were less likely to call fouls on own-race players. This study got a lot of attention. And the referees want to do their job. They want to be impartial.</p><p/><p>And so then the economists went back and collected more data after the publicity storm, and the bias was gone. So that gives hope that there are things individuals can do to de-bias. Awareness is the first step.</p><p/><p>Other general strategies include time, clarity and accountability, where accountability is just the idea that after you make a decision, hold yourself accountable for it. Explain to yourself why you made that decision. Why did you (inaudible)? It wasn't just a feeling. You better have specific reasons you can tell yourself. That makes it a less-likely bias decision if you're going to have to do that in the future.</p><p/><p>And training. As I said, there are many steps, explicit evidence-based steps you can take to de-bias. The Bank of England is offering training on implicit bias to all of its officers. And as of two years ago, got through a third. And so I imagine they've completed the rounds.</p><p/><p>Second, we can advance diversity by being attentive to micro- inequities; the idea that in every interaction there is potential for unfair and inefficient treatment. It's not just at the formal gateways to our profession. It's not just when we are deciding whom to hire or interview, or which students to accept into our programs.</p><p/><p>But it's a day-to-day, moment-to-moment kind of interaction. We might have the opportunity to stop and chat with a student in the hall, or to respond in a constructive way, or a personal way to their comment in class.</p><p/><p>So recently, researchers conducted a field experiment in academia. The subjects were over 6,000 professors working in Ph.D. programs across all disciplines in top universities. And they got an e-mail. Each of these professors got an e-mail from a fictitious student.</p><p/><p>The student requested a meeting to occur in a week for 10 minutes to talk about the possibility of entering the program, specifically or in general. But the only thing that varied across females was the name of the student making the request. And the names were tested so that they were well identified with respect to their gender and race.</p><p/><p>The results, I think it's pretty impressive so many people responded to this anonymous student. But significantly, specifically significant differences in response rates, and in meeting-acceptance rates between white males and all the others.</p><p/><p>So it's not just Emily and Lakisha (ph) who are getting differences in treatments, it's our students. So a bit more detail, the lurid details of this investigation. Disaggregating by general category of discipline, you see business programs have the biggest discriminatory gap.</p><p/><p>So just so you can read the table, it indicates that 62 percent of women and minority students got a response, 25 percent more, totalling 87 percent of Caucasian males, received a response. We are down in the social-sciences group, which includes economics, plus 18 other disciplines, psychology, sociology, urban studies, criminology, area studies, gender studies, the like. So I begged, but I did not get data for economists from the researchers. So I respect that. But in a way, it doesn't matter. In a way, we should be attentive to micro-inequities and implicit biases, regardless of what group averages are.</p><p/><p>We need to -- we have the obligation and the power to examine our own behavior and improve it. And I'm talking to myself as much as to you. Please don't get me wrong.</p><p/><p>The researchers did find correlations. Higher-paid professions, private universities, were more likely to -- or had bigger gaps, discriminatory gaps. They also discovered that higher percentage females or minority disciplines had no bearing on the discriminatory gap.</p><p/><p>A woman contacting a woman, or a member of a particular racial and ethnic group contacting a professor of similar group, no bearing, except for I think Chinese males did benefit from contacting a Chinese professor. By the way, Chinese students were the most discriminated group in this group. But all racial and gender groups experienced discrimination for the most part, except Caucasian males.</p><p/><p>Next category, we can advance diversity by re-examining our rules and practices. So sometimes you see the advice, and it's not bad advice, that recognizing the role that implicit bias plays in our behavior, the solution is to make more rules. So there's less scope for our impulses to take over.</p><p/><p>But we better be darn careful about making those rules, because rules, and practices and habits can embody discrimination, racism, sexism themselves. So just like a facially, neutral practice like voter I.D. laws can have disparate effects on different groups. So, too, can our explicit and implicit rules.</p><p/><p>More a problem than a solution. But then I write, \"Rules have (ph) its practices and culture, have systematically and unintentionally advantaged or disadvantaged members of particular groups.\"</p><p/><p>So these are not only explicit rules, but implicit ones; rules of thumb we use. My favorite paper on the topic is by Ian Haney Lopez from the (inaudible) Journal in 2000. Of course, he was looking at whether the practice was legal under current statutes.</p><p/><p>But he found that grand jurors in L.A. county were at the time, I think, 5 or 6 percent Hispanic, whereas, the population was over 40 percent Hispanic. There is great disparity in who is making judgments on defendants, and who the defendants were.</p><p/><p>And there was lots of testimony by the judges whose job it was to appoint grand jurors. And they sincerely and, on the stand, said they did not intend to discriminate. But the effect was discrimination. And it was discovered that, you know, the rule of thumb for finding grand jurors was to use social networks so you could find people who would do good jobs, and take the position responsibly. But using that practice had the effect of creating disparity and disadvantage for members of certain groups.</p><p/><p>So we need to think about, in our own lives, what habits, or rules of thumb, or written rules we use to make decisions, and whether they too can be creating, unintentionally, disparities.</p><p/><p>Lastly, and this is kind of a living out, an attempt to live out recommendations from the other three points. We can advance diversity by changing the way we present economics to students.</p><p/><p>And I know not all of you are teachers here. But I want to introduce you to my project that Janice kindly mentioned earlier. It's called, \"Diversifying Economic Quality,\" short, Div-E-Q, which is an online resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics. It's a wiki, right?</p><p/><p>So people send me ideas. Of course, my students and I, and my colleagues, research and cover a lot of useful ideas, teaching tips to give professors and departments. But it's also a forum where we can exchange ideas as for how to improve our interactions with students, and our students' connections to our discipline.</p><p/><p>Because as you saw from the numbers, we have a problem at the undergraduate level. And I think there's something more we can do to attract a more diverse body of students to our very excellent discipline.</p><p/><p>So here are some ideas, the front page of the resource. I don't know if you can see it from where you're sitting, but I'll just read out a couple of points. It gives you tips for how to incorporate inquiry-based learning into your classes, how you could take an implicit association test to detect any implicit associations you might be making, how to offer wise criticism. I think a speaker later today will be talking about that, and so on.</p><p/><p>So there are large and small things you can find here. And we also present an assessment of the evidence. Some of these strategies have been documented as being better for students. They're evidence- based strategies, better for all students, and often particularly for students who are female or racial and ethnic minority. Members of under-represented groups do very well when we think carefully about how to make economics relevant to their lives.</p><p/><p>So here's a summary of my talk. We're not very diverse. Increasing our diversity would enhance efficiency and equity. And we can work on the demand side. We can change the environment we create. It gives us something to do, right? Not that we didn't have enough.</p><p/><p>But, you know, we have the power and the obligation to do all we can to address the system -- or situation. So those are the four points. And now I'd like to end with a guidepost for where we can go the rest of today, and in months ahead.</p><p/><p>You'll be getting more instruction and prompts throughout the day, just a way to organize productive conversation. But to get a mindset prepared, I really would like you to identify a partner right now, and exchange e-mail addresses, and commit to following up with your partner in January to see if you've actually done anything that you're potentially committing to do today.</p><p/><p>Second point, commit to do today at least one personal and one departmental initiative. And then of course, I think you've seen on the tables or elsewhere, we have a -- or the Fed, the board has put up an e-mail address. So (inaudible) now, or in months ahead, you can send questions or comments to the board, and we promise someone will read them and respond.</p><p/><p>So I'd love to take questions. But at this moment, find a partner and exchange contact information please.</p><p/><p>(ACTIVITY)</p><p/><p>I love the energy. So I want to make two notes, organizational notes. One is on each table there's a (inaudible) giving you the e- mail address, and a hashtag if you're a tweeting type. I know we used to (inaudible) who's tweeting out the conference. Others can as well.</p><p/><p>I am prepared to take questions now, or in private conversation later. Any questions pressing? Yes?</p><p/><p>All right. So there's a question. I'm sorry to like cut the flow of conversation. But I promise there'll be plenty of opportunities to talk more. I really like it.</p><p/><p>So the question is about this slide.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) So the first groups are more innovative and they're more successful, and solving problems. However, what research also shows is that these groups don't notice this themselves. So actually, when you ask more diverse groups in the lab after they have made these better performance, they think that they performed worse.</p><p/><p>And why do they think that they performed worse? They think so because they had a sort of unpleasant experience. There was more disagreement in the groups. There was more discussion. It took longer to reach this better decision. It took them longer. And it involved more energy from their side.</p><p/><p>And that is something I think we need to think a lot about. How can we make -- how can we make people like diversity? How can we make ourselves like diversity? How can we step out of that comfort zone? And I think it's, just as an important point to make here, as not only concluding that more diverse groups are more innovative and make better solutions, reach better solutions, but also that they don't notice. How can we make them notice?</p><p/><p>BAYER: Great. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Yes.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p/><p>BAYER: Sure. I'll post them. I think Janice said the board would be hosting -- OK. We'll work on it. OK.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) One of the things I do is I have students on their exams put their student I.D. numbers, not their names. A lot of people have probably tried that. I believe it works. But I've read a little about, heard a little about letters of recommendation bias.</p><p/><p>And one of the things my colleague from the psyche department taught me to do is to have a checklist for specific jobs. I always have a checklist of skills, regardless of the applicant's skills, that would be valuable to the employer, and make sure I go down the checklist. Because the data shows that faculty describe women much differently than they describe men.</p><p/><p>So just basic rules like that that are neutral can be quick to do, and make job easier.</p><p/><p>BAYER: Great. Thank you.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) It's important to have a separation of minority females from Caucasian females. So all your information provided was on females. Did you -- or did the people who did these different studies and research, did they separate it out to see if there is -- still a bias even more so that impacts minority females versus non?</p><p/><p>BAYER: So in reality, these intersections are really important. And the experiences of white women on average are different than for women in other racial and ethnic groups.</p><p/><p>So some of the studies I showed only did the gender dimension. Some did only racial or ethnic dimension. The one study on professors' response had enough observations that they could disaggregate by race and gender. That's a numbers problem that a lot of research has. So we have to kind of extrapolate what we learn by studying some dimensions of difference to what possibly might be going on in others.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I'm Donna Ginter (ph). I've done some work on women of color, science. And what we found is that the sort of binding constraint is more race than gender. And so if you have gender parity -- if you look at life science, 50 percent, or over 50 percent of Ph.D.s or in life sciences go to women.</p><p/><p>But if you look at women of color in life science, the race dimension that affects their success relative to the gender. And a colleague of mine calls this \"distance from privilege,\" in that white women are much closer to privilege, which we view as white men, compared with women of color.</p><p/><p>BAYER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I just wondered if you also have available to distribute a breakdown of the initial statistics you gave, that also show family income or resources in addition to race and gender, just to see what the breakdown is there as well? Because one of the barriers may also, in addition to race and gender, may have to do with income. And I'd just be curious to see how important that is. And it may not break any which way, but it'd be fun to see. BAYER: Right. So in that way, gender is a controlled experiment, because generally, the income backgrounds are the same across genders. Those particular data don't have the information associated with them. But I think there are studies. I could look them up for you.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I was just wondering -- I wish I knew. I was just wondering if anyone here knows essentially when these college majors are chosen? Sam and I were discussing it. Your statistics suggest that the problem exists already in college, so well before even graduate school, or things like that. And where are good times to intervene to assist, you know, in getting a more diverse group of students into economics?</p><p/><p>BAYER: So I know of interventions -- microphone's being passed. I know of interventions that start as early as high school. I think Jane Katz (ph) is in the room who does math.</p><p/><p>The board does math by econ. Is that how we say that out loud? And so the board has a program here, and in various reserve banks you might know about, to try to get I think under-represented groups more excited and knowledgeable about econ earlier.</p><p/><p>Most of the interventions -- we hear about some awesome interventions today. And most of them do take place I believe at later stages of the pipeline. There's the -- well, I think we'll hear about the summer program, which is for college students, and then the Div-E-Q that I do is at that level.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I have a paper coming out any day now about women in academic science careers. And we were looking specifically at mathematically-intensive fields, including economics. So we separated economics out from the rest of the social sciences.</p><p/><p>We have a figure in our paper that shows the number of Ph.D. students, percentage of Ph.D. students, female, and the average GOE (ph) quantitative score, and it's a downward sloping line. So you have economics, engineering and math, you know, the percentages of females are low, and the (inaudible) scores to get into graduate school are high.</p><p/><p>And one of the recommendations from our paper is it's math, and it's math that starts early, middle school and high school, because by the time they get to college, they may not even be able to take those college courses necessary to be successful in these mathematically- intensive fields.</p><p/><p>BAYER: Yes? We'll make this the last question. Thank you.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Just in relation to the question, so there's a recent -- it was like the previous issue of the SEJ (ph) has an article examining the role model type (inaudible) mainly. But they have a nice identification strategy, where they use visiting professors who are not -- or new professors that are not assigned when the students register, just to see whether gender matters. And so it doesn't seem that it matters then, which -- and it kind of suggests that it starts before the major declaration, and before college. So it's kind of disheartening to read that paper because of that, right? So maybe by the time that they get there, we're too late.</p><p/><p>BAYER: Well, I know of a paper that uses the random assignment of students to professors at West Point, I think Paige Carroll (ph), another author, looked at that and saw that while male students weren't affected by the gender, the professor -- female students definitely were, and majored in science, STEM fields, maybe even econ as a result of that early exposure to a role model.</p><p/><p>So there are things in the profession we can do. I'm -- I think we have so much more to learn. And with random assignment experiments producing so much information on the nature of the barriers, and the implicit bias, and whatnot, that exists in our environment, that we can really make progress, both in our research as economists, but also in our actions and procedures as economists.</p><p/><p>I said that was the last question. I see another hand, OK.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) And this starts in the seventh grade. So I was teaching seventh-graders. So I noticed that the women in my class -- this was in Oakland, California. This isn't (ph) when I was in Berkeley. And it seems the women in my class were suffering in the same way. The girls in the class are suffering in the same way.</p><p/><p>So I think it starts about that time. There were definite roles that were assigned to boys and girls before I got there. And they -- I'm not saying that I'm the intervention, but just to be clear. But it was a summer program, and you didn't see these dramatic differences in women and girls speaking up and participating in problem-solving, and in public problem-solving.

Continue reading A Manifesto: Using Empirical Research in Journalism and Scholarship to Understand Big Tech</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark Zuckerberg on stage at Facebook s F8 Conference, 2014. (Source: Flickr/Maurizio Pesce) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On April 22, Julia Angwin, an award-winning investigative journalist specializing in technology, was somewhat bizarrely fired as editor-in-chief from the fledgling media company she d founded. The company, The Markup, was created in order to focus on data-driven journalism, and in solidarity five members of the seven-person editorial team resigned as well. Shortly after, one of the leading and longest working reporters in privacy and technology, Kashmir Hill, was among those unceremoniously let go in a round of layoffs at tech publication Gizmodo as the site changed ownership.</p><p>Aside from the specific cost in new reporting and thoughtful projects, the loss of Angwin s and Hill s reporting even if it s only temporary should be a reminder of the power of their new brand of journalism to shape both the internal policies of technology companies and traditional government regulation. Theirs is a model that should not be confined to journalism but should be expanded into legal scholarship as well.</p><p>There are lots of ways to cover tech, but the past few decades have shown that the techniques most effective at moving law and policy forward take time. One of Angwin s most consequential pieces came together after a full three years of collecting data and asking subjects to test and report the advertising they were being shown by Facebook s algorithm. Angwin s reporting eventually revealed that Facebook was in fact letting advertisers exclude by race. It was a huge finding and resulted in a change in Facebook s policy going forward.  Facebook s changes to its ad targeting system are a huge win for civil rights,  wrote Angwin in a March 2019 Twitter thread explaining the long road it had taken to produce that work.</p><p>Similarly, Hill has spent days, weeks and months experimenting with surveillance technology. In 2018, Hill voluntarily wired her entire home with  smart  and surveillance technology for one month subjecting herself to everything from smart toothbrushes to a smart bed. Assisted by co-reporter Surya Mattu, Hill was able to demonstrate just how much information these devices conveyed to third parties without the consent of friends or family entering the home. A year later, Hill ran a different type of experiment, this time blocking Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple from her life each for a week at a time, and then all five at once. The project is currently up for a Webby, an award honoring  the best of the Internet.  As calls for antitrust measures continue to percolate, Hill s 2019 series has become one of the most widely heralded examples of the monopoly-esque power of big tech.</p><p>This reporting takes time. But even more importantly, it s characterized by a scientific rigor. This is what Angwin set out to base her entire investigative team around when she started The Markup. The adage goes that journalism is the first draft of history and as Angwin told me,  [I]t s our job to have the best possible draft of history.  Even after the collapse of The Markup, she aims to continue this effort by relying on the scientific method, which guides her reporting. This is easier with some more quantitative stories than it is with others, but she still believes in the importance of raising the bar.  One of the easiest ways we better journalism is just by increasing the sample size of journalism. The old adage used to be three quotes,  she laughed.  I think we can do a little bit better than that. </p><p>This kind of work is particularly necessary because technology companies are both opaque in their operation and incredibly powerful. Problems that arise from big tech be they in the wrong kind of content staying up, the wrong kind of content coming down, harassment, terrorism, algorithmic bias or fake news are not issues the public can start to address until they know what s going on.</p><p>The lessons from this style of tech reporting go beyond journalism. The legal academy is used to starting with an argument about where the law should go. From this viewpoint, the scientific method which moves only toward an argument if one is suggested by evidence can seem a strange beast. But it need not be. For years, legal scholars have been developing work that surveys the harms of technology and uses that evidence to argue for change. Danielle Citron has spent her career documenting the dark side of the internet, and most recently she and Benjamin Wittes have examined the harm done by bad Samaritans on the Internet to argue for reforming certain types of regulation. Mary Anne Franks has done similar work documenting nonconsensual pornography in working to try and put an end to it through new state and federal legislation. Ari Ezra Waldman has used interviews and primary source research within the privacy industry to demonstrate how current privacy laws fail to deliver on their promise to protect people. </p><p>But there is much, much more room for more descriptive work on what these large technology companies are actually doing to govern us, so that we can best know how to respond.  You can t solve a problem unless you precisely diagnose it,  says Angwin.  I see my job as trying to diagnose it.  This is where the pioneering journalism of Angwin and Hill can meet with that of existing legal scholars: The task for scholars is to learn new quantitative and qualitative empirical ways to see what tech is so that they can address the ways in which tech fails us as a society.</p><p>Right now, this approach is somewhat rare in legal scholarship, but it is not at all new. Among the categories of legal scholarship Martha Minow identifies in her famous essay,  Archetypal Legal Scholarship: A Field Guide,  are two that seem particularly apt for law and tech academia. These types of  [t]est[] a proposition about society ... that is used by lawyers or assumed in legal sources  through empirical investigation along with work that will  study, explain, and assess legal institutions, systems, or institutional actors  using  historical, anthropological, sociological or economic analysis  to expose complexity and  gaps between theories and practice.  It s just this type of work that can address the technology companies that govern the public.</p><p>Legal scholarship on big tech does not have to fit into one of Minow s categories, but often it naturally does. What s more, when it does, it can produce valuable results. In my 2018 article  The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,  I used dozens of interviews and primary source documents to argue that large online speech platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google were essentially systems of governance on our freedom of expression. For upcoming papers, I m embedding for weeks at a tech company to write a similar history and system explanation in the hopes that it will lead to better policy and regulation, and using large data sets to explore the phenomenon of virality.</p><p>This work is tiring, time consuming and expensive. (I had to fund my projects with grants, a rare thing for a legal academic.) But, like Hill s and Angwin s work, it also takes these companies out of the world of theory and into reality. We don t have to imagine what these companies are doing and what harms come at what benefits we can actually know. And knowing is where addressing the problems caused by big tech begins.</p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/manifesto-using-empirical-research-journalism-and-scholarship-understand-big-tech\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/manifesto-using-empirical-research-journalism-and-scholarship-understand-big-tech</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Kate Klonick<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/cybersecurity-newswire/\">Cybersecurity Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecom20190520amanifestousingempiricalresearchinjournalismandscholarshiptounderstandbigtech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W57-Y4X1-F08D-506B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><timeReceived>10:21 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
