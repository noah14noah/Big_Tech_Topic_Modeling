At the bar, they were greeted with a huge ice sculpture -- the Microsoft corporate logo in bold, slanted letters. Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) was there, too, boasting that Microsoft's Reston conference center \"reaffirms that Northern Virginia, especially Fairfax County, is the epicenter of the IT revolution.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Corporate bankruptcies and executive-level scandals may be mounting by the day, and some tech and telecommunications workers are still desperate to find work after being laid off in the last two years. But Microsoft's $25 million investment in Fairfax -- its first in Virginia -- illustrates another side of the Washington area economy.</p><p>Although the recovery is shaky, the regional economy is resilient enough that many companies such as Microsoft are still adding workers to their payrolls. There aren't as many jobs as during the robust times of the now-hollow dot-com boom of the late 1990s, but there are jobs nonetheless -- and often very well-paying ones.</p><p> Take the case at BAE Systems North America, a British defense and aerospace contractor. Company officials said they plan to hire 1,000 workers at their Reston offices over a three-year period; BAE has already hired 363 of them this year, with prospects for a similar number next year.</p><p> Another defense contractor, Northrop Grumman Corp., which has 20,000 workers throughout the Washington area, has hired about 1,400 people this year, with 500 additional hirings expected in Northern Virginia by the end of the year and 1,600 more next year if current business conditions continue.</p><p> Some non-technology companies, such as Fiducial, a French accounting, tax and business services firm in Columbia, are hiring. The company, which opened a regional and a national technical headquarters here last year, has 47 local employees and is recruiting for about 15 more, said William D. Morice, regional manager.</p><p> In some areas, such as Loudoun County, the number of job openings in the retail industry has increased. With the opening of Nordstrom at Dulles Town Center last month, 250 jobs were created.</p><p> Economists who follow the area's fortunes differ on the extent of the net job growth this year, if there will be any at all. They do agree that growth will be well below the annual average of 54,600 jobs for the last 20 years.</p><p> Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University, said he thinks the year as a whole will show a net increase of 9,000 jobs. That, he said, would be despite data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a loss in the number of area jobs when comparing the summer months this year with the same season in 2001. He predicted that about 15,000 jobs would be added in Northern Virginia and 1,000 jobs in the District but that suburban Maryland would lose 7,000 jobs.</p><p> By contrast, Anirban Basu, senior economist at Towson University near Baltimore, said the number for year-end job growth would be \"flat to slightly negative.\" Mark P. Vitner, who follows the Washington area economy as senior economist for the Charlotte-based Wachovia banking system, predicted a net of 27,200 jobs would be added this year.</p><p> \"The signals are really mixed about the economy,\" Fuller said. \"There's a lot of apparent bad news, and then there's some remarkable good news in the sense that the economy is a lot stronger than the traditional numbers point out.\"</p><p> Although federal government statistics show a drop in the number of jobs in the area, Fuller and Vitner said they think those reports are inaccurate because they do not count the self-employed, people at start-up companies or temporary workers who are doing contract work.</p><p> Fuller said that even as the official job growth inches ahead this year, the regional economy -- the value of the goods and services produced -- will grow at a 3.1 percent clip.</p><p> \"We're getting more work out of the same people,\" he said. \"We'll have an economy that looks pretty good but just not if you measure it by the jobs it's producing. Even though we're not booming, we're still growing.\"</p><p> Of the 51 metropolitan areas in the United States with a million or more people, Fuller said, the Washington area is the only one where the unemployment rate is below 4 percent.</p><p> Howard County's jobless rate in August remained at 3 percent, slightly up from 2.9 percent in August 2001. Howard's weekly wage, for companies based in the county, rose about 6 percent, from $729 to $772.50, the third highest in Maryland, according to recent data from the state Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.</p><p> Cheryl Queen, marketing manager of Howard's Office of Employment and Training, said people are not getting jobs as quickly as they used to. But she said her office is not seeing as many new out-of-work people coming in the door either.</p><p> Overall, said Vitner, the Washington region is better off than other areas with big tech sectors, largely because of substantial government contracting, especially as defense and homeland security efforts ramp up.</p><p> For managers of some companies, that translates into more jobs to offer.</p><p> David C. Karlgaard, president and chief executive of PEC Solutions Inc. in Fairfax, which designs technical systems for government agencies, said he expected the company's revenue to grow from $109 million last year to about $185 million this year. The result: 270 new hirings this year, chiefly electrical engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists, with more to come.</p><p> At Arrowhead Global Solutions Inc. in McLean, Chief Financial Officer Tom Reed said the 180-employee company has hired 80 workers this year, expects to hire an additional 40 by the end of the year and 80 more in 2003 if it wins new government contracts.</p><p> Other small companies say they are growing, too, with Cigital Inc., a Dulles software consulting and services firm, doubling from 50 to 100 workers this year and expecting to hire 60 next year.</p><p> How the additional jobs play out in the broader Washington area economy seems to be unpredictable.</p><p> \"I really like to be confident in my predictions,\" Basu said, \"but for the first time in 10 years I don't know what to say\" about 2003.</p><p> Ultimately, he suggested, the picture won't be a whole lot different than it is now -- continued slow growth nationally with slightly better prospects for the Washington area.</p><p>Staff writers Sabrina Jones and Amy Joyce contributed to this report.</p><p>Reported By TechNews.com, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.TechNews.com\">http://www.TechNews.com</url></p><p>(20021010/WIRES /)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSBYT2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YH-G7X0-00G8-P474-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">167445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1141\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Newsbytes</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Post-Newsweek Business Information, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>October 10, 2002, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0BAE SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0NOC (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>RESTON TOWN CENTER\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0BAE SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RESTON TOWN CENTER\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000461</classCode><className>DEFENSE CONTRACTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097YK</classCode><className>RECRUITMENT &amp;

The result: 270 new hirings this year, chiefly electrical engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists, with more to come. </p><p> At Arrowhead Global Solutions Inc. in McLean, Chief Financial Officer Tom Reed said the 180-employee company has hired 80 workers this year, expects to hire an additional 40 by the end of the year and 80 more in 2003 if it wins new government contracts. </p><p> Other small companies say they are growing, too, with Cigital Inc., a Dulles software consulting and services firm, doubling from 50 to 100 workers this year and expecting to hire 60 next year. </p><p> How the additional jobs play out in the broader Washington area economy seems to be unpredictable. </p><p> \"I really like to be confident in my predictions,\" Basu said, \"but for the first time in 10 years I don't know what to say\" about 2003. </p><p> Ultimately, he suggested, the picture won't be a whole lot different than it is now -- continued slow growth nationally with slightly better prospects for the Washington area. </p><p>Staff writers Sabrina Jones and Amy Joyce contributed to this report. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-101002HXJOBS10</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46YH-BR50-010F-93VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 The Washington Post</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>October 10, 2002 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001U2S</classCode><className>NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00027LJ</classCode><className>BAE SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS336611 SHIP BUILDING &amp;

Companies like Facebook, Google and many more help my family run our restaurant, connect with customers, and grow the business. However, the rhetoric in Columbus and Washington, D.C., about breaking up or changing the way these companies operate should concern every small-business owner in the Buckeye State.</p><p>Three generations of the Scaffidi family work together. Our goal is to run a local neighborhood restaurant serving homemade Italian food in a comfortable, relaxed environment. We aren\u2019t pretentious or fancy; nor are the ways we use digital technology.</p><p>We use Google Ads and we optimize keywords, so that customers find us in search results and in video ads on YouTube. Facebook and Instagram help us reach countless new customers in fun and engaging ways. We post pictures and videos of my grandmother and aunts making fresh pasta and homemade tomato sauce. When the weather is nice, we advertise our new outdoor patio. We spend only a few dollars, but we know quickly whether an advertisement is successful.</p><p>Digital platforms provide remarkable data and analytics that empower us to reach customers in ways we had never imagined a decade ago. For the first time, the platforms have made sophisticated marketing available to small businesses with even smaller budgets. Previously, small businesses advertised in the Yellow Pages and used coupon mailers and hoped that people would see their ads.</p><p>Our digital technology is so much more than advertising. Gmail and Google Docs cost very little, but they are essential to how we run our business and communicate with employees and customers. We use Quickbooks to manage the books, ADP for payroll, and Sling to help with employee scheduling. These tools are relatively inexpensive, and they enable our neighborhood restaurant to compete with franchises and chains that have million-dollar IT and advertising budgets.</p><p>However, we are concerned that this might not always be the case.</p><p>The Ohio Senate has held hearings about whether large internet companies are anticompetitive. Lawmakers may rewrite the laws to make it easier to break up tech companies, and Attorney General Dave Yost is part of an investigation into tech companies.</p><p>Do policymakers understand that if they force these companies to break up or change significantly, that would almost certainly mean fewer free or low-cost tools for small businesses? Advertising prices will skyrocket, tools like G Suite will get expensive, and countless small businesses will be punished.</p><p>There are so many industries where a few big players control more essential items than digital advertising \u2014 just think about health insurance, airlines and gas stations. Why isn\u2019t there an effort to break up these conglomerates or change the laws to improve opportunities for new airlines, insurance companies, or oil companies?</p><p>Digital platforms like Facebook and Google are not perfect. But for our restaurant, the good far outweighs the bad. Our elected officials, whose campaigns use lots of digital advertising, should know better than anyone that these tools are inexpensive, effective and essential. Elected officials know that regulating the digital economy will have consequences far beyond \u201cbig tech.\u201d They need to be sure that small businesses that rely on digital platforms are not collateral damage of these investigations or legislative efforts.</p><p>DiCarlantonio and his family operate the Scaffidi Restaurant Group in Steubenville, Ohio. DiCarlantonio also serves as the Jefferson County Democratic Party chairman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A screen shot from the Scaffidi restaurant Facebook page.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLEVPD-MERLIN_89267616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLEVPD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9N-RJ61-F08V-64WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) ratcheted up her anti-tech rhetoric in an interview Sunday with CNN. When asked whether Facebook should be broken up, she said, \"We have to seriously take a look at that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think that Facebook has experienced massive growth and has prioritized its growth over the best interests of its consumers, especially on the issue of privacy,\" she said.</p><p>The remarks come just days after Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the social network is a \"monopoly\" and should be forced to shed Instagram and WhatsApp - two blockbuster acquisitions from recent years.</p><p>That tough stance from such a high-ranking former Facebook insider threw fuel on a debate that's been growing in the Democratic Party since Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another 2020 candidate, issued a sweeping proposal to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google, which she said have \"bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a longtime ally to Silicon Valley, has himself grown increasingly critical of tech companies' power since declaring his run for the White House. But in an interview with ABC on Sunday, he made clear he is not a fan of Warren's plan, calling it reminiscent of something the current occupant of the Oval Office might say.</p><p>\"I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here,\" Booker said. \"It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, 'I'm going to break up you guys.'\"</p><p>Warren laid down the first major marker on tech and antitrust on the 2020 campaign trail in March, calling for Facebook, Google and Amazon to be designated as \"platform utilities\" and broken apart from their own services that compete on those platforms. </p><p>Since then, other 2020 Democrats have staked out an array of positions on whether to break up the tech giants, from offering full-throated support for that idea to issuing more moderate calls for greater scrutiny of the industry.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) praised Hughes, the Facebook co-founder, in a tweet Friday for \"sounding the alarm on the dangers of unchecked corporate power,\" writing, \"We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives - including our government. It's time to take that power back.\"</p><p>But Sanders stopped short of calling for the firm to be broken up. His office did not respond to a request for comment last week on his specific stance on that.</p><p>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), another progressive lawmaker running for the White House, expressed support for the Warren proposal, vowing to introduce \"similar legislation\" in the House. But most other 2020 hopefuls have been hesitant to fully embrace the breakup mantra, opting instead to call for investigations into possible anticompetitive behavior in the sector.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in March she wouldn't \"just come in and say break this up, break that up,\" but backed efforts to \"supercharge\" antitrust enforcement agencies and \"change the standards\" for what is considered anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, currently the Democratic front-runner in a number of 2020 polls, has yet to publicly weigh in on Warren's plan or on whether to break up firms like Facebook.</p><p>Democratic officials for years embraced liberal-leaning Silicon Valley executives as staunch political allies and donors, and celebrated the industry's rapid growth and expansion.</p><p>But the relationship has soured amid a litany of tech scandals over foreign election meddling on social media, data privacy and hate speech online, with many Democrats now openly calling for a new regulatory approach toward the sector.</p><p>Facebook has become a focus for much of the ire in Washington, with lawmakers of both parties calling for the company to be held accountable for a series of damaging privacy flaps. The social network is negotiating a potential record-setting settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which has been probing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. </p><p>On Sunday, Facebook's top policy executive, Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg, fired back at calls by Hughes and others to break up the firm. </p><p>\"I don't think dismantling companies is the way to deal with some of the complex issues which he quite rightly highlighted, data use, privacy, the attempt by folk from elsewhere to try and interfere in our elections,\" he told CNN. \"[C]hopping a great American success story into bits is not something that's going to make those problems go away.\"</p><p>Clegg has gone on the defensive in recent days, authoring his own New York Times op-ed over the weekend that argued that breaking up Facebook \"won't fix what's wrong with social media.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded the company along with Hughes, recently laid out a new \"privacy-oriented\" vision for the company, which includes an emphasis on encrypted communications. But skeptics, including Hughes, warn that the pivot could make it harder for regulators to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram, which Facebook plans to integrate more with its signature social network. </p><p>\"Until recently, WhatsApp and Instagram were administered as independent platforms inside the parent company, so that should make the process easier,\" Hughes wrote. \"But time is of the essence: Facebook is working quickly to integrate the three, which would make it harder for the F.T.C. to split them up.\"</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1317611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3B-PC61-JDJ6-K01T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><timeReceived>8:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 11, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Workers in blue coats stand in front of assembly lines and assemble the Mac Pro, a $6,000 luxury computer. One afternoon in November, Apple CEO Tim Cook gives US President Donald Trump a guided tour of the plant - after all, it's a showcase factory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"This is a very special day for me,\" says Trump, as can be heard on video recordings. He often predicted that one day Apple would manufacture in the USA, not in China. \"And that,\" Trump continues, \"happened now.\" Later he adds: \"Today, I opened a large Apple factory that brings jobs to America. \"</p><p>In fact, the work was not inaugurated that afternoon. It's been in operation for six years. And the Mac Pro is also the only major Apple device produced in the U.S., all others come from China.</p><p>So what Trump said in the factory was untrue, once again, but the really remarkable thing is that Cook let him. The manager spoke shortly after Trump, without correcting the false statement. The scene gives an insight into the relationship between the two men. And it's a symbol of how America's tech giants try to come to terms with Trump.</p><p>How Silicon Valley, for a long time on the side of the American left, now wants to be on good terms with the Republicans. Apple, Facebook, Google, they all, it seems, ingratiate themselves with Trump. Only Amazon, the Jeff Bezos group, does not participate.</p><p>Cook, the Apple boss, often criticised Trump in the past, for example for his tough policy towards immigrants. But for some time now he's been trying to improve his relationship with the president. The two last met regularly for dinner, Trump even calls Cook a friend in the meantime.</p><p>Cook also sits on a White House advisory board. And now he offered Trump a stage in the Texas factory to praise himself and attack his opponents. During the visit, Trump described the Democrats who wanted to remove him from office as \"incompetent\" and \"liars \". Cook stood next to it, mute.</p><p>Why did he let his factory become the backdrop for such a performance? It could have something to do with Trump announcing new tariffs against China on 15 December - the country where Apple's most important product, the iPhone, is being created. Mobile phones account for more than half of Group sales. Cook hopes that it will be exempted from customs duties. \"We'll take a look,\" Trump said at the Apple plant.</p><p>Cook's not the only CEO who dines with Trump. In October, the President also received Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, at the White House. Zuckerberg came with Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter who sits on the supervisory board of the online network. Around this time, Facebook made a decision that Trump should be happy about.</p><p>The company announced that political advertising would not be checked for correctness and that nothing would be done if politicians disseminated false information. In other words, you will be able to lie freely on Facebook in the 2020 election campaign. The Democrats criticize that this regulation helps Trump above all.</p><p>Google also recently angered the Democrats. The search engine refused to delete an advertising video that defamed Joe Biden. Biden, once vice-president under Barack Obama, will run in Democratic primary elections and wants to defeat Trump next year. The half-minute spot is about the Ukraine affair. Biden is accused of corruption in the film.</p><p>Google later announced that it would regulate political ads more strictly in the future, which in turn annoyed Trump. The company decided that individual user groups should only be addressed in the upcoming election campaign according to three characteristics: Age, sex and postcode. This will not allow people to display targeted advertising based on their political attitudes. Whether someone is rather left or right is no longer visible to campaign managers of the parties.</p><p>Apple and Facebook, it seems, are turning away from the Democrats and heading for Trump, while Google is probably looking for a middle way. All three were previously considered friends of the democrats, a bastion of progressives. What's the matter?</p><p>One reason could be that Democrats are planning to end the dominance of Internet giants. \"Break up Big Tech,\" for example, repeatedly demands the candidate Elizabeth Warren, \"smashes the tech giants. \"</p><p>The senator from Massachusetts wants to split Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon into many individual companies, just as America once did with John Rockefeller's oil empire. Not all democrats are as radical as Warren. But it is considered certain that everyone wants at least to regulate the industry more.</p><p>Only one tech giant, it seems, is not impressed by all this and keeps his distance from Trump: Amazon. The president is on the online merchant not speak well. He dislikes the critical coverage of the Washington Post, which belongs to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Recently Trump called the entrepreneur in a tweet \"Jeff Bozo\" - Bozo was a famous TV clown in America in the 1960s. Previously, Bezos offered the president to shoot him into space with a rocket from his space company Blue Origin. The two men - one among the richest in the world, the other among the most powerful - have been having a feud for years.</p><p>And Amazon is feeling it. Last month, the Pentagon awarded a billion-dollar contract and the company passed over. Instead, they closed the deal with Microsoft. The company is to modernize the military's information technology and set up clouds. The project is called Jedi and stands for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.</p><p>Amazon is taking legal action against the decision of the US Department of Defense. According to the company, there was an 'unmistakable bias' in the award procedure. Is this revenge Trumps, is this what the consequences look like when you alienate the president?</p><p>The managers of the other tech companies may be ensnaring Trump - but their employees are more likely to see it as Bezos. Most continue to support the Democrats. Silicon Valley donates as much money to no one as it does to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Google employees transferred more than 130,000 dollars to Warren so far, Sanders received more than 115,000 dollars, as data show the Washington organization Center for Responsive Politics. Apple employees gave Warren $45,000 and Sanders $65,000. For visitors to the Texan factory, on the other hand, hardly any of them donate. Donald Trump is not very popular in Tim Cook's company. So the programmers, designers and workers in the blue coats might have been displeased that their boss let the president swear at the Democrats between assembly lines full of Mac Pros.</p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20191202DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTP663BM021TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Apple boss Tim Cook (l.) with US President Trump</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-167240829</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMV-XMV1-DY2B-S113-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg. 281</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 2, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

A newly proposed privacy law could see key executives like Mark Zuckerberg answer directly and even do jail time. Regulators believe this may be the only way to keep companies from applying Mark Zuckerberg's \"move fast and break things\" principle. </p><p>When Mark Zuckerberg publicly asked governments to regulate tech firms[1], he probably didn't have personal accountability in mind. For all the talk about a more privacy-focused Facebook[2], the CEO has little to show for it. The most recent development has been a meeting[3] with several White House officials to discuss internet regulation and antitrust issues. However, when pressed by senators on the issues of privacy, he offered vague responses that the company is still in the process of figuring that out. Now, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden is pushing for regulation that could hold tech company executives personally responsible for failing to protect user privacy and security on their respective platforms. The new privacy bill is suggestively called the \"Mind Your Own Business Act[4],\" and builds on top of a previous draft[5] from last year.If it passes, the new legislation would give the Federal Trade Commission more effective tools to battle tech giants that violate data privacy laws. Specifically, it would give it the authority to set minimum privacy and security standards that companies have to follow, and to issue heavier fines of up to four percent of annual revenue on the first offense.This comes after the FTC was criticized for the relatively mild punishments applied to companies like Facebook[6], Equifax[7], and YouTube[8]. In the case of Facebook, the result of the $5 billion fine was that the value of the company increased[9] by $10 billion, which is arguably not how punishment is supposed to work.For executives that knowingly lie to the FTC, there would be harsh punishments - between 10 and 20 years of jail time. Their companies would also be forced to pay a tax based on their salary. Wyden said in a statement that \"Mark Zuckerberg won't take Americans' privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences.\" Wyden also believes the bill at the very least would provide the same protections as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Consumers could get a one-click way to opt out of sharing their personal information and companies would have to offer clear explanations of how they use and share that information.For companies that own social platforms like Twitter and Facebook, they would have to provide \"privacy-friendly\" versions of their services for a reasonable fee. The bill would also extend the FCC's Lifeline program to ensure those privacy-focused versions would also be accessible to low-income consumers.As with previous privacy bills that have been proposed over the last few years, the Mind Your Own Business Act has to gain bipartisan support. It's worth noting that Wyden's bill would not preempt states from making their own privacy regulations, so there's one less source of conflict to worry about.

For all the talk about a more privacy-focused Facebook, the CEO has little to show for it. The most recent development has been a meeting with several White House officials to discuss internet regulation and antitrust issues. However, when pressed by senators on the issues of privacy, he offered vague responses that the company is still in the process of figuring that out.</p><p><br/>Now, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden is pushing for regulation that could hold tech company executives personally responsible for failing to protect user privacy and security on their respective platforms. The new privacy bill is suggestively called the \"Mind Your Own Business Act,\" and builds on top of a previous draft from last year.<br/>If it passes, the new legislation would give the Federal Trade Commission more effective tools to battle tech giants that violate data privacy laws. Specifically, it would give it the authority to set minimum privacy and security standards that companies have to follow, and to issue heavier fines of up to four percent of annual revenue on the first offense.<br/>This comes after the FTC was criticized for the relatively mild punishments applied to companies like Facebook, Equifax, and YouTube. In the case of Facebook, the result of the $5 billion fine was that the value of the company increased by $10 billion, which is arguably not how punishment is supposed to work.<br/>For executives that knowingly lie to the FTC, there would be harsh punishments - between 10 and 20 years of jail time. Their companies would also be forced to pay a tax based on their salary. Wyden said in a statement that \"Mark Zuckerberg won't take Americans' privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences.\"<br/>Wyden also believes the bill at the very least would provide the same protections as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Consumers could get a one-click way to opt out of sharing their personal information and companies would have to offer clear explanations of how they use and share that information.<br/>For companies that own social platforms like Twitter and Facebook, they would have to provide \"privacy-friendly\" versions of their services for a reasonable fee. The bill would also extend the FCC's Lifeline program to ensure those privacy-focused versions would also be accessible to low-income consumers.<br/>As with previous privacy bills that have been proposed over the last few years, the Mind Your Own Business Act has to gain bipartisan support. It's worth noting that Wyden's bill would not preempt states from making their own privacy regulations, so there's one less source of conflict to worry about.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-255081</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFB-6YG1-DYDW-7484-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

California is already trying to protect user privacy. And in Maine, there's a new law that aims to restore the protections that were rolled back by the Trump administration and Congress. Steve Mistler from Maine Public Radio reports.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE MISTLER:                 Your Internet service provider, whether it's a broadband provider at home or the telecoms that connect your phone to the Web, can see almost all of the unencrypted information that you share while using the Internet. Gigi Sohn is a fellow at Georgetown Law.             </p><p>GIGI SOHN:                 And sees every email that crosses its pipes. It sees everything.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 Everything. Your browsing history, which apps you use, the location of your mobile device. Sohn is also a former attorney for the Obama-era Federal Communications Commission that drafted the 2016 privacy rule that would have barred Internet service providers, commonly called ISPs, from selling all that personal data without your consent. But that data are valuable to the ISPs, which can sell it to companies for highly targeted advertising.             </p><p>GIGI SOHN:                 So it's not exactly a secret here about who doesn't like these broadband privacy rules.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 Two years ago, the industry convinced the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump to overturn the privacy rules. And that's how Sohn this spring ended up testifying before the Maine legislature in an attempt to secure privacy regulations for ISPs operating in the state.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>GIGI SOHN:                 When the federal government stands down, the state government should stand up.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 Democratic State Senator Shenna Bellows tried that two years ago, but the bill failed. With a new legislature, she tried again this year.             </p><p>SHENNA BELLOWS:                 Everything you do online goes through your Internet service provider. And that's why it's so important. They should not be profiting off your personal information.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 Large ISPs and attorneys from trade groups, like the Internet and Television Association, argued that the bill unfairly targeted ISPs while excluding so-called edge providers, like Google and Facebook.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF AD)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 (As narrator) Yet some Maine politicians want to exempt Facebook, Google and thousands of other Internet companies from new privacy legislation.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 The Maine State Chamber of Commerce spent thousands of dollars on digital ads like that one, buying space on websites like Facebook. Senator Bellows, the bill's sponsor, says there's a big difference between regulating ISPs and edge providers, mainly that you can't get to sites like Google and Facebook without ISPs, the on-ramp to the Internet.             </p><p>SHENNA BELLOWS:                 Additionally, Facebook and Google are free services that you pay for with your privacy. Your Internet service provider charges you a lot of money for that access to the Internet.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Maine legislature before Democratic Governor Janet Mills signed into law what privacy advocates say is the toughest in all 50 states. Consumers don't have to ask ISPs not to sell their data. The burden is on the ISPs to ask customers for permission, going a step further than a new law in California. Charter Communications, one of the largest ISPs in the country, declined a request for an interview and issued a statement saying the Maine proposal is deeply flawed because it could lead to a patchwork of state regulations. But Gigi Sohn, who watched as ISPs spent millions of dollars overturning the federal privacy rule, is unsympathetic and hopes other states follow Maine's lead.             </p><p>GIGI SOHN:                 And don't push Humpty Dumpty off the wall and then complain when he breaks into 50 pieces.             </p><p>STEVE MISTLER:                 And, barring a lawsuit by the ISPs, at least one part of Humpty Dumpty will go back up on the wall on July 1 of next year, when the Maine law takes effect.

With governments across the world dealing with the threat in their own countries, are we entering a world where national self-interest is the new normal? As the Soviet Union began to stutter at the end of the 1980s, political philosopher Francis Fukuyama described 'The End of History', presuming Western liberal democracy would triumph in a final, unipolar post-Cold War epoch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet since then, we have seen at least three major crises shaking the foundations of this creaking system. Firstly, US advocates of the 'Democratic Peace' theory - believing 'regime' change in totalitarian states would democratise them into malleable trading partners - experienced a rude awakening when Al Qaeda attacked their country on 9/11 in 2001. Subsequent military intervention preceded chaos, poverty and mass migration from the Middle East to Europe.</p><p>Secondly, the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-2008 led to developed economies closing banks and triggering 'quantitative easing' as their central banks tapped reserves to buy bonds. \"As the commercial paper market froze and liquidity vanished, the world's capitalist system and financial markets came within a hair's breadth of imploding,\" recalls Malik Sarwar, CEO of K2 Leaders.</p><p>The latest Covid-19 crisis combines a global health emergency with mass unemployment and business losses, as economic activity grinds to a standstill, leaving this shaky liberal Western model, already tested by populist leaders in several countries, once more in a vulnerable state.</p><p>While the 25 per cent Wall Street Crash of 1929 was followed by the Great Depression of the 1930s and an eventual war between two repugnant, brutal dictators leading the Communist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, the 2008 experience was very different.</p><p>Just five months after Lehman Brothers closed, markets took off again, as debts spiralled. The $150tn of global debt which helped trigger the GFC in 2008 took 100 years to accumulate, comments Amin Rajan, CEO of the CREATE financial research consultancy. \"But the problems that caused the GFC have not gone away; they've got worse. Central banks have been spending money like drunken sailors and even buying junk bonds.\"</p><p>The current crisis will be deeper and longer. Previously we had joined-up thinking between national neighbours during the GFC. After World War II, world leaders built transnational institutions such as the IMF and European Economic Community, turning crisis into opportunity. The trend today is in the opposite direction.</p><p>US president Donald Trump talks down uniting efforts of the World Health Organization, the UN and NATO, attempting to destroy the old order, alongside the UK prime minister's European withdrawal mission.</p><p>Each leader, including the onceunifying figure of Germany's Angela Merkel, has retreated to supervising responses in their own countries, with \"nobody raising a finger\" to help a near-bankrupt Italy, says Mr Rajan.</p><p>While the Western neo-liberal model has not yet died, the rampant inequality it has generated during the last 20 years in its US and European Wealth Tech Awards Many thanks to all the banks that took part in the third annual Wealth Tech Awards.

Moreover, pension systems are being driven into deeper deficits by falling asset values and rising liabilities, turning into legalised Ponzi schemes.</p><p>But all is not yet lost. The GFC of 2008 served as a dress rehearsal for Covid-19, as the 'firemen' - central bankers, politicians and leaders of multilateral institutions - realised immediately they would have to act quickly to mobilise vast resources.</p><p>\"They had to bridge the balance sheet gaps of firms and consumers and to mitigate the huge blow to employment and lost demand,\" says Didier Duret, a former ABN Amro private banker, who now runs the Futuring Strategies family office advisory firm.</p><p>The governance of international organisations such as the WHO may be called into further question and the IMF's controversial debt restructuring role could leave developing nations even further behind.</p><p>But new, powerful players will surface from the chaos, says Mr Duret. Educational institutions such as Johns Hopkins University in the US will give more credibility to independent experts, previously trashed as bearers of \"fake news\" by US and UK leaders.</p><p>Additionally, a new form of multilateralism will deal with infotech dominance, cybersecurity and cyberwar, preventing a \"digital pandemic\" in the making. \"Fragilities, power struggles and concentrations can combine to create a huge systemic, high-tech crisis,\" believes Mr Duret.</p><p>New digital business ideas finessed against this backdrop are likely to permanently change our lives. The big tech giants from China rose to prominence in 2008, after springing from the dotcom disaster. Now the likes of Alibaba smell another opportunity to launch low-cost money management products.</p><p>Alongside these, we can expect new models of asset management, predicts Mr Rajan, where investment firms pay clients to manage their funds. They must first prove their ESG credentials and ability to manage assets in volatile periods. A focus on quality stocks, displaying sensible, moral governance and transparent management will also result.</p><p>In the realm of electronic payments, the impetus is also coming from China, whose central bank is pushing ahead with digital currency trials across four major cities, in the belief that most of us are unlikely to want to handle paper money after the crisis.</p><p>\"Empty toilet paper racks will refill, but fully encrypted, traceable currency that is virtually impossible to counterfeit? That's here to stay,\" says Charles Chang, deputy dean of the Fanhai School of Finance at Shanghai's Fudan University.</p><p>While few believe capitalism and liberal democracy should similarly be confined to the history books, the damaging trend towards nationalism is likely to continue, in China as well as Western nations.</p><p>Supply chains for medicines and high-tech items are likely to become less international and more domestic, with air travel and tourism also hit. Our greatest fear as a global society is for the flow of ideas between different nations to be restricted as a result, taking us back to a new Cold War era. As Fudan University's Mr Chang suggests: \"If we allow this nationalism to spread to the core conduits for thought-sharing like education and cultural exchange, that would be the real backward step.\"</p><p>Published by: Financial Times Ltd, Bracken House, 1 Friday Street, London EC4M 9BT +44 (0)20 7873 3000 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pwmnet.com\">www.pwmnet.com</url> Staff members can be contacted by dialing +44 (0)20 7775 followed by their extension number.</p><p>Editor-in-Chief Yuri Bender 6376 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yuri.bender@ft.com\">yuri.bender@ft.com</email> Deputy Editor Elisa Trovato 6374 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elisa.trovato@ft.com\">elisa.trovato@ft.com</email> Chief Sub-Editor Elliot Smither 6379 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elliot.smither@ft.com\">elliot.smither@ft.com</email> Contributors Jenny Kvaskova Arndt Mielisch Michael O'Sullivan Malik S.

The president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like the president did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamed back in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course. Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the off-stage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until a final text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on America's tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, highstandard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range of drugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general.</p><p>The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>\"The current IP provisions are terribly concerning,\" said Patrick Searle, spokesman for the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), an assembly of fast-growing tech companies. \"The most important thing to remember in these NAFTA negotiations is that Canada has virtually no IP stocks,\" Searle said, referring to the value of IP owned by Canadian entities.</p><p>\"Stronger and longer IP protections entrench and extend pre-existing IP holders.\"</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is blatantly protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for American firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented this week, but not all. Trudeau's choices will show the extent to which he favours established industries over next generation ones. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

We'll explore that. In the meantime, here comes The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Marie Harf, and Lawrence Jones. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. We are waiting for an update from the FBI on the investigation into the death of George Floyd. It comes after a violent protest rocking the city in Minneapolis over the death of a black man in police custody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mayor calling for the National Guard and pleading for peace after a night of fires, looting, and confrontations with police, disturbing video shows a police officer pinning Floyd's neck to the pavement before he died. President Trump weighing in, calling video shocking and ordering an expedited federal investigation into George Floyd's death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four officers involved have been fired but have not been charged at this time. The Minneapolis mayor and many others saying they should be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not a prosecutor but let me be clear. The arresting officer killed someone. He would be alive today if he were white. The facts that I've seen, which are minimal, certainly lead me down the path that race was involved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: George Floyd's brother also calling for action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These officers, they need to be arrested right now. They need to be arrested and held accountable about everything, because these people want justice right now, justice. If these guys were arrested, convicted of murder and given the death penalty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: And we are awaiting this press conference from the FBI on this very case. And I also wanted to point this out that George Floyd's girlfriend, her name is Courtney Ross, she had a statement she put out saying that about the unrest in the writing. She said I am heartbroken, waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd.</p><p>He loved the city. He came here for the people and opportunities. He was about love and peace. And she said she wants demonstrators to know that I understand their frustration, but I want people to protest in a peaceful way.</p><p>So, we will take it or on the table. Lawrence Jones, let me start, we spoke earlier today. As night comes to Minneapolis, they are bracing for another night of these riots, your thoughts.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: As I told you on your program earlier, a lot of times as someone who's been on the ground reporting on these protests when a tragedy like this happens, reports come out afterwards. And you see that the majority of the people that set things on fire aren't from those neighborhoods. They are outside people. They're Antifa.</p><p>It's not the community that is mourning. I hope that they are there to announce charges. This happened Monday. It's Thursday. If this was a cop that was brutally murdered and there were people who student watched it happen, they would be in jail right now and there would be no bail. And I think it's important that when we are having this conversation, to take the city in context.</p><p>This city has gone through this before. They have been sued by police officers, and their departments before because of racism. One of those people that sued them is the current chief of police. The union rep that is in that police department was seen by the police chief now with a white power sign on his jacket.</p><p>And so, when you see people upset, they are upset because of the pattern. You know me, this audience knows me. I wait for the facts on most things. I've been an investigator. I've spent a career in criminal justice. My first job was working in juvenile court. But I'm also a black man. And this could have been me. And so, when you see people like me who are conservatives, when you see someone like Tim Scott, the first black Republican senator since reconstruction saying I've been pulled over in the Capital seven times.</p><p>And the cop tells me the senate pin I recognize but your face I don't recognize. This is why you see outrage in this country. And just to piggyback on what's going on in the country during the pandemic, there are a lot of conservatives now asking questions about the state. You have seen members of the state abuse their power.</p><p>And now, they're saying maybe what's happening in the black community, maybe they weren't lying all along. Now, of course there are people in the media and on the left to take advantage of these tragedies, but you know me. I'm not one of those type of people.</p><p>PERINO: No. You're a great person. We are so glad to have you here today, Lawrence. Greg, since Monday, since this has happened, even though the country is -- there's a lot of division, a lot of polarization. There was near universal, almost universal agreement that these investigators, the police officers should absolutely be investigated. That wasn't in question.</p><p>Then when a protest, a peaceful protest crosses a line into a riot, and you see a situation where you have a target being looted, an AutoZone up in flames. A low-income apartment building that was underway cop inflames me think about the people are going to have to wait to get their jobs back. I'm sure the state is on edge already because of the virus. It's a real unfortunate thing. There is universal agreement.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. There's two important parts of your question. Number one, we feel like we have to be in two boxes, two prisons. You either believe that police brutality exists, or you are repulsed by looting. In fact, you can agree with both of those. You don't have to be in one box or the other.</p><p>The fact is you can be absolutely disgusted by what happened to that young man in that video. You could also be repulsed by what you're seeing right now, this ridiculously absurd video from last night. I'm also wondering why there are certain people who are silent about this behavior, as though it comes down to be expected. What does that say about you if you just expect this kind of behavior?</p><p>What does that say about how you feel about minorities? To your point, the universal agreement, if you strip away the media's framing, you will find that mostly everybody agrees on the basic things, Coronavirus. We all want to beat this virus and get back to living healthy, economy. We want to get back to work safely and not go crazy.</p><p>We are against police brutality and we want justice for whatever happened. And we find looting repugnant. No one would disagree with any of that. It goes back to your question. What are you riding against? What did target do to you? What did low-income housing do to you? We are all in agreement here, which makes the rioting and the looting seem opportunistic.</p><p>PERINO: And George Floyd's girlfriend, Jesse, saying he would've wanted the protest to be peaceful. He wouldn't have wanted to see this. I don't know if that message will land on any ears over there.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: You don't need to swipe a flat screen TV to avenge this guy's death. That's were so many people have so much compassion for this community, and they see these images on the screen. And they lose a little bit of that. Even I can understand rioting or protesting the police. Of course, this police officer looks like he killed a guy.</p><p>So, yes, get out in the streets. Get out there and show how angry you are, how much pain you're feeling. But then when you start slipping into stores and stealing cell phones and electronics, I don't know. This is what divides the country. Because you have the media, and I'm not comparing these two protests. You have the media. You had a protest last week over a lockdown, totally peaceful.</p><p>People are losing their civil liberties, their jobs and their livelihood, their rights. They are out there peacefully protesting, and they are just getting smeared by the media. And then you have other people protesting rightfully over a dead man, and they start lighting things on fire. You don't -- you hear nothing about that.</p><p>It is apples and oranges, I get it. There are reasons for people to be on the streets. I understand that. But that hypocrisy is sad and everyone agrees, yes, Lawrence. This cop was a bad apple. He had complaints, multiple deadly incidents on his record. A history problem there in that department but looting and setting things on fire is going to mend fences. That's only going to make things worse.</p><p>PERINO: Marie, maybe you can help us understand what the FBI and state and city officials, when they come to the podium, they are about an hour late getting to the press conference. You are a great communicator, of course, by trade. What do you think they could do or say tonight that would maybe help quell the rioting?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS HOST: Charges, as Lawrence started off with, charges against these police officers. Not just that they have already been fired but that they are charged with murder. And what's been so interesting to me, Dana, is even a few years ago when we saw the Trayvon Martin situation or Eric Garner, you did not see police chiefs from across the country coming out in support of the victims. You saw silence for the most part.</p><p>Just this week, we have seen police officers, police chiefs across this country who worked so hard to repair relationships in their own communities. These police officers don't represent us. We are better than this. That's a sea change I think is really important in the public narrative across the country. That's one very small hopeful sign that we've seen in this horrible tragedy.</p><p>PERINO: Marie, that's an excellent point. I heard from a police chief who said today when he saw all that great work they've been doing that community is at risk. They've been trying to build trust. President Trump makes good on his threat against Twitter. You will hear from him next.</p><p>WATTERS: President Trump upping the ante in his feud with Twitter. Trump just signed an executive order calling for regulations to punish social media companies for political bias. He also took a big shot at Twitter over fact-checking his tweets. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think if Twitter were not honorable, you'd have a guy like this be a judge and jury. I think you shut it down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would you set it down?</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know. I have to ask the lawyers. If it would be able to legally be shut down, I would do it. I think I would be hurting it very badly if we didn't use it anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Twitter is defending its decision. But Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, ripped the move, telling Dana that social media platforms should not be the arbiters of truth. OK, a lot to take in here. Dana, when you talked to Zuckerberg earlier, what was the sense? Was it him needling a competitor?</p><p>PERINO: I think they are rivals, of course. They get lumped together in terms of big tech. And I think one of the things that Zuckerberg was trying to say is that we have a different approach. And if Twitter wants to do it, it's OK. But he did say he thought Twitter made a mistake and that he doesn't think the big tech companies, if you're going to be a platform, just be a platform and don't weigh in.</p><p>And one of the things that's lost in this discussion is just how much the left really disdains the social media companies, especially Facebook, because Facebook made that decision that it wouldn't weigh in on political speech. Speaker Pelosi today ripped Mark Zuckerberg. They have been taking it on the chin, even Joe Biden, things that they should take down President Trump's campaign ads or posts or speech, his tweets that are cross promoted on Facebook.</p><p>So this is in some ways what President Trump is doing, you could maybe see there would be some bipartisan support but for very different reasons. They both hate it. I think it's a slippery slope for conservatives. I know the communications act of 1996, it's 25 years old and may be a does need a little bit of updating. But I also think that these companies don't have that protection, censoring will be a much more likely thing because they will be liable for all sorts of things. It's probably better to let it all go.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm not so sure about that. I think you could maybe target the regulation a little bit better. Gutfeld, what do you think? Do you think it's going to hurt the president? Or do you think Twitter might've stepped in it and might regret what they have done?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Trump loves to kick the tires of everything. This feels like he's kicking the tires. See what he can do and gets people riled up. It's hard because, like, the entirety of communication and culture is overwhelmingly leftward, entertainment, media, academia. That's all left. It's too late to roll back that stuff. There is the fourth horseman.</p><p>It's the one you should be concerned about, because if this horseman, social media, joins the other ones, then it's really over because this horseman controls the algorithms and that controls the news. It controls everything. So I understand that when Twitter decides to fact-check, we instinctively think who is doing the fact-checking?</p><p>Who is it? Is it this idiot that called everybody in the White House Nazis, because that's what happens everywhere else? They are overwhelmingly progressive and leftward. They think that Trump is racist. They think his followers are deplorable. Do you really want them in control? So that's why I think everybody is concerned about.</p><p>Because like I said before, if fact-checking is a highway, the red cars get pulled over and the blue cars don't. And I think that is where a lot of this animus comes from. It's not going to be fair and balanced like this beloved network.</p><p>WATTERS: Marie, why can't Joe Biden just get on Twitter if he knows how to do it and just, you know, reply back to the president if he says something, he thinks it crazy. Why does he need big tech guys to help him run his campaign?</p><p>HARF: This isn't about Joe Biden. I think everyone probably knows by now that I am not on Twitter because of the bullying and the threats. And I know, Jesse.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARF: This is Donald Trump trolling Twitter. He can't shut it down. He knows he can't shut it down. And the real question for Twitter is whether they are comfortable with their platform being used by anyone, including the president, to promote hateful, violent, dangerous, or outright fabrications to millions of people. That's a really hard question.</p><p>So, you know, the fact that Donald Trump is taking this action today is really not a legal one. It's a political one. This is his favorite kind of political action. This is grievance, politics. But let me tell you there are a lot of conservatives on Twitter. A lot of them went after me for a long time. That's why I'm not on there.</p><p>So, this idea that Twitter is not safe for conservatives is just not true. It's not borne out by the facts.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. So Lawrence, I mean, Marie makes the point that, you know, Twitter doesn't want to have people going on to their platform and lying and making threats, doing all this stuff, OK. So they would have to police it. The left and the right, but that's not what's going to happen. What's going to happen is they are just going to over police the right and then just look the other way when anybody on the left does anything crazy or lies.</p><p>JONES: Yes. And I think the big problem here is -- the problem with most companies when they get away from their value systems. The fact of the matter -- the action that they're taking right now is violating their mission statement. They said -- their mission statement is to share information and content without barriers. This is a new barrier. They are violating it.</p><p>They are trying to be the one between the people they are trying to reach. And look, I don't think the president is trying to shut down Twitter. I don't think that -- has nothing to do with that. What is trying to do is bring awareness to a big issue. Now, me as a conservative, I believe that this is a private company. They can do whatever they want to do.</p><p>But I think it's a bad business practice to violate your mission statement, as well as the main person, like Donald Trump. Everyone is coming there to see what he says on Twitter. He sets the news cycle on Twitter every single day. Those people will leave when he leaves. And so I think when it comes to competition, I think they let their politics get the best of them.</p><p>WATTERS: yes, and we know what their politics are. Coming up, millions of Americans could be heading back into the office, but it's going to look a lot different. We'll tell you more about that next.</p><p>MHARF: Returning to offices could look a lot different. The CDC issuing guidelines, including wearing masks indoors, wiping down surfaces, and banning handshakes. But as states begin easing lockdown restrictions, many businesses are finding that their employees would still rather work from home. Lawrence, I'm going to start with you here.</p><p>We have heard a lot in Washington, D.C., where I live, about the fact that if you can keep working from home, it helps essential workers who have to take public transportation. It helps keep public transportation less crowded. And so, we see people here saying they're not going to turn to office work until Labor Day or even next year. What do you make of these new guidelines and how some people still want to work from home?</p><p>JONES: Yes. I mean, I think, Marie, we expected this to happen. I mean, our company has changed. There's, you know, payroll department, different departments that have decided that we work better from home. So, I get that. The problem with these guidelines is that it seems to be this ongoing changing thing.</p><p>And I think that's the most frustrating thing for Americans is that, you know, if they would've just been honest and say we don't really know what we are working with. And so, when we said that you didn't need a mask, we really didn't know something, or when it came to the surfaces, that you really couldn't contract it from the surfaces.</p><p>And everybody went for the Lysol and everything. I think at the end of the day, what most Americans are finding is that we weren't being as sanitary as we should've been. And I think we have to put the destiny at most Americans hands. You're going to be able to choose. But this lockdown where we are at right now and some states refusing to open is a problem.</p><p>These guidelines should be a guide. In some cases, you need to do more. In some cases, you may not need to apply these guidelines. That's the way I look at it.</p><p>HARF: Dana, Lawrence brought up a really good point that what we know about the virus and how it's transmitted has changed so much since the beginning when they were telling us not to wear masks and now we are all supposed to. That makes these guidelines challenging, doesn't it, because people do think there's probably a lot we still don't know.</p><p>PERINO: Absolutely. And I've just been shocked that instead of just saying we don't know that they just keep issuing guidance. And then two days later, they revised the guidance. I think that America's companies were looking to the CDC to get some guidance like this, because they want to bring their workers back in a safe way, and they want to do it in a way to do it in a way that will prevent them from being sued, right? We live in a pretty litigious culture. And we know that all the lawsuits that are out there. And so, a company that says, well, look, we followed all the CDC guidelines, and we're really sorry that you came down with coronavirus. We don't know if it was here or wherever. I think that there's reasons to have this guidance.</p><p>But a couple of things. Yes, I think that for some companies, they found that their productivity in this period has remained a little bit the same. But I also think that there's fatigue setting in that people are going to miss out on that innovation and the collaboration that comes from running into your colleagues in the hallway.</p><p>However, I also think that it is true that one of the things people do not miss if they had a big commute, a tough commute, lots of traffic, delayed trains, where our infrastructure is not keeping up. I can imagine that some people say you know, it'd be better for me to just work from home.</p><p>So perhaps the best thing to do what Lawrence suggested, which is give the guidance, let companies figure it out, but try to get people back to work in some way. The other thing I would say is, I absolutely think that this guidance for restaurants has got to be lifted and alleviated.</p><p>And you cannot have people going into restaurants and expect them to come back if you have to eat with a piece of plastic all around your body. Like that's not going to happen and these restaurants will not survive if these local governments and maybe the CDC doesn't allow them some leeway, and fast.</p><p>HARF: Jesse, what about this question of liability that Dana brought up? Do you think that there should be protections for these companies who are bringing employees back, operating like we all are under incomplete information about the virus?</p><p>WATTERS: I do, but these left-wing Trial Lawyers probably won't let it slide, and the Democrats are in their pocket, so you know how that plays out? Did Lawrence Jones said something about the Fox News payroll department? We're still getting paid, right?</p><p>HARF: I think he did.</p><p>JONES: Right. Yes, we're still getting paid.</p><p>HARF: Yes, we're still getting paid, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: Because where they work remotely, if they come in, just keep the paychecks coming. So here's what I think about this remote work situation. I think it discriminates against certain types of people, good looking people, people with a great sense of humor, and people that are really good around the watercooler.</p><p>Like, you know, I make some of my best moves around the watercooler. You know, people laugh at my jokes, I get ideas for my show, people are impressed with the things that I'm wearing, I get promoted because, you know, I have a certain you know, how do you call it, I'm not going to say it in French, but you know what I mean.</p><p>If you're just judging people on how much they're producing or their quality of work, I mean, the quality -- you're just going to judge people on work quality alone, they're not talking about intangibles. We need intangibles in order for people to be judged fairly and that's why you need people to come into the office.</p><p>PERINO: Has anybody here ever seeing Jesse around the watercooler?</p><p>JONES: Not one time.</p><p>WATTERS: I don't even know where the watercooler is.</p><p>HARF: Greg, do you miss Jesse's joke?</p><p>PERINO: I know you don't.</p><p>HARF: Greg, I bet you miss Jesse's jokes a lot, right?</p><p>GUTFELD: He just -- he just described himself as Michael Scott in the office, the person who comes to the office and says, you know what, people like my jokes. I'm going to go over and make some conversation. I am -- you know what I find interesting is how self-righteous the media got telling you to stay home for three months under the threat of shaming, arrest, fines, but when it comes to looting, and vandalism, there's no shaming. It's like they could shame you because you weren't wearing a mask, but they're not shaming people carrying out TVs.</p><p>Anyway, I wanted to bring up the most awkward thing that's going to happen at work and that's getting onto an elevator. Because if the elevator door opens and there's two people in the elevator, do you get in? Or if you wait and somebody lines up behind you, are they going to be mad at you if you don't go in and they go in? This is going to be very complicated because the elevator is really could be one of the main ways a virus spreads because you're in a -- you're in a box with other people. You haven't thought about that, have you?</p><p>WATTERS: You got to take the stairs.</p><p>HARF: And you can use your foot to push the elevator button. That's -- you can like kick up and push the right elevator button or something.</p><p>GUTFELD: I think that's only in Asia. It hasn't started here yet. Dammit.</p><p>HARF: More to come on THE FIVE. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo causing controversy with what he is saying about nursing home death. Stay tuned.</p><p>JONES: More stunning incompetence from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. More than 5,000 nursing home residents died in his state after he ordered COVID patients be returned to assisted living facilities. And now he's admitting he wouldn't send his own mother to a nursing home during the crisis. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): If I were advising a friend, I would say you have a vulnerable person. Best to keep them at home and not put them in a congregate facility. Keep them in a situation where you have the most control. That is the blunt truth. That's what I would do with my mother.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: So Dana, very telling in his interview, he's taken a hit in the polls right now, and I want to pop this up, 48 percent of New Yorkers right now, when it comes to his handling, having a negative view of him and the way he's handled this nursing homework. The governor has been on all these press conferences. He got praise from both sides. Will this destroy that narrative right now?</p><p>PERINO: Well, it had to come back down to earth once the facts started to get out there. He is not used to being questioned. He was riding high for so long and you know, having fun with his brother on CNN, and then this story was relentless. And so this is where journalism actually catches up, and he has is force to answer it.</p><p>You know, he -- there was a story by Peter Hasson about how they're counting the numbers of nursing home deaths and maybe altering them. And there were -- there was days of media coverage when it was suggested that the woman down in Florida in charge of the data had been manipulating them and that she got fired, and then that was inappropriate. That turned out to be fake news. And then you have this story, and it's not getting as much attention. But I think because people are so upset that their loved ones that could have lived an average of 10 years longer were put in these positions.</p><p>Now, the last thing I'll say is great for him that he could have the resources to take care of his own mother if he had to. Most people don't have that capability. And they have to rely on a place in order to help them help their loved ones. And it's hard enough to make that decision that you have to put your parent or your loved one into a nursing home without him piling on and saying, well, basically you're saying, if you cared more, you would keep them home. That's disgustingly unfair.</p><p>JONES: Marie, you know, a lot of the pushback that the mayor -- I'm sorry, that the governor is getting right now is that a lot of the families want to sue. They want to get involved and they're not able to sue because the mayor gave these hospital executives immunity. What are your thoughts about that?</p><p>HARF: Well, Governor Cuomo said that he made this decision because he was following initial CDC guidance -- going back to CDC guidance, again -- that I think 10 other states also followed. That turned out to be tragically not good. So, he certainly does bear responsibility. I think governors should be able to trust the guidance they're getting from the CDC, and in this case, that wasn't true.</p><p>I think with litigation, it's going to be very messy on this issue and many others related to COVID. I don't know how it's going to play out, but it's going to be messy.</p><p>JONES: Jesse, I interview some folks and it'll be on \"HANNITY\" tonight that their mother died as a result of this. And they didn't isolate these patients. You know, one lady told me, you know, I brought my mom in with a leg injury and she left in a body bag. That was a real quote. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. They were sending body bags to these nursing homes along with patients like a two for one deal. Marie is wrong about the guidelines. The guidelines didn't say stuff sick people in the nursing homes. It was a lot more than that. And if those were the guidelines, why didn't DeSantis do it? He did something totally different, and that was brilliant, and he saved countless lives.</p><p>Now, when I do something wrong, I blame everybody but myself. You know, I blame Greg that he set me up. I'll say other producers screwed up. I'll try to delete an e-mail. It's exactly what Cuomo did. Remember what he did? First, he played dumb? Oh, what directive? And then he said, oh, you know what -- in the dark, he tried to like delete it. And then he said, oh, well Trump told me to do it. And now he said, no, it's the nursing home's fault.</p><p>So he got caught red-handed, and now he's scrambling, and everybody could see he made a bonehead error, but the media is just covering for him.</p><p>JONES: Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, I was going to say what I've said before, but it kind of drives me crazy that he had Chris Rock and Rosie Perez there, kind of like a celebrity bells and whistles. But the pandemic -- the pandemic reveals I think the true weaknesses and strengths of our country. We found out about American unity, innovation, and industry. But our weaknesses were bureaucracy, the media, politics and eldercare.</p><p>So I think we need you know, to look at revamping nursing homes, to get better pay for the people that are there to entice better personnel, tax credits for family with elderly, limit the number of patients or people who live there so you don't have a World War II vet, you know, sitting in his own, you know, stuff for three hours because nobody's there.</p><p>The fact is, this is like the -- this is the finish line of life. And if you are lucky, you're going to make it to that age only to be kicked off the planet in the most degrading way possible. Your reward for making it this long for defending a country, raising a family, doing great things in this world, your reward is abuse and neglect. And that's the big story is how we warehouse the elderly like their burdens with a pulse, when in fact they should be treasured and valued because they gave so much and we're giving them so little.</p><p>JONES: We should definitely treat our elders with more respect than that. And the governor definitely should take an ail on this. Anyway, we got to go. More of THE FIVE coming up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Welcome back. Well, according to science, cursing has medical benefits. It makes you feel better. But don't just take Dana's word for it and her filthy mouth. New research reaffirming a study that showed people's pain tolerance actually goes up by as much as 33 percent. If they repeatedly said the F word, Dana, and of course the F word, I'll say it right now, it's Fox News. For a lot of people, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Not to some people. Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. So, you swear like a drunken sailor.</p><p>PERINO: I mean -- oh, yes, yes. I mean, I have no pain.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: So, no pain, no gain. I guess it works for me.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: I had a friend, I won't name her, that I worked with at the White House. She could say the F word better than anyone I ever knew. But my -- Hamdah Salhut, you know the assistant, she has no pain either, believe me.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, Marie, I have a theory that swearing doesn't replace other words, it actually replaces actions. So before swearing was invented, if you stubbed your toe, you would probably hit someone with a rock. But now when you stub your toe, you just swear. So it's a really good thing because it deep -- it changed our behavior.</p><p>HARF: And it's a good outlet. It's a good way to your frustration. And -- but it has to be used well. You can't use it too much. We can't overuse it because then it loses its meaning. It has to be well applied. And I fully support that, certainly.</p><p>GUTFELD: Lawrence, you -- I've never heard you swear.</p><p>JONES: Oh, I do.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes?</p><p>JONES: The problem is, is when I use the F word, that means I am really upset. But I think we should support this because at least you're voicing it and not putting your hands-on people or objects or something. So I think this is something we should endorse.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, Jesse, because when we say the F word, we actually know what the word is. Should we come up with another word that represents the phrase F word? Because F word is actually even worse because it makes you think about the word. So should we have another word that represents the F word that represents the other word?</p><p>WATTERS: We're the F is your monologue, Gutfeld? This is your monologue? This is it? Like, you think you're just going to get away with this?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, I just -- on Thursdays I write -- I put together the show for Saturday. Don't you know that by now?</p><p>WATTERS: OK, OK, I got it. I got it. I'm just checking. I missed it, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know. I know. You know what, it makes me warm all over that you care. And on that note, \"ONE MORE THING is up next.</p><p>WATTERS: I do.</p><p>PERINO: Fox News alert. The FBI and law enforcement officials are giving an update on the investigation into the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ERICA MACDONALD, U.S. ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA: The county attorney, Mr. Freeman, standing to my right is here to talk to you about state investigation. With me is Rainer Drolshagen. He is the Special Agent in Charge of Minneapolis FBI. He too will talk about the federal investigation. And Superintendent Drew Evans from BCA will also make a few comments before we open it up for question and answer.</p><p>My name is Eric MacDonald. I'm the United States Attorney here for the district of Minnesota. On May 25th of 2020, George Floyd was arrested and detained by Minneapolis police officers. I'm here to talk about and make sure the community and the media is aware that we are conducting a robust and meticulous investigation into the circumstances surrounding the events of May 25, 2020 and the police officers' actions on that evening.</p><p>I really probably don't need this to say this to all of you but Minneapolis, our nation, really the world has witnessed this incredibly and disturbing loss of life. My heart goes out to George Floyd. My heart goes out to his family, my heart goes out to his friends, and my heart goes out to the community. We are grieving and we will continue to grieve.</p><p>To be clear, the Department of Justice has made the investigation in this case a top priority. We have assigned highest of the high in my office to investigate and look at the case. FBI likewise has assigned their experienced law enforcement officers to conduct the investigation.</p><p>And to be clear, President Trump, as well as Attorney General William Barr are directly and actively monitoring the investigation in this case. I've had direct communications with Attorney General Barr and his staff and will continue to do so. The federal investigation in this case will determine whether the actions of the former Minneapolis police officers took violated any federal criminal laws to include any civil rights violations.</p><p>Federal civil rights, criminal cases have categories and one is called under color of law. In other words, if an officer whether it be federal, state, local or tribal, is acting under their authority and asserts or invokes the power bestowed upon them to deprive any person of any right or privilege protected by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. That is a violation of federal criminal law.</p><p>It must be proven that the subject took action or did not take action when he or she knew that was wrong and chose to do it anyway. As with all matters, the investigation in this case will be comprehensive and will be conducted with the highest integrity as the community would expect.</p><p>For those that aren't aware of my background, prior to being the United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota, I was a judge in Dakota County for over eight-plus years. Having sat on that side of the bench and having presided over a multitude of trials, I can tell you, I can tell the community, I can tell everybody interested that it is critical, it is essential, it is imperative that this investigation is done right and done right the first time. And that is what we are going to do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052801cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-BVT1-DXH2-635K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Healthcare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pharmaceuticals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Andrew Cuomo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Swearing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George Floyd</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Criminal Penalties</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzc4Qzk2RkU2QzRGNEUxOUEzREYxMTNEQ0Q3MkNBN0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzVGMjU5MTU0NEQ1NDEzMUJCMERBQTQ0MzUwNzVGMjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Government Actions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTU2Q0I2QUMzRTZDNDJENzk3MDIxMDU3QjM3Njc3MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzY3QkFENTU3MTlENDk5ODgxNTU4NjgzRkFFRjIxN0E</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

People are hankering for governments to do more to regulate these corporate giants,\u201d said Tanya O\u2019Carroll, Director of Amnesty Tech.</p><p>\u201cThe results are a damning indictment of how Big Tech companies harvest and use our personal data. People want to see an end to tech companies trampling over our right to privacy.\u201d</p><p>Respondents who are worried about the collection of their personal data are most concerned with the violation of their right to privacy (62%), with a majority (59%) also worried about the loss of control over their data.</p><p>The poll results are stark and consistent - a clear majority of people are worried about the power Big Tech has over their lives. Tanya O\u2019Carroll, Director of Amnesty Tech.</p><p>Of those who said they are worried, more than half (51%) are concerned that data about their online activity might reveal a lot about them; while almost a third (32%) fear their data could be used by state authorities to target them.</p><p>The central business model underpinning the internet today \u2013 using data to create detailed profiles of people for the purpose of selling targeted advertising \u2013 is seen as a major problem by nearly eight in ten people (77%).</p><p>When asked to explain why, six in ten said (59%) it was an invasion of privacy. More than half (53%) are concerned people could be unfairly influenced with political advertising without their knowledge. Nearly half (48%) also felt that advertisers would target people when they are at their most vulnerable.</p><p>In the USA, where next year\u2019s Presidential race is well underway, three in four (75%) Americans said it is a problem that tech companies create and sell access to detailed personal profiles. Six in ten (61%), of those who said it was a problem, were concerned people could be unfairly influenced by political advertising.</p><p>\u201cScandals like Cambridge Analytica\u2019s illicit harvesting of millions of people\u2019s personal data have seriously damaged public trust in tech companies,\u201d said Tanya O\u2019Carroll.</p><p>\u201cGovernments need to take action on the manipulation of targeted online political advertising. Our poll shows that people simply don\u2019t trust Big Tech to determine the terms of political debate.\u201dFaceobook poses a systemic threat to human rights including privacy with their surveillance based business model.Sebastien Thibault/agoodson.com</p><p>Almost half of those polled (49%) are more cautious about how they share their personal information online. Over a third (37%) avoid certain search terms or web pages because they are concerned about tracking, while the same percentage of people (37%) elected not to use a platform because of data privacy concerns. This shows that online corporate surveillance is having a chilling on people\u2019s ability to access the digital world. Nearly a third (32%) use tools to limit online tracking.</p><p>The results of the poll reinforce Amnesty\u2019s analysis that the core business-model of Facebook and Google poses a systemic threat to human rights. Last month, Amnesty International released an in-depth report showing how the surveillance-based business model of the two tech giants is incompatible with every element of the right to privacy. This includes freedom from intrusion into our private lives, the right to control information about ourselves, and the right to a space in which we can freely express our identities. It also showed how the business model poses a threat to a range of other rights including freedom of opinion expression and assembly, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</p><p>Amnesty International is calling on governments to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect people from corporate human rights abuses. As a first step, governments must enact and enforce laws that prevent companies from making access to their services conditional on individuals \u201cconsenting\u201d to the collection, processing or sharing of their personal data for marketing or advertising.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2688589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNR-5XB1-F0YC-N10V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

People are hankering for governments to do more to regulate these corporate giants,\" said Tanya O'Carroll, Director of Amnesty Tech.</p><p>\"The results are a damning indictment of how Big Tech companies harvest and use our personal data. People want to see an end to tech companies trampling over our right to privacy.\"</p><p>Respondents who are worried about the collection of their personal data are most concerned with the violation of their right to privacy (62%), with a majority (59%) also worried about the loss of control over their data.</p><p>Of those who said they are worried, more than half (51%) are concerned that data about their online activity might reveal a lot about them; while almost a third (32%) fear their data could be used by state authorities to target them.</p><p>The central business model underpinning the internet today using data to create detailed profiles of people for the purpose of selling targeted advertising is seen as a major problem by nearly eight in ten people (77%).</p><p>When asked to explain why, six in ten said (59%) it was an invasion of privacy. More than half (53%) are concerned people could be unfairly influenced with political advertising without their knowledge. Nearly half (48%) also felt that advertisers would target people when they are at their most vulnerable.</p><p>In the U.S., where next year's Presidential race is well underway, three in four (75%) Americans said it is a problem that tech companies create and sell access to detailed personal profiles. Six in ten (61%), of those who said it was a problem, were concerned people could be unfairly influenced by political advertising.</p><p>\"Scandals like Cambridge Analytica's illicit harvesting of millions of people's personal data have seriously damaged public trust in tech companies,\" said Tanya O'Carroll.</p><p>\"Governments need to take action on the manipulation of targeted online political advertising. Our poll shows that people simply don't trust Big Tech to determine the terms of political debate.\"</p><p>Almost half of those polled (49%) are more cautious about how they share their personal information online. Over a third (37%) avoid certain search terms or web pages because they are concerned about tracking, while the same percentage of people (37%) elected not to use a platform because of data privacy concerns. This shows that online corporate surveillance is having a chilling on people's ability to access the digital world. Nearly a third (32%) use tools to limit online tracking.</p><p>The results of the poll reinforce Amnesty's analysis that the core business-model of Facebook and Google poses a systemic threat to human rights. Last month, Amnesty International released an in-depth report showing how the surveillance-based business model of the two tech giants is incompatible with every element of the right to privacy. This includes freedom from intrusion into our private lives, the right to control information about ourselves, and the right to a space in which we can freely express our identities. It also showed how the business model poses a threat to a range of other rights including freedom of opinion expression and assembly, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</p><p>Amnesty International is calling on governments to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect people from corporate human rights abuses. As a first step, governments must enact and enforce laws that prevent companies from making access to their services conditional on individuals \"consenting\" to the collection, processing or sharing of their personal data for marketing or advertising.</p><p>Note to Editors: All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 9,312 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 17th October 1st November 2019. The survey was carried out online.

The emergence of \"tech-lash,\" he says, highlights some valid public concerns, but none rise to the level of justifying the drastic solutions peddled by \"antitrust populists:\" breaking up the big tech firms or regulating them as public utilities.</p><p>Instead, Litan offers a measured policy response to economic concentration. \"While there is a temptation to turn to radical solutions to fix our problems - with growing income inequality and our newfound worries about a loss of privacy - major departures from existing policies, especially toward some of the most successful private sector firms and the major economic and social benefits they have generated, also risk unintended costly consequences with uncertain benefits,\" he writes.</p><p>\"Bob Litan's timely new ebook establishes a new benchmark for rigorous and systematic thinking about the impact of America's dominant tech platforms on competition and inequality,\" said PPI President Will Marshall. \" It illuminates the real problems progressives should tackle and offers pragmatic remedies that won't jeopardize America's crucial lead in high-tech innovation.\"</p><p>Among his key findings, Litan concludes that while tech platforms on balance have not harmed economy-wide innovation, there is evidence that the strength of competition throughout the economy has lessened somewhat. There is also evidence that the rise of the tech platforms and concentrated employer markets across multiple sectors at the local level are contributing to wage inequality.</p><p>Anti-trust policy, however, isn't the right lever for dealing with these concerns, Litan maintains. Other targeted policies, outside antitrust, would improve the state of competition in America, including lifting unnecessary occupational licensing requirements, an end to \"no poaching\" agreements, and a return to freer trade, which disciplines pricing by U.S. companies.</p><p>\"There is yet no sound legal or policy basis for to break technology platform firms up for antitrust or other reasons. The law justifiably requires severe and/or sustained anticompetitive conduct as a precondition for court-ordered breakups,\" he writes.</p><p>Noting the trend toward mergers between firms with dominant positions in different markets, the book proposes tightening the statutory test for mergers and establishing a rebuttable presumption against mergers where the acquiring firm has a dominant position in its market and has the ability to effectively enter any market in which the acquired firm competes.</p><p>Nonetheless, the growth of these firms has generated significant non-antitrust concerns about data security and privacy. Litan recommends updating data laws to protect privacy and security by requiring all firms, not just those in tech, to provide plain English explanations of what data the firms collect about consumers and how it is used, the ability to opt out of having their information shared with third parties, and the full disclosure of funding for political ads. He argues that federal law should also require all large data warehouses - a term that would require further definition in an authorized rulemaking - to adopt reasonable measures to ensure data security.</p><p>A Scalpel, Not an Axe also warns that the strongest regulations tech's critics demand may also pose a threat to competition. \"In all that they do to regulate the tech industry more intensely, policymakers must be aware that additional data-related regulation is likely to favor large incumbent tech firms relative to smaller competitors and new entrants. Regulatory compliance is a fixed cost, and larger firms can take advantage of their economies of scale to comply,\" Litan writes.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6443933 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6443933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T86-PCG1-DYG2-R24C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><timeReceived>6:03 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The emergence of \"tech-lash,\" he says, highlights some valid public concerns, but none rise to the level of justifying the drastic solutions peddled by \"antitrust populists:\" breaking up the big tech firms or regulating them as public utilities.</p><p>Instead, Litan offers a measured policy response to economic concentration. \"While there is a temptation to turn to radical solutions to fix our problems with growing income inequality and our newfound worries about a loss of privacy major departures from existing policies, especially toward some of the most successful private sector firms and the major economic and social benefits they have generated, also risk unintended costly consequences with uncertain benefits,\" he writes.</p><p>\"Bob Litan's timely new ebook establishes a new benchmark for rigorous and systematic thinking about the impact of America's dominant tech platforms on competition and inequality,\" said PPI President Will Marshall. It illuminates the real problems progressives should tackle and offers pragmatic remedies that won't jeopardize America's crucial lead in high-tech innovation.\"</p><p>Among his key findings, Litan concludes that while tech platforms on balance have not harmed economy-wide innovation, there is evidence that the strength of competition throughout the economy has lessened somewhat. There is also evidence that the rise of the tech platforms and concentrated employer markets across multiple sectors at the local level are contributing to wage inequality.</p><p>Anti-trust policy, however, isn't the right lever for dealing with these concerns, Litan maintains. Other targeted policies, outside antitrust, would improve the state of competition in America, including lifting unnecessary occupational licensing requirements, an end to \"no poaching\" agreements, and a return to freer trade, which disciplines pricing by U.S. companies.</p><p>\"There is yet no sound legal or policy basis for to break technology platform firms up for antitrust or other reasons. The law justifiably requires severe and/or sustained anticompetitive conduct as a precondition for court-ordered breakups,\" he writes.</p><p>Noting the trend toward mergers between firms with dominant positions in different markets, the book proposes tightening the statutory test for mergers and establishing a rebuttable presumption against mergers where the acquiring firm has a dominant position in its market and has the ability to effectively enter any market in which the acquired firm competes.</p><p>Nonetheless, the growth of these firms has generated significant non-antitrust concerns about data security and privacy. Litan recommends updating data laws to protect privacy and security by requiring all firms, not just those in tech, to provide plain English explanations of what data the firms collect about consumers and how it is used, the ability to opt out of having their information shared with third parties, and the full disclosure of funding for political ads. He argues that federal law should also require all large data warehouses a term that would require further definition in an authorized rulemaking to adopt reasonable measures to ensure data security.</p><p>A Scalpel, Not an Axe also warns that the strongest regulations tech's critics demand may also pose a threat to competition. \"In all that they do to regulate the tech industry more intensely, policymakers must be aware that additional data-related regulation is likely to favor large incumbent tech firms relative to smaller competitors and new entrants. Regulatory compliance is a fixed cost, and larger firms can take advantage of their economies of scale to comply,\" Litan writes.</p><p># # #</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122381573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T86-GCD1-JCBF-S0VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As they consider measures to enhance roads and bridges, they also should focus on America's electricity infrastructure. By focusing on investment, efficiency, and markets as their policy foundation, the U.S. will have a world-class electricity system that will advance our economy into the 21st century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Electricity is a marvel, something even physicists don't fully understand, yet it is the foundation for our entire economy. Think for a moment about how many interactions you've had just this morning with electric power from your alarm clock, to your radio or television, to your hair dryer or shaver, to your computer or smart phone, and on and on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moreover, electricity generation and delivery constitute our nation's largest industry in terms of capital investment. Less flattering, electric generators are the biggest source of harmful pollution.</p><p>U.S. electricity infrastructure is old and frayed. More than 70 percent of our grid the lines and transformers that deliver electricity to our homes and businesses is at least 25 years old. The average power plant in this country is 34 years old. Luckily, modern technologies are transforming the grid. And what's more, new players are entering and bringing innovation into the once-monopolized and risk-adverse electricity industry. Unfortunately, its regulation is still stuck in the past. Let's change that, starting at the federal level.</p><p>The cost of America's old grid</p><p>On any given day, this old system causes half a million Americans to lose power for two or more hours. Our system, in fact, is shockingly unreliable compared to those in every other developed nation, putting the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage: We suffer some 360 minutes of outages each year, compared with just 16 minutes for Korea, 15 for Germany, and only 11 for Japan.</p><p>One more statistic: The length of a U.S. power outage averages 120 minutes and that number is growing, while in the rest of the industrialized world it's less than ten minutes and shrinking.</p><p>Such unreliability is expensive. You may not care much if your lights are off for 120 minutes, but computer-based businesses lose millions and millions of dollars when the electric current flickers even a tiny amount. According to Navigant Research, we pay for twice as many power plants as we actually need and suffer their pollution because of \"the massive inefficiencies built into this system.\"</p><p>We pay for twice as many power plants as we need.</p><p>How technology changed the energy landscape</p><p>Enter modern technology. Fracking and horizontal-drilling capabilities have vastly lowered the cost of natural gas. This has caused the dramatic and recent shift in how we generate electricity, from coal to natural gas which has led to lower costs and less climate change causing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The diversity of power options, moreover, is increasing. Prices for solar power modules have fallen 70 percent in the past six years. Wind power costs have dropped 58 percent in the past five years. Battery prices have fallen approximately 14 percent annually since 2007.</p><p>These are remarkable advances, but arguably the most significant technological change in the electricity industry is the introduction of innovative sensors, smart meters, and advanced communication technologies. These tools are attracting hundreds of entrepreneurs and deep-pocketed players as well as their investment and jobs into what long has been an innovation-adverse, monopoly-dominated industry.</p><p>All these new smart-grid technologies provide enormous quantities of data. How we utilize that data will have major impacts on consumers, the environment, and the future electricity system. The proliferation of these sensors and digital communication devices, for instance, can allow traditional generators to improve the operation of their power plants. They allow small and intermittent generators, like rooftop solar panels and wind turbines, to integrate smoothly onto and bolster the electric grid. On top of that, they're opening the door for clever companies to help consumers better manage their energy use in ways that save money and cut pollution. Some studies have found that just the availability of real-time energy-use data leads to energy efficiency gains of 15 percent.</p><p>The availability of real-time energy-use data leads to energy efficiency gains of 15 percent.</p><p>Businesses are taking notice</p><p>New players are entering energy markets. Google recently entered the electricity business by buying big blocks of renewable energy for its large data centers, and by acquiring Nest, the maker of smart thermostats and home devices. Google sees opportunity and profits in using innovative technologies to help Americans better manage their energy use. Like Google, Silicon Valley innovators Apple and Facebook are also are well on their way to meeting internal commitments to 100 percent renewable energy.</p><p>It's not just big tech companies who are starting to participate. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, used to buy all its power from local utilities. Last year, however, it met 26 percent of its electricity needs from its own solar panels and wind turbines. And it's planning to increase that number to 100 percent.</p><p>Google and Walmart are two of the big names, yet there are hundreds of new entrepreneurs and small firms bringing innovation and investment into the electricity industry. These new players are advancing modern technologies and introducing new services to consumers, all while increasing the grid's reliability. They are transforming an industry long dominated by state-based monopoly utilities into something more diverse, vibrant, competitive, and innovative.</p><p>In short, this combination of new technologies and new players means this ain't your grandfather's power grid unfortunately, it's just regulated that way.</p><p>This combination of new technologies and new players means this ain't your grandfather's power grid.</p><p>How can regulation catch up?</p><p>The regulation of the electricity industry is byzantine. While most electricity companies are privately or investor owned, the federal government controls some of the largest utilities (such as TVA and BPA), while others are managed by municipal governments or rural coops. In some states, electricity generators compete in open markets, while in other states the generation of power as well as its delivery is controlled by a monopoly that enjoys guaranteed profits and freedom from competitors.</p><p>Although electrons don't care about state boundaries, state public utility commissions regulate power markets within those boundaries while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees wholesale or interstate markets and the feds and states often battle over jurisdiction. Separate agencies regulate the pollution that results from electricity generation. The complexities go on and on.</p><p>This is why our leaders should consider the following broad themes or goals when developing energy policies:</p><p>Infrastructure-investment. As federal leadership considers infrastructure legislation, they should think of modernizing our frayed electricity system. This would provide some public-sector resources but, more importantly, stimulate investments from new private-sector players.</p><p>Efficiency. Any environmental legislation should include a focus on efficiency or stimulate the innovative technologies that cut costly waste from the system.</p><p>Markets. Markets and competition rather than bailouts and monopolies are key. We have a chance with modern technologies, the availability of massive amounts of data, and the arrival of new competitors to increase reliability, lower costs, as well as reduce pollution.</p><p>With these three guiding principles in mind, we at Environmental Defense Fund hope the new federal administration includes a focus on modernizing our electricity infrastructure when evaluating how to meet the country's overall infrastructure needs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121000633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MP3-HFN1-JCBF-S4RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 21, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Continue reading New privacy bill would give parents an  Eraser Button  and ban ads targeting children</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, two senators have proposed a major update to one of the only federal privacy laws in the United States. If approved, the changes to the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) would codify a set of parental controls and ban targeted advertising to young minors.</p><p>Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) plan to introduce the bipartisan measure today that would amend COPPA in order to extend privacy protections to children up to age 15. COPPA already prohibits companies like Facebook and Google from collecting personal data and location information from anyone under the age of 13 without explicit parental consent, but the senators  new bill amending the law would extend protections to children up to age 15. However, if approved, platforms would only be able to collect the data of children aged 13 to 15 with their own, personal consent and not that of their parents.</p><p>In 2019, children and adolescents  every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children s well-being at the top of Congress s priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.</p><p>An  Eraser Button  would remove all of a child s data from the related service</p><p>One significant update would be the increased controls the legislation would give parents over their children s personal data on these platforms. If approved, it would create what the senators called an  Eraser Button  that would remove all of a child s data from the related service. If a parent or child decides to delete all of their data, no platform would be able to discontinue service to that user.</p><p>Just last month, the Federal Trade Commission penalized TikTok s parent company with a record-setting $5.7 million for violating current COPPA regulations. In a press release, the FTC claimed that TikTok was collecting the personal data of children under 13 without receiving explicit consent from their parents. Under these proposed rules, apps and platforms like TikTok would have to abide by stronger privacy protections for children up to age 15 as well.</p><p>Platforms would also be barred from serving targeted ads to children under 13.</p><p>When it comes to connected devices and toys targeted toward children, the bill would also ensure that companies and manufacturers include some kind of disclosure on the packaging for parents detailing how their child s data would be collected, retained, shared, and protected. And if those devices don t meet a set of robust cybersecurity standards, they would be banned from stores.</p><p>Once approved, companies would have a year before they would be required to disclose to its users, in plain language, the types of data it collects, how it s used, and the mechanisms used in order to ensure that data is not collected from minors.</p><p> Big tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids  personal data. It s time to hold them accountable,  Hawley said.  Congress needs to get serious about keeping our children s information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online. </p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Website:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261181/eraser-button-bill-children-privacy-coppa-hawley-markey\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261181/eraser-button-bill-children-privacy-coppa-hawley-markey</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Makena Kelly<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecom20190312newprivacybillwouldgiveparentsaneraserbuttonandbanadstargetingchildren</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMH-YH71-JCTB-F2CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><timeReceived>12:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here for Kristie Lu Stout, welcome to News Stream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CURNOW: And anti-U.S. protests from Jerusalem to Jordan, as fresh anger spilled into the streets over a controversial decision by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Building a coalition against Iran, the U.S. wants action over what it says is new evidence Iran is arming Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And changing the internet as we know it -- why? A number of major companies are pushing back following a vote by U.S. regulators.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CURNOW: We begin this Friday with a tense new picture across much of the Muslim world. Protesters are taking to the streets of cities in the Middle East. Once again over Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p><p>These pictures from Jordanian TV show, thousands of people gathering in the capital Amman. We are covering the story from all angles. Oren Liebermann is in Jerusalem. Arwa Damon is in the West Bank. Arwa, to you first, what's happening right now?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: (OFF-MIKE) -- so we have been seeing throughout the West Bank, throughout Jerusalem to a certain lesser degree and in Gaza as well.</p><p>We've had demonstration like these clashes, like just happening on a fairly regular basis ever since President Trump made that announcement about the status of Jerusalem. But we are beginning to see them intensify.</p><p>We are beginning to see the crowds pick up. We are beginning to see them longer and more determined when it comes to just wanting to try to confront the Israeli forces. You have become fairly common flash points, this is one of them.</p><p>We were at another one earlier in the day. That one was broken up fairly quickly. But this particular location has been fairly regular throughout. We have these confrontations all the time. You can see the ground -- I don't know if you can see it.</p><p>But actually this street is covered with rocks that they -- you see most of the youth have been throwing at the Israeli security forces there, responding with tear gas, with rubber bullets.</p><p>And the concern, of course, amongst the broader population is where do they go from here? They do feel as if they have a certain amount of momentum, because of the support that they have seen to demonstrations taking place in other parts of the world, in other parts of the region.</p><p>There is a sense that there is a certain level of perhaps broader momentum because of the summit that took place in Istanbul that led to the declaration and recognition by the Islamic Muslim nations that they would consider East Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Palestine.</p><p>But at the same time, there is also this reality that happens here on a fairly regular basis. Now as I was saying, intensifying over the course of the last few days, there was a massive call of course from the leaders of various -- from different parties including Palestine (Inaudible) to come out onto the treats to try to confront the Israelis wherever they can.</p><p>But at the same time a lot of people are wondering, where do these kinds of clashes go? How do they actually move forward at this stage and try to bring about a longer lasting solution and a lot of questions as to whether or not, is that actually possible at all.</p><p>CURNOW: OK. Arwa Damon, thanks so much. We'll come back to you if there is any more movement there. Oren Liebermann, you are at by the Old City. I think you are at Damascus gate. Give us a sense of what's happening where you are.</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Some 35,000 worshipers parade at Al- Aqsa Mosque, which is staggering high number for what is otherwise an average Friday. Of course, it's not average because of Donald Trump's announcement last week.</p><p>And that is what propelled or compelled all of these worshipers here. The vast many of them left fairly quickly and fairly peacefully. There was some violent pushing and shoving as Israeli security forces tried to clear out those worshippers as quickly as possible.</p><p>[08:05:04] You can see the barriers here in place behind me, in front of the Damascus gate, that was a measure of crowd control to try to keep people moving in one direction, to try to get them out, essentially to end the tension here as quickly as possible.</p><p>Of course, it reins tense. And it will remain tense, especially with what's coming next week. Vice President Mike Pence visiting the region, expected to visit Jerusalem. So if today was bigger last week, it's very possible that next week will be bigger than this week.</p><p>Again, a very high number of worshippers at Al-Aqsa, this is one of the flash points in Jerusalem. And it will remain so as the region itself remains tense, watching what comes next and what Mike Pence says on his visit may have an impact how big next Friday is.</p><p>But as, Arwa, pointed out, we've seen clashes across Jerusalem and across the West Bank because of a continued anger -- simmering anger in many ways over the announcement of Trump.</p><p>CURNOW: Like you say, it certainly gathering momentum. And that is the sense that we are getting from, Arwa Damon, as well. Arwa, back to you. I think you will be able to take your gas the mask off. And just give us again a sense of what you're seeing on the ground there in the West Bank.</p><p>DAMON: You know, you see people's anger and frustration expressed in many different ways. Of course, these scenes, these types of clashes, they're fairly common here, whatever these issues, this tension rises up to the forefront.</p><p>And, of course, that announcement by President Trump about the status of Jerusalem has literally as many here will tell you just throwing not even gasoline on the fire, an entire oil tanker on the fire.</p><p>People to a certain degree feel not only has the U.S. lost it's position as being a potential honest broker and the sort of future peace talks but also that perhaps President Trump deliberately wanted to try to enflame tensions in the region.</p><p>When you speak to the Palestinians, the youth who are out here engaging in these types of clashes, they'll say, look, we don't have anything else to fight back with. We could go out and try and protest peacefully, but we can't.</p><p>We're not allowed to do that, even when we try to do that, it serves nothing and this is the only thing that we have to fight back, with these rocks that they keep throwing at the Israeli security forces.</p><p>They know that they're not going to win this battle. It's not necessarily about trying to win or gain ground. It's about trying to make that statement. And people really feel as if, at this point they need to make a very strong statement.</p><p>Of course speak to members amongst the Palestinian leadership, they are to a certain degree wanting to see things grow and develop into widespread as peaceful as they can possibly be.</p><p>Demonstrations again trying to capitalize as I was saying earlier on this momentum that they feel exist right now because after President Trump made that declaration, no other country followed suit.</p><p>So for the Palestinians, they are taking that to a certain degree as being a reflection of how other nations feel. They feel to a certain degree as if they are not perhaps entirely on their own at this stage.</p><p>But then, of course the question becomes, where do they go from here thus the situation? Do these types of clashes that we are seeing right now, does this escalate or can this somehow be walked back towards resemblance of a peace process.</p><p>Bear in mind too, Robyn, that declarations we have heard from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, various other different leaders, are saying that they are no longer is a role for the United States when it comes to mediating any sort of potential two-state solution.</p><p>We heard from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying that now, they are going to be turning towards the United Nations, trying to look for options for another nation or nations that could potentially try to mediate and begin bringing both sides to the table. But you really have a phenomenally tense situation right now, these types of scenes playing out on a fairly regular basis.</p><p>CURNOW: And as you rightly say the big question, where it goes from here? Arwa Damon, there on the West Bank, thank you and to Oren Liebermann who is just outside the Old City.</p><p>Now Iran denies U.S. allegations that it is arming Houthi militias in Yemen. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations called on international community to build a coalition and quickly got the backing of Saudi Arabia. Nikki Haley made her case while standing before missile debris. We'll cover from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: this evidence is a part of what has led the U.S. Intelligence Community to conclude unequivocally that these weapons were supplied by the Iranian regime. The evidence is undeniable. The weapons might as well have had made in Iran stickers all over it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:10:00] CURNOW: Well, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres says experts are still examining the missile debris. Well, Ben Wedeman, joins us from Beirut with more details, and also more reaction. Hi, Ben.</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hello, Robyn. Well, the rocket that Nikki Haley was standing in front of is a Qiam rocket which has about a 750 kilometer range.</p><p>Now the Saudis claim that one of those rockets on splay was the rocket fired on the night of the 4th of November from Yemen in the direction of Riyadh international airport.</p><p>However, arms experts say that those rockets that she was showing do not appear to have been intercepted by the patriot missile systems supplied by the United States that the Saudis say were able take down that missile.</p><p>Also it's important to keep in mind that it's not clear when these weapons might have been supplied by the Iranians. Now Ambassador Haley is suggesting that Iran is in violation of U.N. Securities Council Resolution 2231, which bars Iran from selling, supplying or transferring certain weapons without the approval of the U.N. Security Council.</p><p>But that resolution went into effect in July of 2015 and, of course, the war in Yemen between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition began in March of 2015. So there are lots of questions about these American claims and lots of doubt as well.</p><p>For instance, we did see a tweet from the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif who -- in this tweet he puts up a picture of Colin Powell on the right when in 2003 he went before the U.N. Security Council arguing that Saddam Hussein's Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>The other picture was Ambassador Haley in front of that Qiam missile. And he wrote with those two pictures, when I was based at the U.N., I saw this show and what it begat.</p><p>Of course, what it begat, was these false claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which led to the U.S.-led war against Iraq and the disasters that have followed afterwards.</p><p>It doesn't appear that the United States is, as Ambassador Haley said, going to form an anti-Iranian coalition that many of the partners of George W. Bush's coalition of the willing that fought the war in Iraq would be willing to go that way with the United States.</p><p>And also, Robyn, it's important to keep in mind that the United States has supplied hundreds of billions of dollars in advanced weapons systems and ammunition to Saudi Arabia, which has used quite limberly in Yemen.</p><p>In fact, there is a report from amnesty international. I'm just going to read this, which says that countries such as the U.S., U.K. and France, which continue to supply coalition members, meaning Saudi Arabia, with arms are allowing Saudi Arabia and its allies to flagrantly flaunt international law and being complicit, engrave -- I don't have my glasses, basically, war crimes.</p><p>And keep in mind, of course, that Yemen -- in Yemen according to U.N., nearly 8 million people are at threat of famine. So as the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride wild in Yemen, it appear that perhaps, allies in the United States would rather see the war in Yemen brought to an end rather than another war along the lines of Iraq going forward led by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Robyn.</p><p>CURNOW: Yes, it is fascinating. And certainly, the amnesty there sort of basically saying, stop calling the kettle black. It will be interesting to see where this all goes and what that show-and-tell in the U.N. was laying the ground for. Ben Wedeman, as always, thank you.</p><p>So years of civil war have taken an enormous toll as, Ben, and all of our colleagues have reported on Yemeni civilians, 7 million people, a quarter of the population are on the brink of starvation.</p><p>Many of them are young children. Our Clarissa Ward obtained rare access to Yemen. She has this exclusive report. You should know the video is disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is how Ahmed Helmiz (ph) spends his days. Lying on the concrete floor, trying to swat away the flies with what little energy he has. Looking at his tiny body, ravaged by hunger, you would never guess that Ahmed is 5-years-old.</p><p>[08:15:00] His brother died of malnutrition two months ago. \"We're in a war, there's no food, no water,\" his mother Sumaya (ph) says. \"Only God knows our pain.\"</p><p>It's a pain shared by too many here. In the same small village, we meet Abdul Rahman (ph), an overwhelmed father of five. He's worried about his son Abdul Rahab (ph). There's no doctor nearby and no scale.</p><p>But he can't weigh more than five pounds. \"The problem is that my wife doesn't have a lot of breast milk,\" he says. \"She's sick, too.\" And it's not hard to see why. There's almost no food in it.</p><p>(On camera): (Speaking Foreign Language). So, they have some bread. (Speaking Foreign Language)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking Foreign Language).</p><p>WARD: Some onions. (Speaking Foreign Language).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking Foreign Language).</p><p>WARD: No meat.</p><p>(Voice-over): Hunger has always been a problem in Yemen, but two and a half years of war has starved the country. Three million people are displaced. Many live in filthy camps where disease and infection are rife and malnutrition difficult to combat.</p><p>There is food in the markets. It's just that few people can actually afford it. And that's what's so tough to get your head around about this crisis. It's not caused by a bad harvest or a drought. It's caused by man.</p><p>A Saudi Arabia-led blockade has cut the amount of food and medicine getting into Yemen by more than half. What does come through, is heavily taxed along the way. Rural clinics struggle to meet the scale of the need.</p><p>Ten-month-old Ali has gained seven ounces since his last visit, a welcome improvement, but he is still suffering from severe malnutrition.</p><p>\"You haven't done anything wrong,\" the nurse tells his mother. \"But he's still weak. So, I really want you to focus on this problem.\"</p><p>For Ahmed (ph), it may be too late. He's been sick for years now. He only speaks when the pain is too much. \"He tells me, my tummy hurts, my head hurts,\" Sumaya (ph) she says. \"He cries.\"</p><p>Hardship and hunger, this is Yemen's story. \"My whole life, agony and I are like lovers,\" this Yemeni song goes. \"Why, world, do you only show us the terrible things?\"</p><p>But the world doesn't hear his lament, while the silence of starvation tightens its grip on a forgotten people. Clarissa Ward, CNN, Lahej Province, Yemen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Thanks to, Clarissa, for that very powerful report. Now, the internet as we now know it could be about to change. U.S. regulators have voted to repeal net neutrality rules.</p><p>That means internet providers would be allowed to slow down access to certain apps and websites as they see fit. Now the White House says it supports the change, while tech companies like, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix are vowing to fight it.</p><p>Now much of the debate around net neutrality centers around what's considered a fair and open internet. Well CNN spoke to Andrew Lippman, co- director of the M.I.T. Media Lab.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW LIPPMAN, CO-DIRECTOR, M.I.T. MEDIA LAB: With respect to the discussions that are going on in the United States, I think it's a great pity that we didn't trademark the word internet, so that no one could confuse the open, free access associated with the internet with any other way of delivering information to people.</p><p>In particular to distinguish between restrictive cable-like versions of communications and the open internet. My biggest regret is that we didn't simply trademark the term so that no one could call these options that aren't neutral an internet because they're not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CURNOW: OK. So the vote by the FCC affects how the internet is regulated in the U.S. but what does that mean for net users in the rest of the world? Lippman, gave his take on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIPPMAN: It's true that there are a lot of places in the world where neutrality of this sort is not really an issue. It's a given. It's taken for granted and the internet is opened and used by everybody.</p><p>But the United States is big and sometimes a bit ahead of the curve and so sometimes a lot of places in the world follow the lead of the United States.</p><p>And it's most concerning in the developing world, not in the highly developed first world, where sometimes there are alternatives.</p><p>[08:20:00] And sometimes people can even work with the government to come out with a pretty good solution. But in the emerging world, we really do care that that world joins the future in a way that promotes the best possible outcome for all of the people in the world.</p><p>Not just the corporations, not just one partisan entity. It's a pity that these things dominate the discussion, but that it be for the benefit of society as a whole.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CURNOW: So what can people outside the U.S. do if they are concerned about the future of the internet? Here's what, Lippman, had to say about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIPPMAN: Well, it seems like the front line of the battle is here. And this is the place where it's most opened to discussion and 300 million people have sent notes to the FCC to be concern about it.</p><p>So I would love to see that to become an international cause and an international uprising. In the rest of the world, I think one of the things that we can do that's not so easy to do here is where there are places that lack the robust infrastructure.</p><p>We can attempt a lot of technical options that prevent the centrally controlled single infrastructure that can potentially intrude on your freedom of access and freedom of communication, we have the potential to prevent that from existing at all. And we should devote more energy to that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CURNOW: Andrew Lippman there, co-director of the M.I.T. Media Lab. Now the net neutrality appeal isn't set to take effect until next year. So the issue could -- could end up in the courts.</p><p>And still ahead here at CNN, a disturbing report on child sex abuse at state and religious institutions in Australia. What investigators say needs to change to stop the abuse once and for all. We have a live report from Rome.</p><p>CURNOW: Welcome back. I'm Robyn Curnow. You are watching CNN. And in Australia, a five-year investigation into child sex abuse at state and religious institutions estimates tens of thousands of children have been abused.</p><p>Now that final report is making dozens of recommendations, including several focused on the Catholic Church. One calls for an end to mandatory celibacy for catholic priests. Nearly one in ten Catholic priests in Australia stand accused of abuse inside religious institutions.</p><p>Well, joining me from Rome is John Allen, he is a senior Vatican analyst and editor of Crux, an independent website covering Catholicism. John, one in ten Catholic priests in Australia is now accused of inside religious institutions. It's staggering.</p><p>JOHN ALLEN, EDITOR, CRUX: Oh, no question, Robyn, it is a staggering number.</p><p>[08:25:00] And it's reminiscent, of course, of the findings of the John Jay (ph) Commission in the United States that examined the pattern of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in the United States in 2002, 2003, 2004.</p><p>You know, which found that somewhere between four percent and seven percent of all American priest over the last 50 years or so have had credible allegations of sexual abuse against them. I mean what it demonstrates is that this isn't one off or random problem.</p><p>But it is a massive systemic failure in the Catholic Church to adequately diagnose, prevent or respond to accusations of sexual abuse when they occur. And I suspect you will find that on that front, there is not going to be any pushback from the Catholic Church on that aspect of the Royal Commission report.</p><p>I think this is something the church has known for a while, but debate it's not whether the problem is real, but whether the church has done enough to respond to it.</p><p>CURNOW: That's the point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ALLEN: Now when it comes to other aspects...</p><p>CURNOW: This certainly pushed back and tried to make some difference but it's at seven percent in Australian on average and seven percent of catholic priest in the U.S. from previous report, we can assume that this continues and children are still vulnerable.</p><p>ALLEN: Well listen, Robyn, I mean the Catholic Church today is in a very different place in dealing with this than it was a decade ago when these reports first began to surface in the United States.</p><p>I mean today, zero tolerance is the law of the land in the Catholic Church. The Catholic priest is incredibly accused of abuse, that guy is going to be removed from ministry immediately. He is going to be reported to the cops and consequences will descend on him like a ton of bricks.</p><p>The problem in the Catholic Church today really isn't, in terms of responding to accusations against priests, the problem in the Catholic Church is what about bishops who covered it up, bishops who dropped the ball.</p><p>You know, that's where the work still has to be done. If I may say, you know, one of the issues about the royal commission report is that if they - - if they had highlighted that issue, that is accountably, not just for the rank and file but for the hierarchy, I think they would have gotten overwhelming Catholic support.</p><p>Now when they start going after things like priest to the celibacy, and one thing you did not mentioned, they also recommended eating away at the seal of the confessional.</p><p>Those are much more controversial issues, quite frankly are unlikely to ever happen, and I think to some extent, the risk here is the royal commission has muddied the waters between what is legitimate and achievable reform. And what isn't.</p><p>CURNOW: So what you say is that there is no way the Vatican is going to listen to the Aussies here. This is going to be put aside and their no way is they are going to change hundreds and hundreds of years of Catholic traditions when it comes to celibacy and traditional confessional.</p><p>So what could be done and what can be done is, it's going to be done. The Vatican is acutely aware of what needs to be done here.</p><p>ALLEN: Listen, I mean, what needs to be done is so obvious, Robyn, a blind person can see it. I mean what it comes down to is, what we know now is that the Catholic Church has strong accountability measures for priests who abuse.</p><p>The problem is that those procedures are not uniform. They are extremely strong and effective in places like the United States and part of Europe, Canada, even today in Australia, where the crisis has been so massive that the church has been compelled to respond. They are not uniform in other parts of the world.</p><p>And that has to happen. And it has to happen now. The other problem we have is that we do not have equally strong ability for bishops who drop the ball.</p><p>You know, if you are a bishop and you are informed of a report of child sexual abuse against one of your clergy, and you don't report that to the police, you don't take steps to take that priest out of ministry, right now we have no effective procedure that would ensure that that bishop has to suffer consequences that are not nearly symbolic but real.</p><p>Those are fixes that everyone knows have to put in place and that are realistic to expect the Catholic Church might actually adopt. I think what critics of this royal commission report will say, is that if you would focus on those things, you might have produced real change.</p><p>By focusing on priestly celibacy and the seal of the confessional, I mean in effect, Robyn -- you know, when it comes to the seal of the confessional to say that the Catholic Church ought to eliminate that is like saying that Islam ought to get rid of the Koran or the Judaism out to get rid of its special identification of the land of Israel. Those are interesting ideas. But they are never going to happen. And so this is wasted energy and I think some critics may say that this was, because of that, a missed opportunity to promote the case for real achievable change.</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, CNN HOST AND CORRESPONDENT: Pragmatic, practical examples. And also the point is when you talk about uniformity, where is the Catholic church growing? Latin America, Africa, some parts of Asia, and that is potentially where there is no oversight in the way that you see perhaps in Australia or in the U.S. after these reports.</p><p>John Allen, always good to speak to you. Thanks so much coming to us live there from Rome.</p><p>Still ahead, U.S. lawmakers, Republican lawmakers are sprinting towards a tax reform vote before the Christmas recess. It could be a huge victory for President Trump, but there are new signs that it might not come so easily.</p><p>CURNOW: I'm Robyn Curnow. You are watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines. Protesters are taking to the streets in the cities across the Middle East. It was just over a week ago that U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. These pictures from Jordanian television show thousands of people gathering in Amman in protest.</p><p>The British prime minister has thanked E.U. leaders after block gave the green light to start the next stage of Brexit talks. Speaking after meetings in Brussels, Theresa May says the decision is an important step in ensuring smooth and orderly Brexit, but the E.U. won't set guidelines on final trade negotiations until March.</p><p>And some happy news just into us. We now have a date for Prince Harry's wedding with Meghan Markle. Kensington Palace has confirmed they will tie the knot on May 19th next year. The couple had said earlier they will get married sometime next May. There you go, put it in your diary, May 19th.</p><p>And U.S. President Donald Trump is applauding Disney's $52 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. The White House says the president congratulated Fox co-chairman Rupert Murdoch with the sale. But big questions remain about the blockbuster deal such as, what role Murdoch's son, James, would play? He is currently the CEO of 21st Century Fox.</p><p>President Trump is hoping to sign a Republican tax bill into law before Christmas.</p><p>[08:35:00] Congressional leaders are planning to unveil their final version in the coming hours, but as Jeff Zeleny now reports, the bill has hit some unexpected snags.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: OK. One, two, three --</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Trump grabbed a pair of golden scissors today at a White House photo opportunity on cutting regulations. But beyond his smiles tonight, deep questions remain over the prospects of the signature Republican tax plan.</p><p>TRUMP: I think we will get there. It will be in a very short period of time. It will be the greatest Christmas present that lot of people have ever received. It will be something special.</p><p>ZELENY (voice over): The $1.5 trillion tax plan is in its final stages, but still not over the finish line as the White House and Republican leaders scramble to ease last-minute skepticism. At the Capitol, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida made a bombshell announcement, saying he will vote \"no\" on the GOP's tax plan unless it expands the child tax credit. He is the second Republican senator to voice his opposition. The president downplayed the concerns.</p><p>TRUMP: I think he'll get there. He's really been a great guy and very supportive. I think that Senator Rubio will be there.</p><p>ZELENY (voice over): But that confidence from the president was not reflected in the raw map of the Senate. Two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Thad Cochran of Mississippi, are both ill. They have been away from the Capitol all week, making other Republican votes even more critical.</p><p>With with the razor thin margin in the Senate, Vice President Pence said today he would delay a trip to the Middle East until next week so he will be on hand to break a tie if needed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president asked the House and Senate to stay here in Washington and finish this bill even if it means leading into the Christmas holiday.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We are pretty confident that we are going to get there before then, but this is something that I think both the House, the Senate and the president are all committed to seeing it happen. We are very hopeful that it will take place the first of next week.</p><p>ZELENY (voice over): The White House is making tentative plans for the president to sign the bill into law before leaving for his holiday break at Mar-a-Lago. He has told aides he wants to sign what would be his biggest legislative achievement in the east room, which is festooned in Christmas decorations.</p><p>But the plan still needs another vote in the House and Senate. The latest version set to be announced Friday is expected to lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lower the top individual rate to 37 percent, and repeal the individual mandate in Obamacare.</p><p>But concerns still hang over the bill, particularly whether it has more benefits for the rich or middle class Americans. A key sticking point, when the tax cut for individual would expire, 2025 or even earlier. All this amid new questions over Speaker Paul Ryan's future. Some of his close friends tell CNN he's had soul searching conversations about how long he may serve as the leader of the house Republicans.</p><p>At the White House, those reports caused alarm. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president reached out to Ryan, one of his closest partners on Capitol Hill.</p><p>SANDERS: Made sure that the speaker knew very clearly in no uncertain terms that if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it.</p><p>ZELENY: That phone call from President Trump to Speaker Ryan indicates the fact that they are close partners. They have, indeed, worked on legislation throughout the year. This tax plan is a key example of that. The president pushing for a vote on that in the coming days. He would like to sign that bill into law, which would be the biggest legislative achievement of his first year in office. He hopes to do that by Wednesday, but before then, many hurdles need to be crossed.</p><p>Jeff Zeleny, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Thanks to Jeff for that report. Now, still ahead here on CNN, a show of force for the \"The Last Jedi.\" Fans and critics alike praise the latest \"Star Wars\" film.</p><p>[08:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW: You would have to be living in a galaxy far, far away not to notice that the new \"Star Wars\" film is out. \"The Last Jedi\" has just hit theaters in North America and beyond to the likes of dedicated fans. One if them, Frank Pallotta is joining us now from New York. You are standing outside of movie theater in the cold. And I understand you have seen the movie. What did you think? Hi, Frank.</p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNNMONEY MEDIA REPORTER: I saw the movie on Monday. It's a very fun movie. The original movie came out in May of 1977. And right now standing outside in about 20-degree weather, I wished these movies still open in the summer.</p><p>But there is a huge crowd inside of the AMC Lincoln Square in upper west side of Manhattan. We went inside just a little while ago. The first screening for the movie is already playing. It's completely sold out. It was an 8:00 a.m. showing. It has as you said, a huge show of force for this movie this weekend.</p><p>CURNOW: Also, I mean, the stakes for this movie have been high, particularly because the last film broke records. Could this be making movie history?</p><p>PALLOTTA: It could come close. The original of the last movie \"Star Wars,\" \"The Force Awakens,\" which came out two Decembers ago, was the biggest domestic opening of all time at $248 million. People, analysts in Hollywood are projecting that this is probably going to be closer to 200 to maybe even as high as 220. So it will be probably the second biggest opening for a movie ever only behind itself, which is \"Star Wars\" \"The Force Awakens.\"</p><p>CURNOW: OK. Let's talk about all of the films. I mean, fans had to wait a decade for \"Force Awakens.\" now, we have three \"Star Wars\" films in three years, two more coming. I mean, is it a dark question, but is that just too much \"Star Wars\"?</p><p>PALLOTTA: I don't think there is ever enough \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>CURNOW: I knew you'd answer it like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PALLOTTA: -- \"Star Wars\" enthusiast. I mean, you are really asking the right guy. Is there such a thing as too much sunshine or joy in the world? I don't know. But I do understand that to a certain extent, we are going to have another movie, which is a Hans solo prequel in the summer.</p><p>And then you're going to get about a year and a half between the next movie and then Episode Nine, which is going to be the sequel to the movie coming out.</p><p>These movies have made $2 billion worldwide for \"Force Awakens,\" a billion dollars for \"Rogue One,\" and this one is probably going to come close to $1.5 billion worldwide as well. So, people aren't getting tired of this necessarily and Disney has shown that it really has a good grip on this franchise.</p><p>CURNOW: OK. Thanks, Frank Pallotta. As always, great speaking to you. Enjoy. Warm up. So, that's \"News Stream.\" Thanks so much for watching. I'm Robyn Curnow sitting in for Kristie Lu Stout. Don't go anywhere. \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is next. Enjoy.</p><p>[08:45:00] (WORLD SPORT)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017121501cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R65-FKC1-DXH2-6336-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 15, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Israel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerusalem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yemen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyber Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Catholic Church</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sexual Abuse</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Child Sex Abuse</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brexit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>21st Century Fox</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disney</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Royal Wedding</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Bill</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Movie</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Abuse, Endangerment &amp;

Americans are taxed to provide federal education funding, ostensibly for the education of their children and others, but the money goes to finance public schools regardless of whether those students end up attending them. If families choose to homeschool or send their children to private schools, the taxpayer money marked for their child's education still goes to the public school, and the family is left to cover the actual cost of their kids' schooling on their own. This means that in many cases, low-income families have no choice but to send their children to public schools, even if those very schools are failing their students. </p><p>The broken system for the allocation of federal education funds was already a problem before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to that crisis and sweeping government restrictions, many public schools will remain closed for in-person learning this fall. Some families who have been forced to rely on these schools simply cannot work and pay their bills without the crucial childcare services that go along with educational programs, and their personal circumstances may be such that draconian COVID-19 avoidance efforts are not necessary nor warranted. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, just unveiled a new bill[1] that would help give parents and students the flexibility to choose the learning environment that's right for their family\u2014by ensuring that the distribution of federal funds lets them do so.Empower parents. Help students. Support their choices and needs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/p7d6xg3VcI\">https://t.co/p7d6xg3VcI</url>[2]\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) August 5, 2020[3]The SCHOOL Act[4] would alter the structure of federal education funding to allow the allotted taxpayer dollars to follow any given student regardless of whether their family chooses homeschool, private school, or public school. The money could still only be used for proper educational expenses, but this way, the funding would flow to whatever's best for the student\u2014which is supposed to be the point\u2014not end up in the coffers of public schools by default. 'If the government schools decide not to meet in person in the fall, I think every parent should have the right to take their tax dollars to the school of their choice,' Paul wrote in an op-ed[5] accompanying his bill's rollout. 'The choices would include homeschool, the local public school or another public school that has in-person classes, or a private or parochial school. It's hard to imagine why anyone would oppose letting parents decide the school of their choice.'Let's empower low income students and families with freedom of choice. The Obamas chose private school over DC public. Why can't you? <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /dKSd2wDFIi[6]\u2014 Kelley Paul (@KelleyAshbyPaul) August 5, 2020[7]Paul's bill provides a partial solution to a serious problem plaguing American families amid the current COVID-19 crisis. Some parents are desperate for their kids to go back to school, and have no one in their household who is at risk for COVID-19. (For children, the disease has almost a 0 percent mortality rate. For adults under 40 with no preexisting conditions, the death rate is very low as well.) Keeping their money stuck in a public school system that isn't opening this fall isn't reasonable. These families should be able to take the funding our government has allocated for their child's education and put it toward homeschooling solutions (like the 'pandemic pods[8]' that are sprouting up) or a private school that has decided to reopen, if that's what they feel is best. Yet other families may very reasonably decide to not send their kids to any in-person program. They might not feel comfortable with the risks, or they may have an elderly or immuno-compromised person in their household and fear that COVID-19 exposure could have grave consequences. For that family, remote learning is the right decision. The great thing about Paul's proposed system is that it supports families in both situations, and empowers them to decide for themselves.This  just in: @RandPaul[9] actually thinks we should decide what to do with our own money. Especially if most parents are having to homeschool their kids this year \u200d\ufe0f <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /AhUgYdqa3c[10]\u2014 Antonia Okafor Cover (@antonia_okafor) August 5, 2020[11]This aspect is key, because as economic philosopher Friedrich Hayek explained, there is a 'knowledge problem' that dooms centralized planning[12] and top-down government efforts. Government bureaucrats simply aren't familiar enough with the wildly different conditions in differing parts of the country under COVID-19 or the vastly disparate situations different families are in to decide what's right for every student and school. They can't make decisions for the entire country with any degree of competence. Yet if empowered, families can make the right decisions for themselves. Of course, Rand Paul's bill only affects federal funds, and most education money is funded at the state and local level. So, the SCHOOLS Act alone can't completely deliver us an education system that works for students\u2014but it can certainly take us a large step in the right direction.

It concludes that while some of the concerns being raised have merit, the net effect of rising support for policies designed to rein in technology with bans, taxes, or stringent regulations would be to reduce individual and societal welfare.</p><p>\u201cTechlash has created a mob mentality, and the mob is coming for innovation,\u201d said ITIF President Robert D. Atkinson, the report\u2019s lead co-author. \u201cGiving into techlash passions would slow down economic and wage growth, reduce national competitiveness, and limit progress on a host of critical societal priorities. Rather than techlash, we need a pragmatic \u2018tech realism,\u2019 recognizing that today\u2019s technologies, like virtually all past technologies, are a fundamental force for human progress. To be sure, they can pose real challenges in some instances, and those deserve smart and effective responses.\u201d</p><p>Among the 22 discrete techlash-related issues that Atkinson and a team of ITIF analysts delved into, there were 16 societal issues\u2014from fears that social media is harmful for children to claims that technology is leading to pervasive surveillance\u2014plus six economic issues, including claims that technology is driving income inequality and that it is giving rise to monopolies. The report acknowledges that some of these issues are complex and deserve detailed and thorough policy responses.</p><p>\u201cThe question is not whether technology has costs, but whether the costs can be managed sensibly and are outweighed by the benefits. The answer on both counts is, unquestionably, yes,\u201d said Atkinson. \u201cWe should not go back to the na\u00efve, utopian era of worshipping IT as our savior. But swinging to the other extreme of techlash isn\u2019t warranted either. We should instead critically examine the impact of new technology so we can deterimine how to maximize its value and limit harms.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2556314</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD2-FK11-F0YC-N297-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPH2</classCode><className>WAGE GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp; SALARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FYE</classCode><className>SCIENCE POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00096UR</classCode><className>INCOME DISTRIBUTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Watches, fitness bands, and so-called \"smart\" clothing, linked to apps and mobile devices, are part of a growing \"connected-health\" system in the U.S., promising to provide people with more efficient ways to manage their own health. The report, Health Wearable Devices in the Big Data Era: Ensuring Privacy, Security, and Consumer Protection, found that the weak and fragmented health[1]-privacy regulatory system fails to provide adequate federal laws to safeguard personal health[2] information collected by wearables. </p><p>The report provides an overview and analysis of the major features, key players, and trends that are shaping the new consumer-wearable and connected-health marketplace. \"Many of these devices are already being integrated into a growing Big Data digital health and marketing ecosystem, which is focused on gathering and monetizing personal and health data[3] in order to influence consumer behavior,\" the report explains. As the use of these devices becomes more widespread, and as their functionalities become increasingly sophisticated, \"the extent and nature of data collection[4] will be unprecedented.\" The report documents a number of current digital health marketing practices that threaten the privacy of consumer health information, including \"condition targeting,\" \"look-alike modeling,\" predictive analytics, \"scoring,\" and the real-time buying and selling of individual consumers. The technology of wearable devices makes them particularly powerful tools for data collection and digital marketing. The report also explains how an emerging set of techniques and Big-Data practices are being developed to harness the unique capabilities of wearables\u2014such as biosensors that track bodily functions, and \"haptic technology\" that enables users to \"feel\" actual body sensations. Pharmaceutical companies are poised to be among the major beneficiaries of wearable marketing. The report offers suggestions for how government, industry, philanthropy, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions can work together to develop a comprehensive approach to health privacy and consumer protection in the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things. These include:Clear, enforceable standards for both the collection and use of information; Formal processes for assessing the benefits and risks of data use; and Stronger regulation of direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies. \"The connected-health system is still in an early, fluid stage of development,\" explained Kathryn C. Montgomery, Professor of Communication with American University,and a co-author of the report. \"There is an urgent need to build meaningful, effective, and enforceable safeguards into its foundation.\" Such efforts \"will require moving beyond the traditional focus on protecting individual privacy, and extending safeguards to cover a range of broader societal goals, such as ensuring fairness, preventing discrimination, and promoting equity,\" the report says. \"In the wake of the recent election, the United States is on the eve of a major public debate over the future of its health-care system,\" the report notes. \"The potential of personal digital devices to reduce health-care spending will likely play an important role,\" as lawmakers deliberate the fate of the Affordable Care Act. However, unless there are adequate regulatory safeguards in place, \"consumers and patients could face serious risks to their privacy and security, and also be subjected to discrimination and other harms.\" \"Americans now face a growing loss of their most sensitive information, as their health data are collected and analyzed on a continuous basis, combined with information about their finances, ethnicity, location, and online and off-line behaviors,\" said Jeff Chester, Executive Director of the Center for Digital Democracy, also a co-author of the report. \"Policy makers must act decisively to protect consumers in today's Big Data era.\" The three authors of the report[5] \u2014Kathryn Montgomery, Jeff Chester, and Katharina Kopp\u2014have played a leading role on digital privacy issues, and were responsible for the campaign during the 1990s that led to enactment by Congress of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

As lives become increasingly intertwined and dependent on Facebook and Google's technologies, users are forced to pay for these \"free\" services with their intimate personal data, which is constantly tracked and collected.</p><p> \"The Internet is vital for people to enjoy many of their rights, yet billions of people have no meaningful choice but to access this public space on terms dictated by Facebook and Google,\" Naidoo said.</p><p> \"To make it worse this isn't the Internet people signed up for when these platforms started out. Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped. Either we must submit to this pervasive surveillance machinery \u2013 where our data is easily weaponized to manipulate and influence us \u2013 or forego the benefits of the digital world. This can never be a legitimate choice. We must reclaim this essential public square, so we can participate without having our rights abused.\"</p><p> The Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which private information from Facebook users was harvested and then used by Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, shows that information mined for nefarious purposes is the same data used to generate personalized advertisement experiences by Facebook and Google. The companies' complex algorithms exist to aid advertisers in strategically marketing users.</p><p> Personalization also means the catering of users' experiences towards their ideological interests. The report finds that Facebook and Google's algorithms are designed to \"nudge people towards particular outcomes based on an individual's unique personal characteristics.\"</p><p> These algorithms are said to take away personal autonomy through distraction and constant bombardment and manufacture actions and beliefs in such a way that they pose a threat to people's right to think freely without coercion.</p><p> As such, Amnesty International has called for a \"new Internet\" in which governments take action to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect us from corporate human rights abuses by enforcing robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech in line with human rights law.</p><p> \"Facebook and Google must not be allowed to dictate how we live online,\" Naidoo said. \"These companies have chosen a specific surveillance-business model that impacts on privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights. The technology behind the Internet is not incompatible with our rights, but the business model Facebook and Google have chosen is.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has continuously insisted, most recently in front of a U.S. Congressional committee, that the data is collected and mined and sold to advertisers to pay towards the company's operating budget and for its profits. He has stated that collecting users' personal data is the only way to keep the social media service free.</p><p> The post New report shows Facebook and Google's pervasive surveillance poses threat to human rights appeared first on Arab American News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-e44e83224c43c7782d3b2987e576641e667ea39</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C519B87824A NWBKMI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKW-HPW1-JBCN-438T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Even the commonly known iHeart-Media group provides a platform for Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.</p><p>While its may appear that hate-groups have found a way to slip through loopholes in tech companies rules and regulation structures and have exploited proprietary algorithms to their own end, Bhatti argues that the situation is quite the opposite.</p><p>\"Facebook, in fact, has found a way to write its rules which makes these things okay,\" he said. \"If one looks at their fact checkers for instance, one fnds the Daily Caller, one of the biggest purveyors of fake information, particularly with White supremacist and anti-Muslim bias.</p><p>\"The bigger, overarching point is that these different platforms boast neutrality and try to give off this idea they merely provide a space for people to share their opinions. The truth is that these companies are not neutral. Their rules are crafted in such a way that actually creates these loopholes that are meant to be exploited.\"</p><p>Recently, a Twitter executive admitted that if it eliminated anti-Muslim content from its website the same way it has successfully eliminated ISIS-related content, it would alienate a lot more users and that any algorithm designed to catch White supremacist content would crowd out too many Republican lawmakers.</p><p>Bhatti pointed out that these major social media platforms have the ability to stamp out other troubling content, like child pornography, because they have made an effective effort. The companies fail to go after White supremacist content with the same amount of rigor.</p><p>The report recommends that the corporations must make amends for their past actions and invest the profts they have made from propagating bigotry to the communities that have faced violence, discrimination, and harassment as a result of their actions and that they must involve Muslim, Arab, South Asian and Black communities in developing policies that will ensure that these injustices are not repeated in the future.</p><p>It calls corporations like Google, Fidelity and News Corp the \"unindicted co-conspirators of the Christchurch shooter\" and that they should be held accountable for \"profting off a global fascist movement built on bigotry and fear.\"</p><p>These companies have state-of-the-art resources to clamp down on activity if they want to.

Even the commonly known iHeart-Media group provides a platform for Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.</p><p>While its may appear that hate-groups have found a way to slip through loopholes in tech companies rules and regulation structures and have exploited proprietary algorithms to their own end, Bhatti argues that the situation is quite the opposite.</p><p>\"Facebook, in fact, has found a way to write its rules which makes these things okay,\" he said. \"If one looks at their fact checkers for instance, one fnds the Daily Caller, one of the biggest purveyors of fake information, particularly with White supremacist and anti-Muslim bias.</p><p>\"The bigger, overarching point is that these different platforms boast neutrality and try to give off this idea they merely provide a space for people to share their opinions. The truth is that these companies are not neutral. Their rules are crafted in such a way that actually creates these loopholes that are meant to be exploited.\"</p><p>Recently, a Twitter executive admitted that if it eliminated anti-Muslim content from its website the same way it has successfully eliminated ISIS-related content, it would alienate a lot more users and that any algorithm designed to catch White supremacist content would crowd out too many Republican lawmakers.</p><p>Bhatti pointed out that these major social media platforms have the ability to stamp out other troubling content, like child pornography, because they have made an effective effort. The companies fail to go after White supremacist content with the same amount of rigor.</p><p>The report recommends that the corporations must make amends for their past actions and invest the profts they have made from propagating bigotry to the communities that have faced violence, discrimination, and harassment as a result of their actions and that they must involve Muslim, Arab, South Asian and Black communities in developing policies that will ensure that these injustices are not repeated in the future.</p><p>It calls corporations like Google, Fidelity and News Corp the \"unindicted co-conspirators of the Christchurch shooter\" and that they should be held accountable for \"profting off a global fascist movement built on bigotry and fear.\"</p><p>These companies have state-of-the-art resources to clamp down on activity if they want to. Their cost-beneft analysis is that they would rather make money off this particular type of content.</p><p>Saqib Bhatti,</p><p>co-executive director of ACRE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROQFT-2325703454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARAMNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRW-5SM1-JBHT-D0WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Arab American News Nov 9-Nov 15, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Arab American News, The</publicationName><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 1761</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000283S</classCode><className>CHARLES SCHWAB CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Their cost-benefit analysis is that they would rather make money off this particular type of content. \u2014 Saqib Bhatti, co-executive director of ACRE</p><p> It argues that Google-owned YouTube plays a key role in exposing young minds to White supremacist ideology through its \"autoplay\" function that enables quick access to recommended content that can take a user down the rabbit hole of racist ideology.</p><p>Amazon does its part by enabling its algorithm to point customers who search for White supremacist books to even more White supremacist propaganda.</p><p>Facebook lets anti-Muslim groups conduct fundraising efforts on its platforms, while Amazon directly funds hate by donating money to anti-Muslim organization like the Middle East Forum and the investigative Project on Terrorism.</p><p> \"These companies have state-of-the-art resources to clamp down on activity if they want to,\" Bhatti said. \"Their cost-benefit analysis is that they would rather make money off this particular type of content.\"</p><p> The report also finds that Wall Street firms like Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Goldman Sachs routinely aid large donations to hate groups by big donors through their financial mechanisms.</p><p> The Manhattan Institute, an influential right wing think tank, works with hedge fund managers and other prominent business leaders to effectively endorse anti-Muslim bigotry.</p><p> Further, right-wing media groups like Rupert Murdoch's News Corp make obvious culprits by spreading messages against immigrants and people of color through its subsidiaries Fox News and the New York Post. Even the commonly known iHeartMedia group provides a platform for Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.</p><p> While its may appear that hate-groups have found a way to slip through loopholes in tech companies rules and regulation structures and have exploited proprietary algorithms to their own end, Bhatti argues that the situation is quite the opposite.</p><p> \"Facebook, in fact, has found a way to write its rules which makes these things okay,\" he said. \"If one looks at their fact checkers for instance, one finds the Daily Caller, one of the biggest purveyors of fake information, particularly with White supremacist and anti-Muslim bias.</p><p> \"The bigger, overarching point is that these different platforms boast neutrality and try to give off this idea they merely provide a space for people to share their opinions. The truth is that these companies are not neutral. Their rules are crafted in such a way that actually creates these loopholes that are meant to be exploited.\"</p><p> Recently, a Twitter executive admitted that if it eliminated anti-Muslim content from its website the same way it has successfully eliminated ISIS-related content, it would alienate a lot more users and that any algorithm designed to catch White supremacist content would crowd out too many Republican lawmakers.</p><p> Bhatti pointed out that these major social media platforms have the ability to stamp out other troubling content, like child pornography, because they have made an effective effort. The companies fail to go after White supremacist content with the same amount of rigor.</p><p> The report recommends that the corporations must make amends for their past actions and invest the profits they have made from propagating bigotry to the communities that have faced violence, discrimination, and harassment as a result of their actions and that they must involve Muslim, Arab, South Asian and Black communities in developing policies that will ensure that these injustices are not repeated in the future.</p><p> It calls corporations like Google, Fidelity and News Corp the \"unindicted co-conspirators of the Christchurch shooter\" and that they should be held accountable for \"profiting off a global fascist movement built on bigotry and fear.\"</p><p> The post New report shows how tech companies profit from anti-Muslim violence and bigotry  appeared first on Arab American News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-51b4dddb18e6c3c8ae801c6ba5a098a04b61cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C519B87824A NWBKMI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG8-1K41-DXVP-V2NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The report provides a detailed analysis of new opportunities for growth and capturing a new generation of customers made possible by this shift.   The report highlights the impact of status quo of business models used for decades and the 50-year-long decline in life insurance ownership, but outlines the opportunity to reverse course based on the high level of interest in life insurance and voluntary benefits by the Millennial and Gen Z generations. In this new digital era, new expectations for a broader health, wealth and wellness focus will pressure insurers to develop products and services that are more affordable, tailored to very specific needs, digital-first, simpler, and grounded in trust. Customer needs, expectations and demands will create demand for new, digital products like on-demand, single-item and embedded coverages, value-added services, and more, that are bundled in a way to help customers manage their lives.    \u201c Today\u2019s customers are increasingly digitally adept, with higher expectations, different needs and a demand for better experiences that are not met with the \u2018traditional\u2019 insurance approach, creating a fault line between customers\u2019 expectations and insurers\u2019 ability to deliver. This fault line is what this year\u2019s consumer research for life insurance has identified and detailed in this report,\u201d stated Denise Garth, SVP of Strategic Marketing, Industry Relations and Innovation at Majesco. \u201c The survey results in this report clearly indicate that customers want a relationship with a broader value to make their lives better across life, health, wealth and lifestyle needs.\u201d    Life insurers must reimagine the scope of what they offer to customers. They must think of it as a compelling customer experience that is wrapped around a risk product and value-added services that are part of a broader health, wealth and wellness ecosystem. This is where exciting new business opportunities await, and where new competitors are emerging. Insurers have a choice of whether or not they are simply going to be product providers within an ecosystem that is developed outside of themselves, or whether they want to own the customer relationship and set the standard for an ecosystem where they operate as the core.    The research highlights generational differences between Millennials and Gen Z versus Gen X and Boomers on their views of life insurance and the shift to a holistic view for health, wealth and wellness including:    Millennials and Gen Z believe life insurance is more important \u2013 79% as compared to 69% for Gen X and Boomers. They also have a larger array of reasons why life insurance is important; many driven by new behaviors and needs.  Millennials and Gen Z are willing to share their personal information and data up to 39% more than the older generations.  Millennials &amp; Gen Z outpace Gen X and Boomers in wanting access to all health, wealth and wellness areas by up to 33% or more  Millennials and Gen Z seek information and advice for a variety of areas: Health, Financial Planning, Legal, Tax, Mortgage loads, bank balances, etc.  The younger generations want access to their information such as policies, medical records, fitness data, and household purchases, reflecting a strong interest in value added services.  Millennials and Gen Z are open to a broader array of channels, including big tech like Amazon, Apple and Google.

The report provides a detailed analysis of new opportunities for growth and capturing a new generation of customers made possible by this shift.</p><p><br/><br/>The report highlights the impact of status quo of business models used for decades and the 50-year-long decline in life insurance ownership, but outlines the opportunity to reverse course based on the high level of interest in life insurance and voluntary benefits by the Millennial and Gen Z generations. In this new digital era, new expectations for a broader health, wealth and wellness focus will pressure insurers to develop products and services that are more affordable, tailored to very specific needs, digital-first, simpler, and grounded in trust. Customer needs, expectations and demands will create demand for new, digital products like on-demand, single-item and embedded coverages, value-added services, and more, that are bundled in a way to help customers manage their lives.<br/><br/>'Today's customers are increasingly digitally adept, with higher expectations, different needs and a demand for better experiences that are not met with the 'traditional' insurance approach, creating a fault line between customers' expectations and insurers' ability to deliver. This fault line is what this year's consumer research for life insurance has identified and detailed in this report,' stated Denise Garth, SVP of Strategic Marketing, Industry Relations and Innovation at Majesco. 'The survey results in this report clearly indicate that customers want a relationship with a broader value to make their lives better across life, health, wealth and lifestyle needs.'<br/><br/>Life insurers must reimagine the scope of what they offer to customers. They must think of it as a compelling customer experience that is wrapped around a risk product and value-added services that are part of a broader health, wealth and wellness ecosystem. This is where exciting new business opportunities await, and where new competitors are emerging. Insurers have a choice of whether or not they are simply going to be product providers within an ecosystem that is developed outside of themselves, or whether they want to own the customer relationship and set the standard for an ecosystem where they operate as the core.<br/><br/>The research highlights generational differences between Millennials and Gen Z versus Gen X and Boomers on their views of life insurance and the shift to a holistic view for health, wealth and wellness including:<br/><br/>Millennials and Gen Z believe life insurance is more important - 79% as compared to 69% for Gen X and Boomers. They also have a larger array of reasons why life insurance is important; many driven by new behaviors and needs.<br/><br/>Millennials and Gen Z are willing to share their personal information and data up to 39% more than the older generations.<br/><br/>Millennials  Gen Z outpace Gen X and Boomers in wanting access to all health, wealth and wellness areas by up to 33% or more<br/><br/>Millennials and Gen Z seek information and advice for a variety of areas: Health, Financial Planning, Legal, Tax, Mortgage loads, bank balances, etc.<br/><br/>The younger generations want access to their information such as policies, medical records, fitness data, and household purchases, reflecting a strong interest in value added services.<br/><br/>Millennials and Gen Z are open to a broader array of channels, including big tech like Amazon, Apple and Google.<br/><br/>The thought leadership report is available to download on the Majesco website, or you can request a copy by emailing <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@majesco.com\">info@majesco.com</email><br/><br/>About Majesco<br/><br/>Majesco (NASDAQ: MJCO) provides technology, expertise, and leadership that helps insurers modernize, innovate and connect to build the future of their business - and the future of insurance - at speed and scale.

The report provides a detailed analysis of new opportunities for growth and capturing a new generation of customers made possible by this shift.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report highlights the impact of status quo of business models used for decades and the 50-year-long decline in life insurance ownership, but outlines the opportunity to reverse course based on the high level of interest in life insurance and voluntary benefits by the Millennial and Gen Z generations. In this new digital era, new expectations for a broader health, wealth and wellness focus will pressure insurers to develop products and services that are more affordable, tailored to very specific needs, digital-first, simpler, and grounded in trust. Customer needs, expectations and demands will create demand for new, digital products like on-demand, single-item and embedded coverages, value-added services, and more, that are bundled in a way to help customers manage their lives.</p><p>\"Today's customers are increasingly digitally adept, with higher expectations, different needs and a demand for better experiences that are not met with the 'traditional' insurance approach, creating a fault line between customers' expectations and insurers' ability to deliver. This fault line is what this year's consumer research for life insurance has identified and detailed in this report,\" stated Denise Garth, SVP of Strategic Marketing, Industry Relations and Innovation at Majesco. \"The survey results in this report clearly indicate that customers want a relationship with a broader value to make their lives better across life, health, wealth and lifestyle needs.\"</p><p>Life insurers must reimagine the scope of what they offer to customers. They must think of it as a compelling customer experience that is wrapped around a risk product and value-added services that are part of a broader health, wealth and wellness ecosystem. This is where exciting new business opportunities await, and where new competitors are emerging. Insurers have a choice of whether or not they are simply going to be product providers within an ecosystem that is developed outside of themselves, or whether they want to own the customer relationship and set the standard for an ecosystem where they operate as the core.</p><p>The research highlights generational differences between Millennials and Gen Z versus Gen X and Boomers on their views of life insurance and the shift to a holistic view for health, wealth and wellness including:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Millennials and Gen Z believe life insurance is more important - 79% as compared to 69% for Gen X and Boomers.

Grail conducted asurvey of 1,000 US consumersto find out how people feel about some of the practices and behaviors of six tech giants:Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Uber.</p><p>Americans are concerned about how these companies handle personal information and how their size and influence limits competition and innovation. For example, 71% are concerned about how Facebook handles personal data. 49% say Amazon intentionally stifles competition and 41% say the same about Apple.</p><p>However, even though Americans have concerns, most do not support breaking up these companies. When asked their level of agreement with the statement: \"Because of the way Facebook limits competition and uses personal information, government should break up Facebook,\"only 34% agreed.</p><p>In second place was Google with 25% agreeing that government should break it up, followed closely by Amazon at 24%, Uber and Apple at 22%, and Microsoft at 20%.</p><p>While people were generally averse to break-ups, they were more likely to agree that \"government should regulate\" Big Tech. Appetite for regulation was, on average, more than 10 percentage points higher than willingness to break up these companies.</p><p>With respect to breaks-ups, there were no significant differences between those who identify politically as Democrats, Republicans or Independents.</p><p>One problem with the \"Break Up Big Tech\" movement is that there are too many conflated arguments.

These powerhouses, shortened to the acronym FAANG, increasingly dominate not just our personal lives, but global markets and investment portfolios too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a few short years, it has become difficult to imagine life without Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflixand Google. These powerhouses, shortened to the acronym FAANG, increasingly dominate not just our personal lives, but global markets and investment portfolios too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A glance at the main US market, the S&amp;P 500, shows that Apple, Facebookand Googleoccupy three of the top four places by market capitalisation   the remaining position being occupied by Microsoft. That is on the back of several years of rapid share price appreciation. Excluding Apple, each of the FAANG stocks has risen by 100 per cent or more over the past half-decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lately, this enthusiasm has begun to be tempered. Technology indices have passed their dotcom era highs and the risk of greater regulation has grown.</p><p>Richard Clode, portfolio manager on the Janus Henderson global technology team, says:  Everything has performed well since the financial crisis, but tech has performed even better. The reason technology companies have managed to grow their earnings by 100 per cent in the last decade is [because] everything else hasn t grown. All of the outperformance of those technology stocks has been taking share of a lot of other sectors. </p><p>Mr Clode remains optimistic about the future of the sector, saying that Googlecan still grow its top line at 20 per cent a year, but plenty of fund selectors and generalist equity managers have become more cautious.</p><p>Fidelity multi-asset manager Bill McQuaker says:  We [have] added to an American equity fund which has lagged peers in recent months as a result of not owning key technology stocks. Technology stocks are where some of the riskiest behaviour has been seen, with investors displaying ever more faith in future expectations. </p><p>Tom Walker, manager of the Martin Currie Global Portfolio Trust, says:  We acknowledge the attractive business models of most of these stocks, but, in some cases, find the valuations too rich. </p><p>The manager holds Facebook, Apple and Chinese giant Alibaba nonetheless.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Winners keep winning&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>As Mr Clode outlines, equity markets have enjoyed a rich run of performance in recent years, with tech stocks a key driver.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Table 1&lt;/strong&gt; lists the top-performing technology funds and trusts over the past five years and makes for impressive reading. The Investment Association sector, numbering just 17 funds, has achieved average annual growth of 21.9 per cent over the period, bettered only by European and Japanese smaller companies funds.</p><p>Success has been maintained over every measured period, with average growth over 10 years falling just shy of 15 per cent. Allianz Technology trust is the best performing closed-ended vehicle, averaging 26.7 per cent over five years, including a 40 per cent increase in the past 12 months.</p><p>Fidelity s Global Technology fund leads the way in the open-ended space, turning out an average five-year growth rate of 24.3 per cent.</p><p>Ali Unwin, global technology fund manager at Neptune, says larger firms still present the best opportunity for future growth.</p><p>Mr Unwin says:  The size and scale of the tech behemoths is not an aberration, but a natural function of an increasingly digital economy. When the costs of distribution and transaction fall dramatically   as is the case with online businesses   we see an increasing tendency for winners to keep winning. </p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Bubble trouble&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>Those nervous about investing in technology point towards the infamous dotcom bubble, in which surging tech stock growth between 1997 and 2000 was followed by a market implosion. Such was the turnaround in fortunes that the Nasdaq composite index s climb from 1,000 points to more than 5,000 points in the boom period was completely reversed in less than two years.</p><p>HyunHo Sohn, manager of the Fidelity Global Technology fund, says:  Valuation comparisons with the dotcom bubble also must consider how the sector has changed in the interim. It is now far more global in nature, and less US-centric. Software and associated services, which benefit from steady, recurring revenue streams, are taking an ever-greater share of the market relative to more cyclical hardware and equipment companies. </p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Optimism or pessimism?&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>The risk of a pullback is not the only potential problem for the sector. Regulation is an ever-present obstacle for growth sectors, albeit a necessary one. Technology is no different. As more people manage their affairs online, including highly sensitive personal data, peace of mind that this information is protected becomes paramount. Wider global issues have also seen the technology sector come under close scrutiny.</p><p>Mr Clode says:  As tech becomes a bigger part of the economy, are we going to be able to protect the individual in terms of privacy? </p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Holding up&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>The traction gained by well-known tech companies such as the FAANG stocks has meant portfolios sway heavily towards US shares. Polar Capital Global Technology provides evidence as nearly two-thirds (65.5 per cent) of the fund is positioned in North American equities.</p><p>Given technology stocks  dominance of US indices, even those investors who do not seek dedicated funds in the space will likely have sizeable exposure to the sector. For those who do buy into technology as a theme, the preference is often for a fund sitting outside the Investment Association (IA) or Association of Investment Companies  Technology sectors.</p><p>In the past 12 months, net inflows into the IA s Technology and Telecoms sector stand at a paltry \u00a3140m. This is not necessarily because investors have grown cautious on the outlook for tech. Rather, they prefer to gain exposure elsewhere.</p><p>Witness the success of the Scottish Mortgage investment trust, for example: investors  continued backing of the trust saw it enter the FTSE 100 for the first time earlier this year. With seven of its top-10 holdings in the technology sector, there is no doubt it is this attribute most shareholders are backing.</p><p>Other investors  concerns for the sector focus on fund management rather than fund performance. A small number of stocks  increasing dominance of indices has left active managers with little choice but to hold weightings in some, if not all of the big tech players.</p><p>Consequently, critics have questioned the role of an active manager, suggesting that passive technology funds hold more or less the same stocks, but at substantially lower cost.</p><p>Hargreaves Lansdown removed tech funds from its Wealth 150 for this reason in August.</p><p> Over time, especially in a fast moving world, it still should be easy enough for active managers to beat these indexes and ultimately passives,  Mr Clode claims.</p><p>By its nature, the technology sector is well positioned to continue to capitalise on new developments. Come what may with regards to valuations, it will remain at the forefront of economic development.</p><p>As Mr Sohn explains, developments in the tech space provide good reason for big companies to keep getting bigger.</p><p> The development of future technologies like smart cars, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and 3D printing, makes for a very promising long-term investment backdrop,  he predicts.</p><p>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Limited</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MNYMGT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MNYMGT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PK4-Y7B1-DYX3-21P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">242795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Money Management</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33588\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 26, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 16th. Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus, blue chips Johnson &amp; Johnson and JPMorgan both reporting in the last hour. You can take a look at the performance of the stocks -- both beating expectations. Johnson &amp; Johnson has a slight gain there. JPMorgan down about 1.5 percent -- roughly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Issue there is JPMorgan going into this report that stock was up nearly 17 percent. That slight underperformance of the broad market and the financial sector, nevertheless investors were wanting more, clearly. Maybe that will change as the morning moves on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Later this hour, we hear from Goldman Sachs. You can take a look at the stock premarket right now. We'll have numbers and full analysis.</p><p>Let's check on your futures across the board. The Dow is now -- futures are now down 13 points, clearly pulled slightly lower by JPMorgan. The S&amp;P 500 lower as well. But this follows another day of records for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P, closing at fresh all-time highs yesterday.</p><p>In Europe, you have some buying to speak of in England and France, a slight loss on the Dax in Germany. And in Asia overnight, markets mixed. The Nikkei and Shanghai lower, the Hang Seng and Kospi in South Korea both moving up slightly.</p><p>Probing big tech, the Senate looking into Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency Libra, this as other lawmakers question leaders of big tech companies -- Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, asking if they pose a threat to competition.</p><p>And the 2020 race, billionaire investor and Trump supporter Peter Thiel says this is one Democratic presidential candidate he is most concerned about. Who is it and why? Find out ahead.</p><p>And Amazon Prime Day continues, the big sales event entering its second day. What it could mean for the stock and its competitors who are also running special deals.</p><p>Here to break it all down with me: pollster and Maslansky and Partners -- it's been too long -- she's the president and author of \"Persuasion\", the book. Lee Carter -- good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERs: Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Brewer Group CEO, former investment banker, former NFL star Jack Brewer; and Moody's capital market chief economist John Lonski. So much to discuss with these fantastic people. Good to see you -- John.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CAPITAL MARKET CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S: Same here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's nice to have you on the panel.</p><p>But Lee, let's talk about -- because we're watching these earnings and these are some big consumer companies, particularly JPMorgan says this -- I'll look at the headline. JPMorgan sees positive momentum with the U.S. consumer.</p><p>We're going to get retail sales out in about an hour and-a-half, a little bit less than that. But broadly speaking, the consumer is healthy. But this doesn't really dovetail with the narrative that the Democrats are crafting, going into 2020.</p><p>CARTER: You know, I think it's been fascinating to watch the Democrats' narrative on the economy. So last year we heard a lot about how it was -- you know, the economy was false, it was being propped up, it wasn't necessarily going to last.</p><p>And then as we're seeing that it's lasting, the recession isn't coming, we've seen a shift in the narrative. And what the narratives are now saying is, yes, the economy is strong but it's not strong for the American consumer, for the everyman.</p><p>It's helping companies. It's helping the wealthy, but it's not helping people like us. We saw that loud and clear when you look at the Democrat debate. So we're hearing that message continue. ` And yet, it's not being borne out and what we're hearing right now with Jamie Dimon was his talking about the positive momentum as you said, with the American consumer. In one interview after another talking about how the American consumer is strong.</p><p>You look at Gallup polling on consumer confidence right now. The momentum there continues to grow. We see people are more confident in the economy than we've seen in a long time. If you look back two years, three years ago, the numbers were nowhere near as high.</p><p>So what is the truth? Is the truth that the economy really is that strong or are the Democrats placing doubt when maybe there shouldn't be any?</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're really having to do some data mining to come up with quantitative evidence, I think, that the U.S. consumer is not benefiting from this very broad expansion. One of -- it's certainly the longest on record that we've seen.</p><p>But I want to point out with John, to Lee's point, here's a Greg Ip column from the Journal last week, a record expansion surprise winners -- the low- skilled.</p><p>As unemployment remains near generation lows. This is the lowest unemployment rate in my lifetime, or close to it, we're at 3.7 percent. I think the low of the cycle is 3.6 percent.</p><p>The fortunes of low wage workers have improved markedly, nonsupervisory employees' wages growing -- the wage is growing at the fastest pace in a decade but nonsupervisory employees have seen their wages growing even faster.</p><p>LONSKI: And it's just common sense. If you have a very low unemployment rate, in some areas you're running out of workers so you have no choice but to give these very low income people that maybe haven't had a job in a while this opportunity to go ahead and get to work, to become employed</p><p>This is a fantastic thing. And I can almost guarantee you that if the unemployment rate declines further, lower income Americans are going to benefit more.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And to your point, Jack, where people are still struggling is in urban areas that are governed locally by Democrats. But you don't hear that. People hear it from you, but not from people running for the White House.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: That is sad. Because as you said, when you have a consumer that at the bottom is starting to rise up a little bit and to feed their families and a lot of these people don't have the educational wherewithal as a lot of other folks do. And that's good for America.</p><p>But Dagen -- to your point about the Democrats running these cities and towns and villages, I'm doing a study right now of the top 10 cities who are going through violence, going through prostitution, drug use, and locking up men left and right. And I can tell you that every single one of them is ran by a Democrat. And so we've got to really start looking deeper at these policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed.</p><p>We're going to talk more about that as the show moves on.</p><p>But to our top story this hour, Made in America.</p><p>President Trump hosting his annual Made in America showcase at the White House yesterday. The President touting the American workforce and announcing a new executive order to boost American manufacturing. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You make your product in America, you have a much better chance of getting the deal. Today I'm pleased to announce that we will begin our buy American requirements but even stronger.</p><p>Currently a product can be 50 percent foreign and it still counts as American made -- figure that one out. In just a few moments I will sign an executive order, that will eventually raise these standards up to 75 percent and above so that domestic goods have to have 75 percent American. And 95 percent for things such as iron and steel.</p><p>The philosophy of my administration is simple. If we can build it, grow it, or make it in the United States, we will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The executive order coming amid the ongoing trade battle with China.</p><p>Joining me now, New York Congressman Ways and Means Committee Member, Tom Reed. Congressman, good to see you.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY), NEW YORK: OK (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your reaction to President Trump's order on making more products in the United States?</p><p>REED: I think President Trump is setting the right policy and the right tone and there's a huge opportunity before us. As you see the contraction in China, and you see the movement of manufacturing operations out of China, we need to make sure America is competitive. So, the choice for U.S. manufacturers is to build in America. That's the opportunity before us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And in terms of building in America, and that would be North America, let's talk about the USMCA, that trade deal that was negotiated by the Trump Administration between Canada and Mexico. What's the state of that in terms of approval in the House of Representatives, when and if will that happen?</p><p>REED: Yes. Well, if it was on the floor, I am very confident in telling you, we have the votes to pass it. We have the votes in the Senate to pass it. It's up to one person and that is Speaker Pelosi. She has the on or off switch in her hand, and she's the barrier. So, you're going to have to speak with her. We're going to have to put pressure on her office to say, get this done, it's the right thing for the American worker.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, does the war of words that we've witnessed in the last few days get in the way of that? So, President Trump going head to head with progressive Democrats, both sides speaking out yesterday following the president's controversial tweet storm over the weekend. Listen to this and then I'll get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you're not happy here, then you can leave. As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country -- if you're not happy here you can leave and that's what I say all the time, that's what I said in tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way.</p><p>REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): I will always refer to him as the occupant, as he is only occupying space.</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): This is a president who has openly violated the very value our country aspires to uphold.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): This president operates in complete bad faith. Weak minds and leaders challenge loyalty to our country in order to avoid challenging and debating the policy.</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I urge House leadership, many of my colleagues to take action to impeach this lawless president today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Democrats now introducing a resolution to condemn the president's comments. Congressman, your reaction.</p><p>REED: Well, you know, obviously the rhetoric is not good on both sides and the problem that I see is extremism, this extremist movement on the left that is taking over the Democratic Party is blocking - they're engaging in more rhetoric and engaging in this escalation of words.</p><p>Where at the end of the day who loses in that battle is the American people for things like the Mexico Canada deal, things like continuing reduce in regulations, reduce in taxes across the country so we're competitive on the world stage.</p><p>That should be where we join together, but the fight on the extreme left is going to continue, it's going to get worse, but we got to send the message we're not here to listen to a bunch of extremists, we're here to listen to the American people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But were you bothered by the president's rhetoric?</p><p>REED: You know, obviously any time you escalate the rhetoric higher on both sides, you should try to avoid that. But what the president is saying is it's a fundamental position, if you don't like America, if you don't want to be part of America's future, then you can leave.</p><p>And that's a clear statement that so many people across the country have expressed to me as well as individuals in a day to day conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but it's also a nativist trope as the Wall Street Journal points out and others and even friends of mine that Catholics have heard, go back to where you came from. Irish, Germans, Italians, Chinese, Japanese and more recently Mexican Americans, go back to where you came from.</p><p>People find it offensive.</p><p>REED: And I would agree with that, that rhetoric I disagree with vehemently. That was not something I would say and it's something that I don't agree with. But having the choice to stand by America and be proud of America and say that, you know, we are the greatest country that's ever existed on the face of the earth as opposed to challenging America, saying that we're the cause of all the problems around the world.</p><p>I've heard this rhetoric, it's dangerous and it's dangerous for generations in the future if that's how they believe America is the bad guy, not the good guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will add this for Democrats and people on the left who are upset by what the president said, they should call out some of the rhetoric from the far left equally loudly, like the anti-Semitism, congress -</p><p>REED: That's the point, the extremism is taking over the conversation in D.C. and you should condemn it on both sides. I condemn that statement by the president in regards to return to that country you came from.</p><p>But at the end of the day I agree with the president in regards to stand by America, be proud of America. America has done so much for people around the world, we should be proud of her each and every day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you know the irony is that the president ran on make America great again and people who speak out in improving America, maybe they might be on the left, many of them are - certainly they - they want to - they're pinpointing things they want to improve.</p><p>So there's actually unity in that, but we just can't seem to get our arms around it. Thank you, Congressman, good to see you.</p><p>REED: Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman Tom Reed.</p><p>Coming up, Prime strategy, Amazon's new revenue stream, while Walmart and Target are struggling to keep up. So it's not about discounts, it's about getting you to sign up for Prime.</p><p>Plus earnings recap, JPMorgan just reporting, Goldman and Wells Fargo are out within the next hour. JPMorgan, stock down about 1 and-a-half percent. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: JPMorgan Chase reporting better than expected quarterly results.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more details on this. Hey Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Taking a look at the numbers -- Dagen. They posted a profit, $282 a share -- that beat the estimate for $250. Revenue $29.6 billion -- that also topped expectations. The bank says its net interest income jumped 7 percent but equity markets revenue fell by 12 percent.</p><p>The stock is actually down in the premarket a little more than 1.25 percent. There's JPMorgan.</p><p>Wells Fargo set to report their second quarter results before the bell as well. The bank expected to post a profit of $1.15, that's up about 7 percent from a year ago. We're waiting. There's Wells Fargo in the premarket, slightly lower. We're waiting on Wells Fargo.</p><p>Another headline we're watching this morning for you. Hispanics buying more homes than any ethnic group in the United States. Census bureau reports that home ownership rate for Hispanics has jumped 3.3 percentage points since the year 2015.</p><p>And 50 years ago today millions of people around the world watched as America launched Apollo 11. The Saturn 5 rocket blasted off carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. Four days later, Armstrong and Aldrin will become the first people to set foot on the moon. After more than eight days in space, of course, the crew safely returned to earth and History was made. We celebrate that today, 50 years -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And a little shout-out to Buzz Aldrin because he's the only person that we've ever let walk off the set with a MORNINGS WITH MARIA mug.</p><p>CASONE: That's right. I forgot about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He had it and he walked out of the studio and we just said -- it's Buzz Aldrin. Buzz Aldrin can have them.</p><p>CASONE: I'd say of all the people that came on the show, boy, he really got a lot of attention. People just worshiped him. It's cool to be him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Superstar.</p><p>Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>Coming up Facebook under pressure, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin laying out cryptocurrency concerns. What he said, next.</p><p>Plus, Mickey's ears are ringing. Disney may be keeping tabs on is visitors. Details ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Facebook on Capitol Hill, the social media giant facing lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee today over the company's proposed digital currency, Libra, and issues related to data privacy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighing in on the cryptocurrency yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY: The Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking.</p><p>Many players have attempted to use cryptocurrencies to fund their maligned behavior. This is indeed a national security issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tech executives also set to go before a House panel today for an anti-trust hearing.</p><p>Joining us now, Metaforce co-founder, Allen Adamson. It's as if these lawmakers just woke up to the fact that oh, these companies have a lot of power and we might want to do something about it.</p><p>ALLEN ADAMSON, CO-FOUNDER, METAFORCE: Well, they have a lot of power now with cryptocurrency. You know, if your computer system gets hacked, they don't say well, just give me your American Express number and we'll let you back in.</p><p>You know, so clearly, there's an issue with cryptocurrency and we need guardrails before we get too far down that road.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How do they put up these guardrails, and what are you expecting to see? What is going to come out of Washington and how much would Libra be delayed do you think?</p><p>ADAMSON: Well, it's a balancing act because we want -- somebody is going to do a cryptocurrency. It is going to become big. The trick is to do it with some guardrails, some control, without letting it be where it is today which is the choice of currency for people who want to do less than terrific things sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think though the way that Facebook has gone about this and the way that they tried to construct it should alleviate concerns?</p><p>ADAMSON: Well, I'm sure they're trying to and I'm sure that's the goal. They've got the scale to do it. But their past with their growth in their social media and some of the short cuts they may or may not have taken make them, you know, a potential risk that you want them to be a little more controlled than when they launched social media in this country.</p><p>BREWER: Allen, I've been personally extorted through bitcoin, you know, had my identity stolen. So I looked into some of these issues. But, you know, block chain technology can be applied to so many different things, not just bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>But my question is, how can you regulate something that's so global, right? I mean because there's just -- it's not like we're dealing with something in American currency. So how in the world are they going to be able to do that?</p><p>ADAMSON: Well, they have to because currencies are global. When you charge into your visa card in a country, you have to have confidence that that transaction is secure, your identity is secure. So it's a cost of entry for the category (ph).</p><p>BREWER: But how do you identify the people to make sure that the bad guys aren't the ones who are doing these transactions?</p><p>ADAMSON: Well, I think it's a chicken and mouse game. For every safeguard we put in I'm sure they'll figure out how to hack it. But we've got to start off with a pretty tight safe, with a more than a simple your birthday combination.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I want to move on to Amazon Prime Day, part deux. Other retailers cutting deals, hold their own sales to try to compete. But for Amazon it's about more than sales.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal -- this is one of the top stories on the paper's Web site. The piece is the one day Amazon Prime Day deal that Walmart and Target can't match. And it's Amazon customers signing up for prime.</p><p>And that is an incredible recurring revenue stream that they're growing because of this two-day sale.</p><p>ADAMSON: And it's about building the brand. You know, anyone can offer a great deal on any day but the more people you get signed up for Prime, you do what we call in marketing create a frictionless situation. You can buy things easily. But more importantly for shoppers, you can return things quickly.</p><p>And once you've got that frictionless option, you look at most households today, there's as many boxes going back as there are coming in. And once you create that, oh that sort of looks interesting, let me try that out. You open up a phenomenal powerful brand.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is Lee's wheelhouse -- marketing. I was making a joke yesterday but the Prime Day is like old school call to action marketing, get it while supplies last, buy now, now, now, like Crazy Eddie.</p><p>CARTER: It's totally that. And it's been fascinating to watch and see how the competitors are trying to match up. So you see Target went out there and they said we don't require membership. Anybody can get it, right. So they're trying to respond to them.</p><p>And the question is, who is winning here because a lot of people are saying Target deals are good but Amazon is getting that recurring customer, they're getting people in. And Amazon owns the day. It's now Amazon Prime Day.</p><p>So I think it's a really fascinating thing to watch and how we're seeing such a different model.</p><p>ADAMSON: Yes. Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla. There's some other big players. But the notion that you can take a customer and say here's a great deal and it's called the loss leader, now buy something else. But with Amazon they're not trying to get you to buy something else. They're trying to get you locked into their system.</p><p>CORKE: And yet they are. I would love to know what the average Amazon Prime member has spent just in the last 24 hours. Because I'm seeing on social media all of these folks are posting, did you get this deal, did you get this deal and people are buying air fryers. Or they're buying all kinds of things that they don't need.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would like to return the entire bag of groceries I bought at Whole Foods on Sunday because a lot of it was molded.</p><p>So on that note, Ashley Webster has Goldman Sachs earnings. I'm looking at earnings per share and the revenue -- it looks like a beat -- Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It does. But we'll dick in a little bit more. But let's start with the headline numbers -- Dagen. Earnings per share coming in on a diluted basis at $5.81, $5.81 -- easily beating the $4.89 estimates. On the revenue side, coming in at almost $9.5 billion, $9.46 billion; better than the estimate of $8.83 billion. That is the good news. The headline numbers beating Wall Street.</p><p>But when you dig down a little bit, you see that on a year to year basis, comparison, the numbers are down. Fixed income, currency and commodities generating $1.47 billion in this second quarter for Goldman Sachs. That is down a whopping 13 percent from the same quarter last year.</p><p>Also looking at investment banking, coming in at $1.86 billion, that is down 9 percent year over year. So these comps compared to the second quarter of last year, not looking good even though the headline numbers are.</p><p>What else do we have here? Net revenues and equities, 6 percent higher than the same period last year. Operating expenses, flat year over year. So it'll be interesting to see how all of this is digested in the premarket. It's essentially flat, up 42-cents.</p><p>We do have a quote from the CEO, Mr. Solomon, saying we are encouraged by the results for the first half of the year as we continue to invest in new businesses and growth. Given the strength of our client franchise, he says, we are well positioned to benefit from a growing global economy.</p><p>But again, headline numbers great but those comps year over year not so good. Goldman Sachs as you can see in premarket just ticking slightly higher -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ashley Webster -- thank you so much for that.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I want to thank Allen Adamson for joining us.</p><p>ADAMSON: Pleasure -- thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's somethings we didn't get to but we covered a lot of ground. Thank you so much.</p><p>ADAMSON: Take care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up -- the border crisis, the Trump administration taking new action to help address the flow of migrants from Central America. The details --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 16th. Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings in focus, Dow component Goldman Sachs just out with a double beat and Goldman has raised its dividend. You heard that right. Goldman Sachs raising its quarterly dividend to $1.25 a share. It's probably giving the stock a little bit of a lift. Johnson &amp; Johnson and J.P. Morgan also out last hour, both of those companies beating expectations. J.P. Morgan's stock is about 1-1/2 percent lower. But Johnson &amp; Johnson gaining in premarket trading. Wells Fargo earnings out shortly. In the next hour, we will have the numbers.</p><p>Checking on markets, Futures are looking for a positive open after another day of record all time high closes. The Dow Futures up 19 points at the moment.</p><p>Again, yesterday, another round of records for all three major market gauges here in the U.S.</p><p>In Europe, you have some buying to report. Gains across the board. The biggest winner at the moment, the FTSE 100, up almost half of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed markets. The NIKKEI and Shanghai lower, the reverse in Hong Kong and South Korea.</p><p>A new privacy concern, Disneyland reportedly keeping tabs on its visitors and profiting from the data. The details on that.</p><p>Plus, the growing business of marijuana, the CEO of the company that has signed Jay-Z as its chief brand strategist.</p><p>We have some tweets from President Trump to get to right now. The president tweeting about the Democratic Congresswomen that he's been feuding with, writing this. The Democrat Congresswomen who have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, and yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party. Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro terrorist and public shouting of the F word, among many other terrible things and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate lace things that they have said? Because they are the radical left and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad, exclamation point.</p><p>Lee, he's not giving this up. He's going to keep hammering and hammering and hammering this. He's not going to stop.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLASNKY PARTNERS AND POLLSTER: Oh, no, he's not. And you know, he can't stop himself, and this is a moment where he needs to. This is like going to take over our conversations, this is all we're going to be talking about. We're not going to be talking about anything positive. We're going to be talking about this. He needs to stop it. He needs to say that what he said was wrong and we need to move forward because this is a mess. He's digging a deeper hole. He's just -- and that's the first rule, (INAUDIBLE) like you have to stop digging the hole.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll talk about policy but not personality. But again, is next year going to be a referendum on the president's character and behavior? He's giving the Democrats ammunition.</p><p>CARTER: He's giving them complete ammunition and he needs to stop, because we should be talking about things like the economy, consumer confidence, let's talk about a million other things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or the border crisis. Let's talk about that and policy. The Trump administration issuing a new asylum rule going to effect today, it requires migrants trying to enter the U.S. through the southern border to seek asylum in the first country they cross through. Migrants will no longer be allowed to apply for protections in the U.S. if they fail to do so in another country. President Trump weighing in on this yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We protect other people's borders but we don't want to protect our own border. We'd fight for the right of other countries to have a strong, powerful border so nobody can come in. But our border was like a leaking sieve.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The ACLU threatening lawsuits over the changes. Joining me now is the former acting ICE Director, John Sandweg. Good to see you, John. The president is having to act in this way because Congress will not close some of these loopholes, but will it stand a test in court?</p><p>JOHN SANDWEG, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Well, I think we'll find out pretty quickly. I suspect there's an ACLU lawyers working pretty hard last night on a -- on a complaint. The rule will go into effect today. It will be interesting to see what impact that has at the border. I would anticipate there will be some litigation very quickly, and we'll see if a court issues an injunction or not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Would this -- would this move, though, John, will it help alleviate the illegal immigration problem, the overwhelming problem that we're experiencing right now at the border?</p><p>SANDWEG: I mean, in terms of what's going to happen at the border, I think it would probably lighten some of the pressure. The issue right now really isn't the number of people. Believe it or not, the Border Patrol has handled more people frankly with far fewer resources.</p><p>The issue is the time it takes to process these individuals and send them back to their home country. Because they're making these asylum claims, that triggers a whole bunch of legal reviews that ultimately ends up in a hearing before an immigration judge.</p><p>So what the administration is trying to do is shorten that length of time, that will allow the Border Patrol to process people more quickly and it will -- and avoid the backlogs that result in the overcrowded detention facilities that we're on the -- on the screen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you expect anything to happen coming out of Congress, John, in terms of -- I've got a long list that I keep of things that need to be done, in terms of making it easier to deport unaccompanied minors back to non-contiguous countries. Again, that was a law that was passed that made it more difficult to send those young people, those minors back. That was a law that was passed at the end of 2008 before President Obama was inaugurated. That's just one of the things. But then, again, tighten the standards for asylum claims, again, the credible fear of persecution is the current standard and it's a low bar.</p><p>SANDWEG: It is. And that's what triggers those legal reviews that trigger the delays. But look, if anyone is banking on Congress to do anything, they really ought to look somewhere else for a solution to this. There's not going to be a Congressional solution. We've been trying to get immigration legislation passed for, you know, 15, 20 years now. Congress just isn't capable of passing immigration legislation.</p><p>Personally, I think what we ought to do is look at the surging resources in to get these claims processed quickly so we can apply the rule of law at the border. I think we can do that through resources, by especially with the immigration courts, USCIS officers. It will be interesting to see the impact of this rule, it will be interesting to see if it goes into effect. But I would -- I have no hope that Congress is going to do anything anytime soon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do -- what about, do we need more of the immigration law judges as well?</p><p>SANDWEG: We do. I mean, listen, I know that -- I think it rankles the president a little bit. But look, the biggest impediments everything the president wants to achieve on immigration, frankly is the under staff immigration courts.</p><p>Collectively, we as a country just have kind of neglected them. They are essential not just for what's going on at the border, but also in terms of enforcing the laws in the interior of the United States. We have 11.5 million undocumented immigrants. That by the -- that is the single biggest impediment to ICE. It was the biggest impediment. When I was there, it remains the biggest impediment.</p><p>We have over a million cases with only 350 judges. An investment there makes a tremendous amount of sense. This administration has increased the number of beds, Obama increased the number of bed, but nowhere near enough to keep up with the overall numbers of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You said 350 judges handling one million cases?</p><p>SANDWEG: Ballpark, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's astonishing.</p><p>SANDWEG: It is and that's why you have these backlogs. So that's why -- look, I get where people are frustrated by the asylum seekers. A part of - - I look at it a little more pragmatically. I recognize that as long as the United States is the United States, we're going to be a magnet drawing people into this country because of -- you know, we have -- we can guarantee safety and econo -- and economic opportunity.</p><p>But we have a process in place that actually works. I know that there's a lot of frustration, Congress won't change the laws but we can -- we're not implementing the current process simply because that we are overwhelmed and having roughly a million cases backlogged with 350 judges, it's not a surprise that if you come up to this country and make an asylum claim, it would be three to four years potentially before your asylum claim is heard because the judges just cannot keep up with the flow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow, John, thank you so much. John Sandweg, please come back. Terrific discussion. Thank you again.</p><p>SANDWEG: My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, weighing in on 2020, Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel talking about the candidates, who he finds inspiring and a little scary.</p><p>Plus, Mickey's listening. Disney keeping tabs on the visitors, sounds like what the casinos started doing years ago. Why your data is so important, later this hour.</p><p>CASONE: Welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone with some headlines we're watching for you this morning. Billionaire investor and Trump supporter Peter Thiel weighed in on which Democratic presidential candidate poses the biggest threat in 2020. He of course is a President Trump supporter, he made his comments on \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\", watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER THIEL, CO-FOUNDER, PAYPAL, PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES AND FOUNDERS FUND: I'm most scared by Elizabeth Warren. I think -- I think she's the one who's actually talking about the economy, which is the only thing that I think -- the thing that I think matters by far the most.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Thiel said almost all of the other Democrats running for president are more preoccupied with identity politics calling them, quote, uninspiring.</p><p>Well, IKEA is closing its only factory in the United States. The Swedish furniture giant going to move those operations from Virginia to Europe where it says production costs are lower. IKEA said the price of raw materials in the United States, key factor in making this decision. The closure going to cost Virginia 300 jobs.</p><p>All right. Hi, Mickey. Disney, they are tracking the moves of visitors at their theme parks and they're making big money off of it. Bloomberg's reporting that the Magic Kingdom monitors smartphone apps and electronic wristbands to increase park capacity and reduce wait times. While data mining has gotten other companies said the troubled Disney's park division is booming with operating profit up 18 percent last year to $4.5 billion. And those are your headlines. Dagen, back over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Lee, I want to get your reaction to what Peter Thiel said about Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CARTER: I don't think she's the only threat but I certainly think she has come out swinging. And her -- she's the one really refrain the economic issues now about saying the economy's not working for every man, it's working for the -- you know, for big companies. And I think that's a very dangerous narrative and she's picking up momentum.</p><p>I also think Kamala Harris is one to watch there too because she is absolutely gaining momentum and has a great message and is really resonating with her base. So, I'd watch out for those two women if I were -- if I were Donald Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two things that someone who's conservative would certainly or a libertarian with (INAUDIBLE) about Elizabeth Warren's idea, is one, raising her hand at the first debate in favor of taking away private insurance from 180 million Americans. She believe --</p><p>CARTER: Absolutely. Apparently, single payer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She believes that the government and bureaucrats and politicians make better decisions about your own health insurance than people in private industry, than the company that you work for, or you.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because it's going to be price controls and rationing and they will tell you which doctor you can go to essentially.</p><p>CARTER: Well, what's worst to me about that is that she doesn't even believe that you should have a private option. That's to me like, OK, if you want to have every healthcare for everybody, but allow people to still buy on the free market. She's saying no, all government.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's full government health insurance.</p><p>CARTER: Full government healthcare.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Number one. And number two, she has a wealth tax that she's laid out in great detail. That is wealth confiscation. That is -- that harkens back to something the Soviet Union would have done. It's not socialist, it's actually communist, to put confiscating someone's wealth. And it's unconstitutional, quite frankly. So, good luck with that, but she's running on it. That's one of her -- you know, I've got a plan for that.</p><p>CARTER: She is -- I've got to say though, she is doing a very good job of packaging up her ideologies, her policies and she is gaining momentum in a way that she didn't four years ago. She's more likable. She's more relatable and I think it's been fascinating to watch from a pure messaging perspective. From a policy perspective, buyer beware.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And but the native American reveal was a disaster. And coming from the party of identity politics, again, how she doesn't get called out on that at some point in one of these debates is beyond me, that they don't call her out for that embarrassing display of trying to claim -- again, she listed herself as a native American. Actually, she -- it was American Indian is the way it read on her Bar application in Texas.</p><p>CARTER: Well, I don't think the target is on her yet. I think that people are really -- they've been looking at Biden. And so that's why if you look him up, they came out swinging at him. And people are looking at Bernie Sanders right now, and now they're looking at Kamala Harris. But I think that people should start looking at her pretty carefully too. And when you start seeing attacks coming her way, you'll know that she's starting to win.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know who raised the most money in the quarter, Pete Buttigieg in the most recent quarter.</p><p>CARTER: Well, he, we could do a whole segment on his messaging because he is the messaging master.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Democratic fund raising, he raised almost $25 million in the most recent quarter. That was about $3 million more than Joe Biden. So there you go.</p><p>Coming up, bank earnings in focus, Wells Fargo out with second quarter numbers in about 10 minutes and that follows strong results from Goldman Sachs. The stock jumping on the news. Again, it raises dividend, more when we return.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The big business of marijuana, Caliva, now California's largest vertically integrated cannabis company with revenues growing 350 percent in the last year. Caliva announcing a multiyear partnership with -- you were hearing him, Jay-Z. Who will become the company's chief brand strategist. Joining me now the CEO and president of Caliva, Dennis O'Malley. Dennis, good to see you. How did you hook up with Jay-Z?</p><p>DENNIS O'MALLEY, CEO AND PRESIDENT, CALIVA: Yes, thanks so much for having us. We are -- we are absolutely thrilled to be able to announce the multiyear partnership with Mr. Shawn Carter. Again, Mr. Carter could have worked with any cannabis, you know, company in the world and he chose Caliva. And as a creative genius and a cultural icon, you know, we really look to work with Mr. Carter as Caliva seeks to really create the next great American consumer brand and we really believe this partnership will give us the ability to do so.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: How you doing? This is Jack Brewer. I know Jay-Z.</p><p>O'MALLEY: Hi, Jack.</p><p>BREWER: How's it going? I know Jay-Z --</p><p>O'MALLEY: Good.</p><p>BREWER: -- he has a huge focus on criminal justice. And I know that was a big part of what his movement is all about. You know, we're in a -- we're in a country that, you know, places like California and others are profiting billions of dollars from marijuana but yet, you know, in our inner cities, we're getting, you know, black and brown men are locked up every day and the normal Americans getting thrown in jail for it.</p><p>And so, how big is that for your company? And are you trying to really set the standard and really raise the bar for other cannabis companies?</p><p>O'MALLEY: Yes, Jack, it's a very important point. We absolutely are. I think you've seen that Caliva has a real track record of putting social justice as a priority. We certainly were in the news when we did a partnership with Ben &amp; Jerry's during 420 where we brought attention to a program called Clear My Record, which is part of code of -- code for America, which is helping those with nonviolent cannabis convictions actually be able to expunge that off their record.</p><p>You can see on Caliva's career pages today that if somebody's worried about what their cannabis criminal record is in terms of preventing them from potentially getting into Caliva or from a job force that we're providing them some guidance and resources. But we certainly take it very seriously.</p><p>If you go to Caliva.com and see Mr. Carter's statement around what he seeks to do within this partnership, it's a major priority for us within this partnership and it's a very important point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dennis, I want to talk more about this business. Please come back. And I apologize that we had so little time. But thank you for coming on and announcing your work with Jay-Z or Mr. Carter.</p><p>O'MALLEY: Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Mr. Carter. Thank you, Dennis. Take care.</p><p>O'MALLEY: Yes, Take care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dennis O'Malley of Caliva. Bank earnings when we come back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 16th. Your top stories at 08:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings in focus, Wells Fargo's numbers coming up in moments, we have the numbers full analysis. Dow component Goldman Sachs out in the last hour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019071602cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKC-YDD1-DXH2-63PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Lyman ROME</location> Nov. 28</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Italy will become the first European  Union member state to start taxing online sales, with plans to  start collecting a 6-percent levy on such transactions beginning  in January 2019. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    A budget committee of the Italian senate has passed the  provision aimed at introducing a tax on digital sales. The  proposal was approved on Monday in the form of an amendment to the  2018 budget. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    According to the provision, a 6 percent levy would be applied  on all digital sales (business-to-business and  business-to-consumer). </p><p>    The new tax was estimated to produce an extra income of about  114 million euros (135.9 million U.S. dollars) per year for the  Italian state. A major goal of the new legislation would be to  tackle big multinational digital companies -- such as Google and  Facebook, for example -- whose revenues are partly generated by  online sales in Italy. The need of such a levy was being discussed  at European Union (EU) level as well. </p><p>    The start date is more than a year away, but it will still make  Italy the first European country to formalize plans for such a  tax, which has drawn strong criticism from online giants like  Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google where it has been proposed. </p><p>    The new regulation would be a change from current tax schemes,  which tax profits and allow companies to log those profits in  countries with low corporate tax rates. </p><p>    Though the measure will add income to Italian government  coffers, Paolo Cellini, a professor of Internet economics at  Rome's LUISS University, believes the main reasons behind the tax  may be political. \"You have these giant web companies making  millions in profits,\" Cellini told Xinhua. \"It is easy to see some  political motives behind the decision to tax them.\" </p><p>    Tommaso di Tanno, a tax expert and founder of the Di Tanno and  Associates Studio, would be applied to \"all digital services  provided in Italy,\" though it is not yet clear how and if  intangible products -- such as advertisement or intellectual  property -- will be taxed. </p><p>    The Italian Ministry of Finance has said it will detail how the  tax will work no later than April 2018, though it has said the  levy will target large multinationals and not smaller Italy-based  companies, which will receive an exemption from the tax. </p><p>    The estimate of the value of the tax that appeared in the  Italian press is based on an estimate that taxable services will  be worth around 2 billion euros (2.4 billion U.S. dollars), taxed  at 6 percent. </p><p>    But di Tanno told Xinhua the size of the market could prove to  be much larger over time. \"There are no exact figures, but the  estimates are that the European digital economy produces 400  billion euros (480 billion U.S. dollars) a year in revenue,\" he  said. \"If 10 ercent of that is Italian that works out to 40  billion euros (48 billion U.S. dollars). Now that may be high. But  even if it's half that, it is not an insignificant amount of  money.\" </p><p>    Regardless, the tax is unlikely to have a major impact on the  digital sector -- in part because other European countries are  expected to follow Italy's leads, and in part because the physical  presence of these multinationals in Italy is relatively small. </p><p>    \"Facebook has around 20 employees based in Italy; Google may  have 100,\" Cellini said. \"One of the reasons Italy can be first on  this is because Italy gets less from these big tech companies than  other countries do.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINHUA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINHUA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2J-44F1-DY91-H357-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8078</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>7:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Xinhua News Agency</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua General News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 28, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But these are hardly struggling non-profit firms, with members including MasterCard, PayPal, Uber, and Lyft.</p><p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Libra is in reality \"a currency controlled by an undemocratically selected coalition of large, massive corporations.\"</p><p>Representative Ann Wagner, a former member of the Republican National Committee, pointed out a huge downside risk, suggesting that Facebook would undermine the power of the U.S. dollar, and even destabilize the global economy.</p><p>\"I'm concerned that a 2020 launch date demonstrates deep insensitivities around how Libra could impact our national security, the global financial system, the privacy of people across the globe, criminal activity, and international human rights,\" said Wagner.</p><p>DOLLAR THREAT?</p><p>Analysts reckon the moves by Facebook could potentially revolutionize the financial industry, and that has deeply concerned the Congress.</p><p>\"Libra is no small endeavor,\" Marwan Forzley, CEO of e-commerce financial firm, Veem, based in San Francisco, told Xinhua. \"With the launch of a cryptocurrency-based payments system on the back of its social network, Facebook could revolutionize the banking and payments ecosystem completely.\"</p><p>Forzley explained that, by building an infrastructure around Libra, Facebook would create a \"currency\" that can in fact compete with the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\"Facebook will give users more options when it comes to transferring funds, leading the way to mainstreaming multi-rail payments methods. Libra will need to consider regulatory and government responses to address issues of money laundering,\" said Forzley.</p><p>Christopher Robling, an international business consultant and founder of Clearspan Strategic, LLC, based in Chicago, told Xinhua that Facebook wants to coin its own money. \"Congress is barely catching up, and probably has no clear idea of what to do, and won't after the hearings, because it is paralyzed. But, the pressures of digital communications on traditional regulatory schemes could not be more apparent.\"</p><p>According to media reports, the House Financial Services Committee is considering legislation called \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance,\" which prohibits tech companies with at least 25 billion dollars in revenue -- like Facebook -- from issuing private digital currencies that compete with the greenback.</p><p>In fact, the hearings at the House and the Senate followed the news that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government anti-corporate fraud watchdog, lambasted Facebook with the largest penalty ever against Silicon Valley, commanding the company to pay 5 billion dollars for consumer privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>FTC initiated the investigation after a scandal involving former British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of illegally accessing data of more than 87 million Facebook users without their prior knowledge. FTC investigated whether Facebook's data sharing with the British firm violated a 2011 consent agreement signed between Facebook and the regulator.</p><p>The matter has been moved to the U.S. Justice Department for a review. The fine, if finalized, might be the largest one the FTC has ever levied on a tech company. Facebook, however, can afford it: the company brought in almost 56 billion dollars in revenue last year. Facebook said in April that it expected to pay up to 5 billion dollars to settle the probe.

The platform must make any such record available for online public inspection in a machine-readable format. Any person submitting a purchase request for a qualified political advertisement must provide the online platform with all the information it needs to comply with these requirements, according to the bill analysis.</p><p> The news associations also pointed out that \"public disclosure of advertising rates could create a competitive disadvantage to any media companies that are soliciting sales of political advertising. The digital advertising marketplace is complex and published rates could be misleading, particularly if packaged with traditional time or space.\"</p><p> The bill also includes a wide range of potential penalties for failure to comply, depending on the severity of noncompliance, starting with fines of up to $10,000 outside of 90 days before an election. However, within 90 days of an election, noncompliance can lead to a fine of up to $20,000 or twice the value of the ads related to the noncompliance, whichever is greater.</p><p> Further, the bill says that if the SEEC finds that any such failure is \"knowing and willful,\" then the penalty can be up to $50,000 or 10 times the amount of the total of all ads for which the \"online platform\" was noncompliant, whichever is greater. And the SEEC may then refer the matter to the office of the Chief State's Attorney.</p><p> SEEC Executive Director Michael Brandi did not respond to requests for comment on the legislation Thursday, but testified that the requirement to maintain a separate website would help his agency better audit campaigns.</p><p> \"Online ads are increasingly common and the disclosure laws are inadequate to allow for the post-election review and inspection of those ads, which is necessary when (public) campaign funds are spent to purchase these ads and especially when inadequate documentation is provided by vendors to substantiate the purchases, or dark money is used to purchase the ads,\" Brandi told the General Administration and Elections Committee. \"Changing technology and social [media] platforms, and other advertising networks can now target electronic ads at groups and individuals, they can be displayed for a moment, and then disappear without a trace or any easily available record. Our agency is tasked with investigating and enforcing violations surrounding these ads \u2014 we need the tools to do it.\"</p><p> The news associations believe that all reporting responsibilities should fall on the person making the expenditure for the advertisement.</p><p> \"Instead, the reporting requirements should apply only to those requesting or purchasing advertising (e.g., candidates and independent expenditure political committees), who are already in possession of the information the bill is seeking,\" the associations wrote.</p><p> Sen. Matt Lesser, who introduced similar legislation in SB 642, regarding reporting by \"online platforms,\" said his intention was to target large tech companies like Facebook and Google, but the news associations are wary about what they see as an overly broad definition of \"online platforms\" in the bill.</p><p> Lesser said that in the last few weeks of his 2018 election campaign he was unable to get Facebook to adequately display his advertising even though the company said it was going to do it for free for all candidates in the days leading up to the election.</p><p> It's unclear how Facebook changes its algorithm in these situations and that was frustrating to Lesser, who was running for state Senate for the first time.</p><p> \"My intention was to make sure it targets big tech companies,\" Lesser said Thursday of his legislation. \"If we have to amend, then we'll amend it.\"</p><p> He said he had no intention of targeting news organizations.</p><p> Political advertising sales on television are already being regulated by the FCC and online ads currently require specific disclosures regarding the top five donors or links to more information about the group with the financial information.</p><p> David McGuire, Executive Director of the ACLU of Connecticut, also submitted testimony in opposition to SB 642, suggesting that its restrictions run counter to constitutional free speech protections.</p><p> \"Senate Bill 642 would inappropriately include in the above mentioned categories an expenditure that displays the name, face, or voice of a candidate 90 days or less before an election if the expenditure was 'not made neutrally or evenly as to' the candidate and their opponents,\" McGuire wrote. \"The expenditures this bill seeks to include are not limited to where there is a connection to a candidate or campaign, nor does the bill focus on whether the expenditure is actually independent. Rather, it focuses on what is being advertised, the speech itself.\"</p><p> Further, McGuire wrote that the \"additional provision appears to encompass all political campaign ads run by independent organizations on major social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google. Although we are sympathetic to the intended purpose of the legislation, the language proposed does not relate to the issue of 'independence' covered in this statute. It applies to independent expenditures that cannot be constitutionally restricted. The language focuses on expenditures 'made neutrally or evenly as to [all candidates],' but constitutionally-protected independent expenditures almost always are made in support of only one candidate. In short, as written, the bill asserts that something that might be independent is presumed not independent merely because it uses a new platform.\"</p><p> McGuire also suggested that SB 642 unfairly penalizes digital news and social media companies: \"Including these expenditures would also favor traditional media over digital and social media because the restrictions in the language would apply only to expenditures by or on social media and not to similar expenditures and disseminations of information in newspapers, radio, or television.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Christine Stuart / ctnewsjunkie file photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-468e8d8fe4324275a345fe964c7ab3b2286dc2f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D8863462881A NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W05-TCH1-DXVP-V4HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1185\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dig and Scoop LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

So executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, also Google are going to be facing lawmakers today.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah. The four tech leaders appear before Congress together - OK, not exactly together because they're going to appear remotely because of the pandemic, which just underlines the overwhelming role that the Internet plays in daily life. These firms that dominate their industry face a big question - have they misused their power to hurt competitors and help themselves?             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID GREENE:                 OK. An important full disclosure here - we do want to note that all four companies are among NPR's financial supporters. Now we can turn to NPR's Alina Selyukh, who is covering this hearing. Hi, Alina.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALINA SELYUKH:                 Good morning.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. So these companies have been growing a lot over the last two decades. No one is surprised by it. So why is Congress deciding to hold this hearing now?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Right. Lawmakers are finally considering whether they need to take a more active role in policing these powerful platforms. As you point out, these companies have long been held in high regard as models of American scrappy ingenuity. But they stopped being scrappy startups a long time ago. And put together, they're now worth almost $5 trillion. For their entire existence, they faced very little regulation. But in recent years, critics have piled on accusations of anti-competitive behavior. The Justice Department and state attorneys general started investigations and so has the committee that's holding this hearing today. They've been investigating for over a year, and today is the last stop on that journey.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. Well, if this is the last stop, what are we expecting to hear from lawmakers? What are they going to focus on?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Largely competition is the goal to focus on in this hearing. The four companies are very different, of course, with lots of nuance. But, generally, critics have been saying how competing with at least three of them - Amazon, Apple and Google - is like playing against a team that also owns the stadium, hires the referees and writes the rules of the game.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 They basically do everything. But the companies are different, right? I mean, can you give us a sense of some of the key questions, like, for each of them?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Sure. It's a bit of a dense list, but let me try to hit some of the bigger themes. For Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, this is actually his first appearance before Congress. But if the committee sticks to the topic, I'm expecting lots of questions about whether Amazon exploits data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its own benefit, back to this idea of Amazon both running the marketplace and selling on it. For Apple's Tim Cook, questions are likely to focus on the app store and whether Apple gives itself an unfair advantage in how it charges developers for every transaction there. For Google's Sundar Pichai, the big themes are Google's dominant search and digital advertising where the company controls almost a third of the market. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has been to the Hill a lot lately, so he'll probably get more questions about disinformation and political speech but also how the company buys or copies its competitors. All the companies are expected to push back, that they face a lot of competition and generally represent a big success story of American innovation.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 All right. Well, let's go with your metaphor that this year-long investigation was like a train trip and this was the last stop on the journey. Where does the train go next? What happens now after this?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 The final stop of this train, I suppose, is when the committee finishes and publishes its findings. I spoke with Gene Kimmelman, former Department of Justice antitrust official, now at consumer group Public Knowledge, and he sums up the question at the heart of this like this.             </p><p>GENE KIMMELMAN:                 Beyond a simple antitrust case, what does the law need to look like to ensure that we have open and vibrant competition in a digital marketplace?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 So maybe it's a journey to reconsider existing laws, maybe write new ones. That, of course, the companies would fight tooth and nail.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. NPR's Alina Selyukh, it's been nice being on this journey with you. Thanks, Alina.             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. We have to say, it got pretty tense on Capitol Hill already yesterday.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Attorney General William Barr came to testify. Democrats had questions. Barr defended federal agents' use of force against peaceful protesters in Portland, Ore.</p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>WILLIAM BARR:                 What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called protest. It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Democrats also accused Barr of politicizing the Justice Department to support friends of President Trump.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. We have NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson with us. Hi, Carrie.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Hi, David.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Well, let's start with these protests. What did lawmakers have to say about them to the attorney general?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 David, remember, these protests began after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. Democrats on the committee said the vast majority of these protesters are peaceful, even in Portland. They called it a place where moms and veterans have gathered. But the attorney general focused on attacks on the federal court building in Portland with fireworks and protesters barricading the door and setting fires. He says these aren't protesters; they're attackers. He says deputy U.S. marshals have been injured, they're tired and that he would be happy if state and local officials picked up the slack and did more to protect the courthouse so the feds could do less. Democrats showed the attorney general videos of a Navy veteran who went up to some of the law enforcement on the street and who got beaten and tear gassed. And Bill Barr said most people near the court were violent, and the tear gas might have been in the air already.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. So in addition to questions about those protests, it sounds like Democrats were very blunt and basically saying that the attorney general has been rewarding the president's friends, punishing enemies. This is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JERROLD NADLER:                 In your time at the department, you have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. So how did Barr respond to that?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Well, Barr said the president has never asked him, directed him or pressured him to do anything in a criminal case. The attorney general says he acts independent of the White House and what he calls the mob of public opinion. A couple of lawmakers asked him if he could come up with an example of a time when he weighed in on a punishment for a defendant who was not a friend of the president, referring to the Roger Stone case here, of course. The attorney general responded this way.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>WILLIAM BARR:                 What enemies have I indicted? Who - could you point to one indictment that has been under the department that you feel is unmerited, that you feel violates the rule of law? One indictment.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 So, David, it got really hot in here, to borrow a phrase. The hearing went on that way for hours with the lawmakers interrupting Barr a lot and, by the end, Barr interrupting some of the Democratic members of Congress, too.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Well, I mean, just a lot to talk about, including the presidential election, right, Carrie? I mean, we're about three months away. How did that come up in a hearing, you know, about the Justice Department?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 The election came up in two different ways. One, President Trump and Attorney General Barr have both raised questions about the security of mail-in ballots. Barr did that again. But most voting experts do not think that that will be a widespread problem. Second, Barr has ordered an investigation of the intelligence community and the FBI in 2016. He refused yesterday to say he would not release those findings before the election. So that's still possible out there.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks so much.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 My pleasure.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. As we said, the election is coming under a hundred days from now. And, Steve, you've actually been out doing what matters most in any election - that's listening to voters.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah. I grabbed a bunch of masks, got in the car and drove to a swing state that's closely contested - Ohio. Ashtabula County is in Northeast Ohio. The main city is also called Ashtabula and it's one of those classic Rust Belt industrial towns that you know so well, David, which voted for generations for Democrats, including President Obama. But then the county flipped to President Trump.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Oh, interesting place to go then. So what do you feel like you discovered there?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, on the surface, the kind of polarized political debate we've heard everywhere. Not many people are changing their opinions of the president at this point, but we also found a number of younger people in Ashtabula County who are trying to influence this fall's election.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 So how do they want to do that?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, maybe you can't change voters' minds, but you can add voters, which is what Eli Kalil hopes to do. He is the Democratic county chairman, and he is 23.             </p><p>ELI KALIL:                 I think there's that maybe 1% and probably even smaller than that that voted for Trump who won't vote for him this upcoming election. So, yeah, we need to find another - a different demographic of voters who, you know, maybe they're not always enthused. Maybe they don't get to the polls all the time. You know, we need to figure out how we get them to the polls because we think that's where our base is going to be.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Trying to expand the number of younger, more diverse voters who show up and Kalil is hoping that they will include the likes of Wisdom Davis, his former high school classmate who's also 23 years old. She organized a protest this summer against police violence, and there was a voter registration table there.             </p><p>WISDOM DAVIS:                 Because a lot of people just want change so much, but then they're like they just want it but they don't want to - they don't know how to take the steps.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Wisdom Davis knows that voting is important. She voted last time, but she voted third party then. And I should note she is not committed to the Democrat Joe Biden yet this time.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Well, I mean, that makes me want to ask you about 2016. I mean, you said this is a county that voted for generations for Democrats. How did Democrats feel like they lost the county in 2016?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, they were a big union party, of course, and as unions, industrial unions, declined, the Democrats declined. Some local Democrats think the party got a little lazy, lost touch with voters. Trump captured voters' imagination, worked for voters, showed up in Ashtabula County and did very well in Ohio, which is older and whiter than the electorate as a whole. He seems to have that demographic advantage there, which means Ohio hasn't been talked about as much as other states. But polling shows it's really competitive right now.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Well, and what is the Republican plan? How are they pushing back here?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, it's not just Democrats that are hoping for younger voters to turn out because Republicans have a kind of youth movement going in public offices in the county. David Thomas is one of them. He's the county auditor at the age of 27, and he says he won his election as President Trump did, with an overwhelming vote in the county's rural areas.             </p><p>DAVID THOMAS:                 Prior to 2016, essentially the votes were in the cities where our population centers were. You had to win them in order to win the county. Myself as an example, I lost all three of our cities but won outside of the cities in some of the suburban areas but mainly in some of our rural areas, too, that have grown not only in population but also just in voter participation.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Thomas sees enthusiasm for the president still, although some voters are disappointed and, of course, the president invokes race in a way that's divisive. The bottom line is you got two men in their 70s running for president, and there are people in their 20s who could have something to do with who wins.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Steve, thanks for bringing us these voices.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Glad do it. Glad to talk with you, as always, David.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2020072917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-GGT1-DY2S-N02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Outside the palace, protesters will be raising signs during several anti-Trump rallies happening today. During the state visit, the president has been on Twitter jabbing at Mexico and suggesting that people boycott the company that owns CNN. The president has also weighed in on British politics.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE INSKEEP:                 So much to discuss with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey there, Mara.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARA LIASSON:                 Hi, Steve.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 What's the president saying?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 The president is saying a lot of things that he would be very unhappy if another foreign leader came to the U.S. and did something similar. But he has waded into British politics. This is something he's done before when he's visited England. He has spoke very highly of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Those are two politicians who - at least Boris Johnson wants to succeed Theresa May.             </p><p>                It's possible that he actually has hurt Johnson's chances to be the next prime minister because, as you mentioned, Donald Trump is very unpopular in England. He has a 70% disapproval rating. And there are going to be big protests today, lots of people in the street and a big baby in a diaper balloon flying overhead.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Which has been getting lots of attention on social media.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 The president, of course, has been speaking up on Brexit for a long time, generally favorably; it's a very divisive issue in Britain to say the least. What's he offering, though, in the way of a solution?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 He's not really offering anything in the way of the solution. He has said he is in favor of a no-deal Brexit. He wants England to just pull out or walk away, as he says. He has dangled the idea of a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Britain once they're out of the EU. But that's going to be very hard for him to deliver because he is fighting multiple trade wars against China, Mexico. And his own trade agenda is in turmoil at home because of that.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 So he's able to offer that trade deal at the length of a tweet. But offering the trade deal on the length of an actual trade deal might be a little more complicated.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 So what else is on the president's agenda?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, there are a lot of things on the agenda. Despite all those nice words reaffirming the special relationship, the U.S. and Great Britain are at odds over the Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump has exited. They disagree about using telecom equipment from the Chinese company Huawei. The U.S. is having a very hard time convincing its European allies to boycott that company over national security questions.             </p><p>                Then there is climate change. The U.S. pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. England, like the rest of the United States' allies, has stayed in. And experts say they can't think of a time that there has been so many deep differences and strains between these two countries who are supposed to be the closest of allies.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Supposed to be the closest of allies, but the United States is the larger one and the more powerful one. And that's not something that this president, in his style, is liable to not mention. He expects things to go his way.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 He does, although he can't always get them to go his way, as we see in issue after issue.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Mara, thanks so much.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Thank you.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 That's NPR's Mara Liasson.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK. Billions of people use one of these companies or all of them - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook. And now all face questions from the United States government about their power and reach.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Yeah. House lawmakers are planning to investigate whether big tech companies have gotten too big and too powerful to the point that they're doing a disservice to consumers. And the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are setting their sights on these companies, too, which could mean more oversight.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Washington Post tech policy reporter Tony Romm has covered this extensively. He's in our studios. Good morning. Thanks for coming by.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Hey. Good morning.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK. So what is Congress doing first to investigate these companies?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah. Congress is asking this question - are big tech companies too big? And I think, realistically, for some of these companies, like Facebook and Google and Amazon and Apple, the walls are sort of closing in here in Washington.             </p><p>                We've heard lots of theoretical issues raised by academics and tech company critics that these companies harm competition, that they harm consumers. But now lawmakers are getting into the thick of it. They're asking these questions. They plan to obtain documents from the companies, even by subpoena if necessary. They plan to bring some of these top tech executives to Washington for what could be another round of public testimony.             </p><p>                And at the end of the day, if you talk to lawmakers like David Cicilline, the top Democrat who runs the House Judiciary Committee's competition panel, the goal is to figure out whether the U.S. government's antitrust laws are really up to snuff and to adapt them if necessary.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Of course, it's the Trump administration that is charged with enforcing those antitrust laws. Is the administration looking at these companies?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 They're certainly starting to look at these companies - at least according to some of the reports that we and others have put out in the past few days. There's been this quiet divvying up of sorts that's happened at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. government's two major antitrust enforcement agencies, that would see, you know, Amazon taken on by the Federal Trade Commission, for example, and Google shifted over to the Department of Justice.             </p><p>                Now, these things don't immediately suggest there's going to be some wide-ranging, multi-year investigation opened up and some breakup of these big tech giants in the imminent future. But these sort of steps suggest that the agencies are getting much more serious about antitrust in big tech.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, when we talk about antitrust, of course, we're talking about monopolies or functional monopolies, companies that are just too dominant. Can you help explain what the case would be against these firms? I get that Apple is really big, but I can buy a different phone. I get that Google is really big, but I can use a different search engine. Amazon and Facebook, of course, are huge, but there are other platforms out there. What is the case against them?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah. It all depends on who you ask. Right? These companies say that they're certainly great, you know? They're not causing trouble for competition and consumers. And they point to the fact that consumers love to own and use these devices and services. But then there's this whole crop of critics who point to specific things that these companies have done that they say stifle competition.             </p><p>                So take Google, for example. Yes, it's a very powerful, widely used search engine. But in the eyes of some of its critics, it gives better placement in search results to its products over its rivals. That's the sort of thing that European Union regulators have looked at and have issued one of many fines against Google for having done.             </p><p>                The same thing could be said, perhaps, of Apple. You know, the company has an App Store; that's how you go onto your iPhone and you download games and other sorts of software. But there are lots of critics, like the streaming service Spotify, that say that Apple uses this App Store as a choke point against those that offer services that rival Apple's.             </p><p>                So it's these individual examples that I think prompt these calls for antitrust regulation.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 This is the kind of thing that Elizabeth Warren, the presidential candidate, has been talking about, as well, specifically with Amazon - right? - the idea that Amazon sells other people's products in a way that advantages products that Amazon itself sells on the same platform.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Absolutely. And Warren is perhaps the most aggressive of this 2020 field in calling for more antitrust scrutiny of big tech.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK, just the beginning of the discussion here. It'll be a long argument. We'll hear many voices in it. Tony, thanks so much for coming by.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Tony Romm of The Washington Post. And we should mention that Amazon, Facebook and Google are all funders of NPR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK. Recess is over for the House of Representatives today. And lawmakers return after a week of hearing calls to start impeachment proceedings against the president.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>NANCY PELOSI:                 Why is it that the president won't defend our democracy from this foreign threat? What is the president covering up?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF UNINTELLIGIBLE YELLS)                </p><p>NANCY PELOSI:                 The Mueller report revealed...             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 That's House Speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to talk over literal calls for impeachment during a speech to Democrats in her home state of California over the weekend. Nearly a week after special counsel Robert Mueller broke his silence on the Russia probe and whether the President obstructed justice, are more lawmakers or more voters making the same call?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Tim Mak covers national security and politics. He's here in our studios. Tim, good morning.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Good morning.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 I guess we should explain that Nancy Pelosi is not a fan of impeachment right now. But you get a sense from the boos of the crowd, the howls of the crowd, that more people might be ready for that than she would like. So what's the consensus among House Democrats?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So among House Democrats, nearly 60 are calling now for the start of an impeachment inquiry into the president. That number includes more than half of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, where impeachment proceedings would originate. But it's important to remember that there are 300 - sorry - there are 235 Democrats in the House of Representatives. So those calling for an impeachment represent a vocal and sizable group, but they're still a minority...             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Right.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 ...Among Democrats in the House. And so you hear - you get the sense there's this Tension. House leaders like Nancy Pelosi have been trying to tamp down talk about impeachment.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 One question, of course, for lawmakers is, what are their constituents telling them? What are you hearing from voters when you have traveled to one particular place, New Jersey?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Right. So we decided to zoom in on the swing districts that Democrats will need to win again in order to retain the House majority after 2020. We spoke to a number of voters about impeachment in these critical areas. Here, for example, is Barbara Petriello (ph). She's from Brick, N.J.</p><p>BARBARA PETRIELLO:                 So it scares me that we would be focusing so much on impeachment that - rather than safety and the issues that are really much more important to people sitting around the kitchen table.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So we found this kind of sentiment pretty common. Even among Democrats who support impeachment, a lot of voters told us they didn't really rank it high on their list of priorities. There's a little bit of a concern that impeachment could take up a lot of oxygen and prevent Congress from making any progress on other issues. And polling does support that - that the country as a whole doesn't support impeachment at this point. A recent CNN poll showed that support for impeachment was up slightly, but 54% of the country is still against impeachment.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 You know, you heard Barbara Petriello there say safety. She used the word - that was the thing that was concerning to her. But I'm trying to figure out what that issue is. What's she afraid of? And more broadly, what are things that voters are saying they are concerned about?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, we talked to her at greater length, obviously. And she talked about her own personal safety in her neighborhood. She talked about her paycheck, the issue of health care, whether kids in Brick, N.J., and other places in New Jersey are getting a good education, college loans.

The government releases figures for economic growth in April, May and June. Though, growth might not be the best word to describe this. The second quarter number comes out as the economy appears in jeopardy again. Now, Congress is discussing another relief package. Republicans released a bill two months after Democrats did the same. These proposals differ. And the president does not appear to be pushing for a deal. He told reporters, quote, \"we're so far apart we don't care.\"             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE INSKEEP:                 So what are the prospects for American families on the edge? NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley is with us once again. Scott, good morning.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Good morning, Steve.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 The second quarter numbers give us a chance to look back. So what are they likely to show about the spring?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 They expect to show the sharpest contraction in modern American history. Nariman Behravesh is chief economist at the forecasting firm IHS Markit. He thinks the economy shrank in the second quarter at an annual rate of about 35%.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Wow.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Steve, that would be four times the drop we saw during the worst quarter of the Great Recession.             </p><p>NARIMAN BEHRAVESH:                 It's going to be horrific. We've never seen anything quite like it.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 As sharp as the downturn was, though, Behravesh says, it was also very short. By the end of the second quarter, we began to see a resumption of economic activity. Although, to be sure, the recovery so far is both fragile and incomplete.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Oh, sure. By June, people were reopening. And now we're in the third quarter, which is July, August and September. Are we doing that much better?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 No. We're doing better. But, of course, a lot depends on what happens with the pandemic. Some businesses are more vulnerable. Others are more resilient. Behravesh describes a kind of two-speed recovery. And I've been hearing that from businesspeople I've been talking with this week. Restaurant owner Cameron Mitchell likens the pandemic to a hurricane. And he says what appeared to be a business rebound in June turned out to be merely the eye of the storm. Now he's being buffeted again by gale-force winds.             </p><p>CAMERON MITCHELL:                 It's the most prolonged, difficult operating environment I've ever been a leader in. And I've been in this business for 40 years.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Mitchell operates restaurants in more than a dozen states. His outlets in Florida, for example, were almost back to normal in early June. But as infections there took off, business dropped again. And we've seen that in a lot of businesses that depend on consumer traffic, especially in larger groups. Now, other industries are enjoying a more durable recovery. But few are back to where they were, say, in February. Factories and construction crews are picking up steam. But Americans still aren't spending like they used to. And that is keeping a lid on economic activity.             </p><p>                Looking back, though, Steve, the slowdown this spring might have been even worse had it not been for the trillions of dollars the federal government pumped into the economy. At a time when we had tens of millions of people suddenly thrown out of work, wages and salaries were offset, in a way, by those $1,200 relief payments and the supplemental unemployment benefits of $600 a week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said yesterday those payments have been an important lifeline keeping the economy afloat.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JEROME POWELL:                 In a broad sense, it's been well-spent. It's kept people in their homes. It's kept businesses in business. And that's all a good thing.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Of course, those supplemental unemployment benefits are expiring at the end of the week. And now Congress is debating what kinds of additional support families might need to keep the economy from sliding backwards.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, what possible relief is in those competing bills before Congress?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Well, there's another round of business loans under consideration, maybe some targeted help for hard-hit industries. Restaurant owner Cameron Mitchell told me that's important, or else you're going to see a lot of bankruptcies in the months to come.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 But again, no deal yet in Congress or with the White House. Scott, thanks very much.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 You're welcome.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Scott Horsley.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 What happens now that federal agents are stepping back in Portland?             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Right. That's the question now as Oregon's governor says these agents will come off the streets after many days of confrontations with protesters. Officers from various agencies were ordered to protect a federal building from protesters. But their actions appear to intensify long-running protests over racial justice. Now, the plan is for Oregon State Police to take over in hopes of de-escalating.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 How's this supposed to work? Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson is on the line. Good morning.             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 Hi, Steve.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 What's the plan?             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 Well, under the deal, Oregon State Police will take over defending the federal courthouse. They said that they're going to work with federal law enforcement and the Portland police. The idea is to get federal law enforcement to leave while also ensuring the safety of the courthouse and those who work there.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Sure.             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 You know, these federal officers don't generally do crowd control. I mean, they've made some missteps that have really energized what, prior to their arrival, were some pretty small protests - I mean, at times, you know, fewer than 100 people. For instance, a U.S. marshal shot a peaceful protester in the head with a crowd control device, putting the person in the hospital. And Oregon Public Broadcasting reported on homeland security officers in military-style uniforms using unmarked vehicles to arrest protesters. And, you know, all of this escalated what were fairly small protests into thousands of people we saw marching in recent days.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 It also had people questioning the motives of the administration. What was the president doing? How did the administration end up agreeing to back off?             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 Well, this week, Governor Brown spoke with Vice President Mike Pence. And the governor pitched Pence on this plan. Pence got the Department of Homeland Security involved. There were a number of high-ranking officials in Portland this week, including the deputy director of the FBI, before this agreement came together and was announced yesterday.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 I have to note that I heard first of this federal drawback from these state officials, from the governor. What are federal officials saying about what they will actually do?             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 Well, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf says the surge of federal officers President Trump sent to Portland is going to stay and see how things unfold. The difference is they're not going to be out there on the street unless state police can't protect the courthouse. Wolf pointed out in a news conference that many federal officers have been injured during the protests. The government has said that they have at least 114 federal officers guarding the courthouse. And in conversations my colleagues and I have had with law enforcement and the governor's staff, they say the idea is to return things to the normal level of federal law enforcement in the city.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Conrad, you've noted that the federal presence on the streets appeared to intensify the protests. Is it possible to see what might happen as they back off?             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 You know, this is really new. We don't know how protesters are going to react to this. I mean, that's been discussed conceptually. No one's seen it in action. And tonight is really - you know, we're going to see how this federal drawdown plays out.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 And the administration has been playing up this kind of conflict, as we mentioned. I mean, do we know how this might change the rhetoric on either side?             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 Well, the Trump administration has put forward this narrative of Portland as a city under siege from protesters. I mean, Trump tweeted that if he hadn't deployed federal law enforcement, quote, \"there would be no Portland - it would be burned and beaten to the ground.\" In reality, the protests have mainly taken place in an area downtown. The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful and focused on racial injustice and police violence. The hope is that federal agents stepping back will de-escalate things and return things to the conversations between community, police and the mayor.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson. Thanks so much.             </p><p>CONRAD WILSON:                 You're welcome.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 All right. One of the lawmakers at a House hearing yesterday left no doubt how he views the tech industry. David Cicilline of Rhode Island referred to the American Revolution.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 That is how the House Democrat referred to four tech CEOs who were on screens at the hearing. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai spent almost six hours fielding questions. We just want to note here that all of these companies are among NPR's financial supporters.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Alina Selyukh was listening to the hours of questions with the reputed emperors of the economy. Hey there, Alina.             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Good morning.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 What'd you learn?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Right. So the House lawmakers who called the hearing have been investigating these companies for over a year now. So what we got was a bit of a first taste of what it is that they've learned from all the interviews and documents and emails that they've collected. The hearing was pretty adversarial. But in a way, it was a tale of two hearings. One was the key focus, how these tech companies may have grown at the expense of others. For example, lawmakers grilled Facebook about how it buys or replicates rivals that threaten to lure away its users, like Instagram. Washington Democrat Pramila Jayapal read off emails between Zuckerberg and other executives.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>PRAMILA JAYAPAL:                 Do you copy your competitors?             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Congresswoman, we've certainly adapted features that others have led in, as have others copied and adapted features that we have...             </p><p>PRAMILA JAYAPAL:                 I'm not concerned about others. I'm just asking you, Mr. Zuckerberg.             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Similarly, Google has been accused by Yelp and others of stealing restaurant reviews and other content. Some small sellers on Amazon have complained about feeling trapped and dealing with confusing, ever-changing rules. App developers have accused Apple of unfairly charging them different fees. All four CEOs face different versions of the same question about how they throw their weight around to push competitors out of the way.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Well, you said this is a tale of two hearings. You've just described one. What was the other?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 So the point of this hearing was how tech companies deal with competition. But a big chunk had nothing to do with that. Several Republicans, particularly the firebrand Jim Jordan from Ohio, probed the CEOs for anti-conservative bias.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JIM JORDAN:                 Mr. Cook, is the cancel culture mob dangerous?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Jordan demanded neutrality from Google in the upcoming election and asked if all the CEOs supported diversity of opinions, which actually prompted a bit of an interesting moment. Bezos took a dig at discourse on social media, calling social networks nuanced destruction machines. I wish we could see Zuckerberg's face at that moment. But the video stream did not show him.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 How much did the CEOs really have to say for themselves?             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 They had to say a lot. But they also rejected the premise of the hearing, that they're being big bullies. They played up their humble beginnings, especially Bezos, the world's richest person. They highlighted how much people value their products and how they still face plenty of competition. Overall, the four CEOs essentially argued that any bad episodes were outliers and that their entire goal is to make their users, consumers happy. And now we wait to see what the committee thinks when they release the final findings of their investigation.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Yeah. And they're talking of regulation here at some point. Alina, thank you very much.             </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH:                 Thank you.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Alina Selyukh.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2020073018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-GGT1-DY2S-N03C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Oregon</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Gross National Product (GNP) &amp;

Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. </p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance. </p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years. </p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect,  saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\" </p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY to protect his state tax returns </p><p>NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York  officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee. </p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a  White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p> The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\" </p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights </p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings. </p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants. </p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it. </p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA - For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people. </p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes. </p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges. </p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment. </p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades. </p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills </p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday. </p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said. </p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said. </p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message. </p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation of Big Tech </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>It comes as a  number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. </p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies.

Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't  have heart disease - and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders. </p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0098403831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-PWW1-DY37-F3K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.</p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.</p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years.</p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect, saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\"</p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY to protect his state tax returns</p><p>NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee.</p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p>The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\"</p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights</p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. -- A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings.</p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants.</p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it.</p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA -- For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people.</p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes.</p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges.</p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment.</p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades.</p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills</p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday.</p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said.</p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said.</p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message.</p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation of Big Tech</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>It comes as a number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.</p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that Facebook and Google are biased against conservative politicians.</p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies. The focus of the investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>Aspirin study: Millions of people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack may need to rethink the pill-popping, Harvard researchers reported Monday.</p><p>A daily low-dose aspirin is recommended for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke and for those diagnosed with heart disease.</p><p>But for the otherwise healthy, that advice has been overturned. Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't have heart disease -- and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders.</p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study. ct19 0106 190724 N S 0000000000 00002087</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: A firefighter battles a wildfire Monday in central Portugal.

On Tuesday, firefighters brought the fire under control after the blaze raged for four days, injuring 39 people and leaving charred homes, farm buildings and burned vehicles dotted along the landscape.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">USDA rule change would cut food stamp benefits for 3.1M</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close \"a loophole\" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets. </p><p>\"For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. </p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance. </p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years. </p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect,  saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\" </p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY to protect his state tax returns </p><p>NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York  officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee. </p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a  White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p> The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\" </p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights </p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings. </p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants. </p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it. </p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA - For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people. </p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes. </p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges. </p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment. </p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades. </p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills </p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday. </p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said. </p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said. </p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message. </p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation of Big Tech </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>It comes as a  number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. </p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that Facebook and Google are biased against conservative politicians. </p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies. The focus of the investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. </p><p>Aspirin study: Millions of people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack may need to rethink the pill-popping, Harvard researchers reported Monday. </p><p>A daily low-dose aspirin is recommended for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke and for those diagnosed with heart disease. </p><p>But for the otherwise healthy, that advice has been overturned. Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't  have heart disease - and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders. </p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0098405285</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-PWW1-DY37-F3MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FOOD STAMP PROGRAM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Public Health &amp;

I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RACHEL MARTIN:                 And that is the voice of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, making his opening statement late yesterday at his confirmation hearing. And if that was all you heard from the hearing, you'd think it was pretty pro forma. It definitely did not start out that way, though.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID GREENE:                 No, it did not. As soon as Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley began the hearing - as soon as it started - Democrats on the committee interrupted, claiming they did not have enough information to fully vet Kavanaugh. Grassley let Democrats say their piece, but he rejected their motion to delay. Today, committee members will get a chance to question Kavanaugh directly about his judicial record.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 All right, NPR's Scott Detrow was following the hearing yesterday, will be doing so, I assume, today and joins us now in the studio.             </p><p>                Hey, Scott.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Good morning.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So Democrats, as David noted, tried valiantly to get this delayed from their opinion. Chuck Grassley, though, wasn't having it - was he?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He was not. And it really depends on what your definition of success was here. Did the Democrats delay the hearing? No, they did not. What they did do was spend close to two hours at the beginning of this hearing highlighting an issue that has really frustrated them all summer. And that's - they say they just haven't had a chance to look at Kavanaugh's full track record in the Bush White House, which was a key period in his career.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 There was some posturing by some potential presidential candidates as well. Right?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, I don't think it was an accident that the very first Democrat to cut in was California Democrat Kamala Harris followed closely by New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota - all viewed as possible 2020 presidential candidates. Their concerns were certainly legitimate from their point of view, but they were certainly aware that this is the rare Senate hearing that's being covered wall-to-wall.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 I mean - they say they haven't had the documents to vet Kavanaugh. But would anything in those documents convince these Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Probably not. A lot of these Democrats have already said they're not going to vote for him at all. But I think one thing that you're probably going to hear about today is an issue that Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin flagged in 2006, when Kavanaugh was nominated for the federal bench for the first time. Durbin asked him at a hearing whether Kavanaugh had played a role in the Bush White House in any conversations about those enhanced interrogation techniques, as they were called at the time. Kavanaugh said no. Later, it came out that he had had some of those conversations. Durbin's certainly going to focus on that today. He feels like he was lied to in that 2006 hearing. And Democrats say that's a perfect example of why they need to see everything Kavanaugh was doing in the White House.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 What else did those opening statements yesterday tell us about the kinds of questions Kavanaugh is going to face today?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I think you're going to hear a lot about policies like like abortion rights. Kavanaugh would be replacing Justice Kennedy, who was the swing vote on abortion rights cases for decades. Health care is going to come up a lot as well. You're going to also hear a lot about executive power. Kavanaugh has written in some legal journals that he thinks that a sitting president shouldn't have to deal with subpoenas, criminal investigations - which is quite the view for someone who worked on Ken Starr's investigation of President Bill Clinton. But Kavanaugh said his mind had changed. That's certainly a very relevant topic right now as President Trump and the White House are being investigated by Robert Mueller.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Which is what Dick Durbin also pointed out. It was almost - as Durbin was painting it, didn't matter who was sitting there as the nominee. The fact that this person has been tapped by this president, who is currently under investigation - it creates some baggage for this particular Supreme Court nominee.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's right. Many Democrats were saying - if the president's under investigation, if this White House is under investigation, if there's a good chance that some sort of question about the scope of that ends up before the Supreme Court, that should be taken into consideration. And some Democrats were arguing Trump shouldn't even be making a pick under those circumstances.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 All right, NPR's Scott Detrow for us, who will be looking at Day 2 of the Kavanaugh confirmations that come up today.             </p><p>                Thanks so much.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 All right, it's one thing when a former staffer with an ax to grind writes a tell-all book. But when half of the reporting duo that broke the Watergate story turns his focus on you - well, it's a different and perhaps more damning story.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 That's right. This is Bob Woodward. And the first excerpts from his new book about the Trump White House began to circulate yesterday. Woodward paints this picture of a factional West Wing but one more or less united by a low opinion of their boss. Over hundreds of pages, Woodward reportedly documents efforts by senior officials to subvert or delay the president's wishes if they see them as politically damaging or threatening to national security.             </p><p>                Now, Woodward spoke to President Trump after he had finished the manuscript of the book. He recorded that phone call, and here's just a bit of their exchange.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>BOB WOODWARD:                 You know, it's a tough look at the world and your administration and you.             </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. But you know, I'm some - I'm sort of 50 percent used to that. That's all right. Some are good, and some of are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 All right, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here. Mara, the through-line, as David noted - at least in these excerpts - is that top staffers have been trying to work around this president, trying to blunt some of his more extreme decisions. Right?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 That's right. That's one of the things that really stands out in the book. The book does echo similar stories of dysfunction and chaos, disparagement by top officials. But also, it shows top officials trying to protect Trump from himself or trying to protect the country from him. And it's deeply reported. It has these vivid scenes. And it seems to really corroborate what we've been hearing all along about the Trump White House.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Can you walk us through at least one of these specific examples?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, for example, top White House officials removed paper - Gary Cohn, top economic adviser, removed a piece of paper off of Trump's desk because he thought that if Trump signed it and removed the United States from an agreement with South Korea, it would be bad for national security.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 There's also another anecdote of Trump's lawyers running kind of a mock Q&amp;A with him to imitate what a Mueller investigation interview would be like and those lawyers then saying the president essentially failed that experiment.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right. And it quotes John Dowd, the president's former lawyer, as telling the president that he should not testify - he should not be interviewed by Robert Mueller because \"it's either that or an orange jumpsuit.\"             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 How's the White House responding to this, if at all?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, John Dowd actually denied saying that. White House chief of staff John Kelly denied calling the president an idiot. That's also in the book. The secretary of defense, Mattis, said that he never uttered the words that were attributed to him in the book. The president denied having any papers taken off his desk.             </p><p>                But what really struck me about the White House response was how it seemed less intense than the way they responded to Michael Wolff who wrote \"Fire And Fury\" or Omarosa Manigault Newman. It's harder for the White House to undermine the credibility of Bob Woodward, someone who's won two Pulitzer Prizes and has never had his reporting debunked.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 One more thing to get to with you, Mara - the New York Times reported last night that special counsel Mueller has informed the president's legal team that he would accept some answers in writing from the president on whether or not his campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 election. What can you tell us there?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, several news organizations are reporting that Bob Mueller has said, yes, he would accept written answers about possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. What we don't know are the conditions under which Mueller would accept answers relating to questions of obstruction of justice. And we know this big tension about whether the president should sit down with Mueller figured in the Woodward book. And we don't know...             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Whether or not that's been decided.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 ...What is going to be the resolution of these negotiations.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Right. NPR's Mara Liasson.             </p><p>                Thanks, Mara.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 OK, David - just down the hall from the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill today, another big hearing is going down with some equally big names.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Yeah, really big names. You're going to have Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. They're going to be appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. They have come to Washington to address how their companies have responded to the threat of hacking and foreign influence campaigns ahead of the all-important midterm elections - and whether their response has evolved over time.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 All right. We are joined by NPR's Tim Mak in the studio. So Tim, as David said, these people have answered these questions before. What have not - what haven't they answered yet? I mean, what are the questions lawmakers still have to put forward?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. They're going to be answering questions on how seriously they're actually taking the threat of foreign influence operations on social media. And there is an increasing sense of seriousness amongst a lot of big tech firms about how their platform could actually be used against American democracy. Facebook, for example, is going to emphasize how they're doubling the number of people that they're hiring and employing to work on safety and security issues.             </p><p>                But there's one big firm that won't be there at all. And that's Google, which has declined to send founder Larry Page or its CEO to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee. And there's a bipartisan consensus from Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Co-chairman Mark Warner that Google's offer to send its chief legal officer was actually insufficient. So during today's hearing, we're actually expecting an empty chair to be placed in the room to represent Google's absence.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Oh, wow - a little theater there. So I mean, do you get the sense that these companies are taking this threat more seriously. I mean, it requires admitting a vulnerability - right? - or requires them admitting, oh, we weren't doing it all right before.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. Facebook in particular is trying to make a good faith effort towards transparency in addressing some of these concerns. And some of this is driven by the nature of the threat. There's no sign it's actually diminishing. This past month, we had Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter - all announced they discovered new foreign influence operations. Iran was revealed to have created a worldwide disinformation campaign. And on top of that, we saw new Russian disinformation campaigns and apparent hacking attempts. People are on red alert.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So what is Congress's role here? I mean, they have suggested that there might be some kind of regulation they could put in place to help these companies, to hold them account. Is that really in the offing?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 They're considering everything from new online ad disclosures or tougher automatic sanctions on foreign actors like Russia. But the big question is whether or not this is the kind of thing that could be solved by legislation. The threat is super multidimensional, everything from hacking to bot networks to disinformation campaigns to election infrastructure security. And some of this can be solved by people using things like multifactor security on their emails and being just more judicious about what they read online and what they believe.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Right. The onus is on us, the users...             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Absolutely.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 ...To some degree.             </p><p>                All right, NPR's Tim Mak for us this morning on those Facebook and Twitter hearings happening on Capitol Hill today.             </p><p>                Thanks so much, Tim.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Thanks a lot.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF EVIL NEEDLE'S \"VIBIN' (FEAT.

The former special counsel spent almost two years examining Russia's interference in the election and confirmed it. He also examined possible obstruction of justice by the president. Mueller found numerous acts but said a sitting president could not be indicted. Having said that, he explicitly appealed to Congress not to call him to testify.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT MUELLER:                 Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Or it was, until today.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 NPR Justice reporter Ryan Lucas has been covering this investigation from the beginning. Hey, Ryan.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Hello there.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So everybody wants something today, right? Let's run down the list. What do the Democrats want from Robert Mueller?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Well, Democrats have been angling for this day for a very long time. They were actually yesterday holding a mock testimony with aides to prepare for it. So there's been a lot of buildup. But as of late, there's also been an attempt to kind of tamp down expectations as to what we would hear from Mueller. Mueller, of course, is famously straight-edged. He's made clear, as we heard, that he didn't want to testify, doesn't want to stray beyond what's in his report.             </p><p>                Speaking to Democrats last night, they say, that's OK. Remember, Mueller's final report, it's very long. It's dense. It's written by lawyers. It's not approachable for a lot of people. And it's not something that a lot of Americans have read. Democrats think that having Mueller speak in public on TV with clips that will run on loop on cable will reach a far greater number of Americans than his written report has to this point.             </p><p>                They want to use their time to focus on several episodes of possible - of obstruction of justice by the president. They also plan to dig in on contacts between Trump associates and Russians that are documented in the report, put a spotlight on the campaign's willingness to accept Russian help. They want to highlight those things, bring them to life for the American people.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK. So the Democrats hoping to get a lot out of today's testimony. What do Republicans want?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 In many ways, for Republicans, the status quo is a good thing. They want to protect the president. They want to emphasize the fact that Mueller did not charge anyone for conspiring with Russia. They're also expected to raise questions about the integrity, the even-handedness of the investigation itself. They have been pushing allegations of political bias on Mueller's team for months. We've heard that over and over from them. They've also alleged that the FBI committed surveillance abuses against the Trump campaign. Some of the president's most ardent supporters are on these committees, and they may go after Mueller on those exact issues.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So he's going to appear before two committees today, House Judiciary and House Intelligence. We're expecting about five hours of testimony in all. Are we going to hear Robert Mueller say anything new?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 That's a good question. And frankly, it's pretty much up to Robert Mueller himself. He has made clear, as we said, doesn't want to be here, doesn't want to testify, doesn't want to say anything beyond what is in the report. The Justice Department in fact sent him a letter with guidance this week that his testimony should not go beyond what's in the report. That includes discussions about investigative steps or decisions that his team made, which is something that Democrats have expressed interest in.             </p><p>                The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, sent Mueller a letter yesterday lambasting the DOJ about this, said the administration was essentially trying to obstruct a legitimate congressional investigation. And he said it should have no impact on Mueller's testimony. It would be a major accomplishment for either side to get something new out of Mueller. But again, neither side is really banking on that.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And just really quickly, Mueller did something interesting here. He asked for one of his top aides to sit next to him today and assist him. What's the significance there?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Right. That top aide is Aaron Zebley. He will be at the hearings today, caused a lot of stir on the Hill. But what this may boil down to is essentially big, sprawling investigation, Mueller may need some help with the details.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK. NPR Justice reporter Ryan Lucas. Thanks, Ryan.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Thank you.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And you can follow more special coverage of the Mueller hearing on NPR member stations, npr.org and later today on All Things Considered.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK. The Justice Department says it is investigating the power of some big tech companies.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 It's an antitrust investigation. In announcing this probe, federal prosecutors did not name names. But they seem to be talking about the likes of Facebook and Amazon and Apple and Google, the really big ones. Congress has already been questioning those companies over privacy protections, allegations of bias and the spread of false information.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 NPR tech correspondent Aarti Shahani is on the line from Silicon Valley. Hey, Aarti.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Hi.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. So let's start with this antitrust review. That was the DOJ's words. What does that mean? What are they looking into?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 So the key issue is whether these companies we all know and use are stifling competition. There's a school of thought that says if a product is free, that's fantastic for consumers. You can't beat free. Who cares if its maker is a monopoly? But that is coming under attack with this other school, that free isn't really free.             </p><p>                In the case of Facebook or Google, the user who provides the data has been turned into the unwitting product. In the case of Amazon, small businesses that sell on the platform have to pay to play, advertise to be seen. And then their data gets turned into corporate intelligence for Amazon to drive them out of business. Apple may be giving its developers who are the heart and soul of the App Store a raw deal. So the Justice Department is going to look into whether small businesses, would-be startups and consumers are getting harmed and also how these companies got to be so big. Were laws violated along the way?             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So have any of the companies said anything about this?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 In response to NPR's inquiry, Google pointed to its testimony in Congress last week. Google's head of economic policy made the case that his company creates lots of opportunity for others. Its advertising tools have helped small businesses grow, and its employees have gone on to build more than 2,000 startups. In the case of Amazon and Apple, they didn't immediately respond to NPR's request. But Apple made the case that its App Store is safe and trusted for customers and also great for developers. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has pointed out that other businesses are selling more to customers on his site than Amazon is.             </p><p>Facebook declined to comment, though they have also said before they face vigorous competition from other platforms. I would note, at two separate hearings, also last week, one of Facebook's leaders was making the case that regulators should let the company make its own digital currency. So while the government's worried about tech giants being too big, Facebook is trying to get way bigger.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Facebucks (ph) - Libra, actually.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yes. There you go.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. So now that this review is underway, what's, like, the next step? What happens next?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 This isn't a quick turnaround. There's no clear timeline on how long the Justice Department will take. And two examples from the past point to wildly different outcomes. AT&amp;T, which started with a DOJ review, was formerly broken up. Microsoft, also brought into court and lost, ultimately was not broken up. So what we know for sure is that big tech will stay a major political issue throughout the coming months.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 NPR's Aarti Shahani. We'll be talking to you later today. Thanks again, Aarti.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. We have an update now on a Pennsylvania school district that threatened families over unpaid student lunch debt.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 It's the Wyoming Valley West School District outside of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Dozens of parents there owed the school a total of $22,000 for lunches. Officials threatened to put kids in foster care if their parents did not pay. Since NPR first reported the school's debt collection efforts, several donors have stepped forward to settle the cafeteria tab. But that has not ended the story.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 NPR reporter Bobby Allyn has been chasing this story down. Hey, Bobby.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Hey.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So someone offered to pay the debt for the kids. Who was it?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 So five people actually stepped forward to clear this tab. And one of them was a prominent media figure who wants to remain anonymous...             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Fair.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 ...But, you know, was so outraged by this story that tried to reach out to these school officials and, you know, get rid of this delinquent meal debt. But county officials are not responding.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 They're not responding - they're - so people have come forward and said, we'll pay the kids' debt, and the school's just got nothing to say about that?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Yeah. It's the really weird part. A lot of people, when they first heard that, you know, there were donors out there who were willing to get rid of this school debt, that that would be the end of the story. But now we know that, no, (laughter) that's not the end of the story. And, in fact, besides the prominent media figure who I just mentioned who wants to take care of this debt anonymously, there's another person who tried to intervene who actually had the same exact experience.             </p><p>                It's this guy, Todd Carmichael. And he's the chief executive of the coffee roasting company La Colombe. They're based in Philadelphia. And he told me about growing up poor and being raised, we know, with three siblings by a single mother outside of Spokane, Wash. And he said, you know, being shamed about not having enough money to pay for a meal is something he actually experienced as a kid himself. And threatening to take parents away, to - or, you know, threatening to take kids away from their parents is just something that made him really, really angry.             </p><p>TODD CARMICHAEL:                 You know, you're threatening people who are struggling with taking their children because they can't pay for the hot lunch. This kind of drives against everything that I believe is decent and good and American and friendly and neighborly and who we are as a people.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 I mean, I know you've been talking to school officials. Do you have any idea why they're just blowing off these donors?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 It's really hard to say because officials have gone into bunker mode. I mean, I have contacted them seven, eight times over the past day, and they're just not getting back to me. You know, Carmichael and the other donors say they're just mystified about this whole situation. I mean, the district, Wyoming Valley West, which is in the Poconos area, you know, is one of the poorest in Pennsylvania. So you'd think officials there would be receptive to donations worth tens of thousands of dollars, right?             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Yeah.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 But Carmichael has his own theory about what's really going on here. He says this really isn't about money at all. He thinks it's about teaching people who are struggling some kind of moral lesson, no matter what the consequences are.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Oh, that is interesting. All right.

Just after 3 p.m., a rented Home Depot truck swerved into the Houston Street bike line along the West Side Highway, located in the lower part of Manhattan. The attack took place not far from the site of the Sept. 11 attacks. After striking multiple pedestrians and bikers, the driver crashed into a school bus near Chambers Street. Of those struck when the truck turned into the bike line, six were presumed dead at the scene and two more died at the hospital. Two children and two adults on the bus were wounded, but none of them fatally (New York Times, \"Terror Attack Kills 8 and Injures 11 in Manhattan,\" 10.31.2017).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the crash, the driver, Sayfullo Saipov, got out of the truck and ran through traffic, waving a paintball gun and a pellet gun. After yelling \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is great\" in Arabic, he was shot in the stomach by New York Police Department officer Ryan Nash on Chambers Street (CBS News, \"'This Was An Act Of Terror': 8 Dead, More Than A Dozen Injured When Truck Strikes Pedestrians In Lower Manhattan,\" 10.31.2017).</p><p>The motorist is still alive, but is in police custody. The attack has been compared to the terrorist attack in Nice, France last year, in which a different motorist struck those celebrating Bastille Day.</p><p>Saipov, who is 29 years old, came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010. Prior to the attack, Saipov, a New Jersey resident, did not have a criminal history, and his only law violations were traffic-related. When he moved to the United States seven years ago, Saipov worked driving cars and trucks and recently begun driving for Uber, for which he passed the background check.</p><p>Law enforcement officials have concluded that Saipov was \"self-radicalized\" because he did not have ties to the terrorist organization, despite being inspired by it. This was further supported by findings of a note by the vehicle, reading \"ISIS Lives Forever\" in both English and Arabic. Saipov, who spent a year planning the motor attack, also requested that an ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room. On Thursday, Nov. 2, ISIS took credit for the attack that it had inspired (NBC News, \"Sayfullo Saipov's Path from Immigrant Trucker to Suspected Terrorist,\" 11.01.2017).On Tuesday, Oct. 31, there was a terrorist attack in lower Manhattan, near the location of the Sept. 11 attacks. Eight people were killed and several more were injured. The perpetrator, Sayfullo Saipov, is alive and in custody, awaiting trial./ Courtesy of Pixabay</p><p>Normally, presidents of the United States are discourgaed from providing their opinons on unsettled criminal cases, as these thoughts can interfere with the trial. However, President Trump tweeted his response to the attack, stating that \"In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!\" This was later followed up by another tweet reading, \"He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!\" (New York Times, \"Trump Declares Suspect 'Should Get Death Penalty,'\" 11.01.2017).</p><p>-Pazit Schrecker, Guest Reporter</p><p>Mueller make first indictment charges</p><p>Ever since Trump's election, tremendous suspicion of Russia's involvement in the election is omnipresent in the news cycle, which eventually led to a federal investigation. This week, incriminating information about key figures from Trump's foreign policy sector of the campaign revealed potential collusion between Russia and the United States.</p><p>The first indictment charges were made under the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller last week. The investigation is focusing on potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia that gave Trump his November victory. Those from Trump's campaign who were charged were scheduled to be taken into custody as soon as Monday. However, these charges were sealed from the public eye. Mueller's sealing of the documents sends a signal to other defendants that these are serious allegations worth decades of jail time (CNN, \"First on CNN: First charges filed in Mueller investigation\", 10.30.2017).</p><p>The indictments include Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, all former Trump campaign aides. Manafort and Gates, who are longtime international business associates, were the first to be indicted on 12 counts, including conspiracy to launder money on behalf of the campaign. Gates and Manafort were both ousted from Trump's inner circle amidst rising suspicions about their lobbying work in Eastern Europe, especially in the Ukraine (Washington Post, \"At least nine people in Trump's orbit had contact with Russians during campaign and transition,\" 11.5.2017).</p><p>According to their indictment, Manafort and Gates funneled millions of dollars to the United States from consulting a Ukrainian presidential campaign. The seemingly democratic candidate Victor Yanukovych had close ties to Vladimir Putin. Gates was found to have opened as many as 30 bank accounts this year alone-one with over $10 million dollars in Cyprus-which constitutes massive tax fraud (CBC News, \"How cases of Paul Manafort and Sergei Magnitsky are linked: money laundering through Cyprus,\" 11.04.2017).</p><p>This week, it was discovered that Papadopoulos, a seemingly low level advisor to the campaign, was trying to set up meetings in Moscow with the Trump campaign. Evidence in Mueller's investigation suggests that Papadopoulos may have been directed by higher campaign members to spark collusion between the campaign and Russian authorities, including Vladimir Putin. It was later discovered that he sent emails to other campaign aides, notably Manafort and Gates, working on Trump's foreign policy about collaborating with Russia. In an email sent from Manafort to Gates, he wrote, \"We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal\" (NPR, \"Former Trump Adviser Admits To Seeking 'Dirt' On Clinton From Russians, Lying To FBI,\" 10.30.2017).</p><p>Although he went to great lengths to skirt around Trump's national security, the 29-year-old Papadopoulos confessed to lying to the FBI about his relations with Russia. However, the exact question of the Trump campaign's alleged illegal collusion with Russia remain unanswered. Mueller's investigation suggests that the Russians had disclosed they had important, and perhaps incriminating, information about Hillary Clinton. These illegal meetings never happened, as the campaign claimed to have refused them.</p><p>The Trump administration tried to stop the investigation but ultimately failed. Furious after receiving notice about Mueller's strong prosecution advocating for electoral justice, Trump's tweet read, \"This is the greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\" (CNN, \"Trump 'seething' as Mueller probe reaches former aides,\" 10.31.2017). In the upcoming weeks, the Mueller probe will continue to uncover the hidden truths behind Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>-Kelly Vinett, Guest Reporter</p><p>Congress holds hearings for tech giants</p><p>Last week marked the start of Congressional hearings for the biggest tech companies in the country in connection to their role in Russia's meddling in 2016 presidential election. On Tuesday, Oct. 31, and Wednesday, Nov. 1, three of the tech giants, Facebook, Twitter and Google, had to defend themselves in front of Senate in a series of three hearings over the two days. The hearings were conducted to investigate the role social media played in the 2016 presidential election and the extent of the reach and influence it had. It was the first time that tech companies testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the role they played in the elections. While the senators were hoping for a conversation with top executives, the corporations instead sent their in-house lawyers, putting themselves on the defensive.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Intelligence Community jointly confirmed Russian government interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. One of the tactics was the use of social media to spread controversial and divisive messages, focusing on race, religion, gun rights and gay and transgender issues in the U.S. They used Facebook in two ways: firstly, by paying Facebook for advertisements and secondly, by creating Facebook groups where they promoted divisive messages and encouraged debate. The Russian government influenced the election by using Facebook's own strategy of encouraging people to be more engaged, by commenting, liking and sharing content. It has been revealed that a shadowy Russian company with links to the Kremlin, Internet Research Agency, posted around 80,000 pieces of divisive content that reached 19 million people between January 2015 and August 2017 (The Atlantic, \"15 Things We Learned From the Tech Giants at the Senate Hearings,\" 10.02.2017). These posts were then shared, liked and commented on, spreading them to an even wider group of people. Moreover, Internet Research Agency paid Facebook more than $100,000 in advertisements (Reuters, \"Facebook says 126 million Americans may have seen Russia-linked political posts,\" 10.30.2017).</p><p>Last week's hearings presented a shift in the relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley. For years their relationship has been very friendly, especially in regards to favorable regulatory treatment of Silicon Valley. However, the hearings revealed the increasing frustration with Silicon Valley in Washington. This was apparent in the line of questioning from Minnesota Senator Al Franken, who asked Facebook's general Counsel Colin Stretch: \"You put billions of data points together all the time ... you can't put together rubles and a political ad? How did you not connect those two dots?\" (Reuters, \"U.S. senators hammer Facebook for power over elections,\" 10.31.2017). The past month has also seen a circulation of Senator Amy Klobuchar's bipartisan Honest Ads Bill, which would require political ads on the internet to be regulated in the same way as those on TV and radio (Business Insider, \"McCain, Democrats introduce first major legislation targeting Facebook ads since Russia intervened in the 2016 elections,\" 10.19.2017). Facebook has taken some steps to change its practices when it comes to political ads in order to avoid regulation from Washington and has hired 1,000 new people to review political ads. The argument for self-regulation has been present in the discourses of all the big tech companies.</p><p>-Marusa Rus, Guest Reporter</p><p>ISIS loses control of Deir al-Zour</p><p>Last Friday, the Islamic State suffered an important defeat by Syrian government forces, Iraqi militaries and international backers of both armies and lost much of its territory.</p><p>Syrian forces declared victory in Deir al-Zour, the last major city held by ISIS. The city is regarded as an important place geographically and economically; it is near the Iraqi border and has abundant amount of oil. As a result, the Syrian government and ISIS had an ongoing territorial dispute over the city. Deir al-Zour has been divided into a Syrian portion and an ISIS portion for three years (Independent, \"ISIS Driven Out of Final City Stronghold in Syria,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>However, allied with Russian and Iranian army, Syrian forces started to besiege Deir al- Zour against ISIS and have been moving forward ever since. Finally, last Friday, they succeeded in recovering control over the city (Independent, \"ISIS Driven Out of Final City Stronghold in Syria,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>\"The armed forces, in cooperation with allied forces, liberated the city of Deir al-Zour completely from the clutches of the Daesh terrorist organization,\" Syrian state media reported, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS (Reuters, \"Islamic State on Verge of Defeat After Fresh Losses in Syria, Iraq,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the border, the Iraqi military allied with Iranian army took over al-Qaim, the border-crossing city near the Euphrates River. Iraq's Prime Minister Haidar Abadi announced that government forces succeeded in seizing power over the city (Independent, \"ISIS Driven Out of Final City Stronghold in Syria,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>After these defeats, ISIS is now isolated in the small desert countryside surrounded by its opponents. Indeed, it has lost 90 percent of its territory in the last three years, including key cities such as Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria (Reuters, \"Islamic State on Verge of Defeat After Fresh Losses in Syria, Iraq,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>Syrian forces against ISIS anticipated that a few more wars are left in order to annihilate ISIS influence on territories. They estimated that ISIS does not have many soldiers left; around 1,500 to 2,500 soldiers are estimated to remain in al-Qa'im and 2,000 to 3,000 in Abu Kamal (Independent, \"ISIS Driven Out of Final City Stronghold in Syria,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>Refugees from Deir al-Zour and al-Qa'im were also relieved by the victory. Hosna Quray'a, a refugee from Deir al-Zour who has stayed at a school shelter in Qudsaya, commented to The New York Times, \"I want to return. Most of my relatives left there, and I don't know what happened to them\" (The New York Times, \"ISIS, Squeezed on Two Sides, Loses Syrian City and Border Crossing,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>However, there are several obstacles to the fully recover the lost territory and to wipe out ISIS's power. To begin with, the war is not finished yet. Both the Iraqi and Syrian government are cautious about guerrilla attacks of ISIS (Independent, \"ISIS Driven Out of Final City Stronghold in Syria,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>Moreover, for the refugees, the victory does not mean they can immediately return to their homes. The cities may still contain numerous land mines and ISIS sleeper cells. It will also take a huge amount of time to rebuild the destroyed cities again (The New York Times, \"ISIS, Squeezed on Two Sides, Loses Syrian City and Border Crossing,\" 11.03.2017).</p><p>Finally, the political conflicts among the militaries would be a critical concern in the aftermath of the war.

They are Democrats Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar.

Now, how is the president explaining himself? NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is with us once again. Domenico, good morning.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Good morning, Steve.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK, so he begins by saying these people mostly born in the U.S. should go back. They're people who are from here but just of a different race than him. And then he came out and made a statement - the president did - saying, well, what I meant was if you don't like America, you can leave. But isn't he pretty much saying the same thing?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right. I mean, the president showed no contrition, essentially, for racist remarks. He instead - he emphasized them. He said, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. Now, the rhetoric has gone too far for many Republicans. They're voicing disapproval of the president's remarks. They're also criticizing the congresswomen, though, calling them socialists or far-left or, quote, \"anti-Semitic\" - using anti-Semitic rhetoric.             </p><p>                Most of them, though, stopped short of calling the tweets racist. You heard from Will Hurd of Texas, who is black, who called Trump's tweets racist, as did Mike Turner of Ohio. But others like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah - they called the remarks, you know, destructive, demeaning, disunifying and, also, over the line, which I guess, Steve, means there is a line.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Oh. Well, interesting to learn that. Why would the president go over that line, then?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You know, the fact is the president and the Republican Party want to elevate these four congresswomen to make them the, quote, \"face of the Democratic Party\" - you heard Lindsey Graham say that on Fox News yesterday, for example. You know, they think that that is something that helps them because it makes the Democratic Party look far-left. Ayanna Pressley argued that the congresswomen's views are not total outliers.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>AYANNA PRESSLEY:                 Our squad is big. Our squad includes any person committed to building a more equitable and just world. And that is the work that we want to get back to.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 I guess we should define some terms there. They've been called the squad, these four freshmen members of Congress. And when she says, our squad is big, she's referring to - she's asserting that, actually, they have a lot of support; they're not just four freshmen.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right. And the fact, though, is that within the Democratic conference, they've had some disagreement with leadership, with Nancy Pelosi, whether it's tactically or ideologically. But for now, I have to say, this helps Nancy Pelosi. It's a pretty big gift to her to maintain unity because, instead of the focus being on that Democratic infighting, it's on Trump. And Pelosi is now calling on Congress to condemn Trump's remarks and wants to put Republicans on record.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Although, the way that Republicans will spin this is, look - all the Democrats have now been glued to these four lawmakers that we want to describe as socialist and so forth. So what does this mean for the 2020 election?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, they'll certainly attempt that. But this whole incident's a reminder that identity politics are going to be, unavoidably, a top issue for 2020. Republicans and the Trump campaign are happy to have it that way. They think it helps them. They think it throws the left off balance.             </p><p>                But stepping back, Steve, the fabric of the country is really being stretched. I mean, you have demographic change in this country that's upsetting half the country, while the other half is painting in primary colors, emboldened. They feel under siege by Trump. And, you know, it's unclear what it's going to mean for 2020 at the ballot box next year, and it's even cloudier for our culture and what it means to be American.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 One of the questions, of course, will be who gets the half or a little more than half or a little less than half? Domenico, thanks so much.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You're so welcome.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 That's Domenico Montanaro. Now, amid all the attention on the president's racist language, his administration continued its push to reshape immigration policy.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Yeah, that's right. Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a new rule for migrants from Central America who want to get asylum in the U.S. They first have to apply for asylum in a country that they traveled through on their way to the United States, and if they're rejected by one of those countries, only then can they seek asylum here. Now, that rule is scheduled to go into effect today, and it will certainly face challenges in court.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Reporter James Fredrick is in Mexico City and covering this story. Hey. Good morning             </p><p>JAMES FREDRICK:                 Morning, Steve.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 So I'm trying to figure this out - if you show up at the U.S.-Mexico border and say, I'm seeking asylum, is the asylum officer, the federal agent there, going to say, OK, prove to me you tried in Guatemala first?             </p><p>JAMES FREDRICK:                 Exactly. I mean, what this establishes is that, if you show up at the U.S. border now to request asylum, basically, you're not - ineligible unless you can prove you've tried to apply elsewhere and have been rejected. So, I mean, this applies to everyone who's coming to the southern border. The administration says that this policy is to crack down on what it calls fraudulent asylum claims. But the result is that someone who could have been granted asylum yesterday had they been able to apply, well, today that same person can't even apply and could be deported to their home country.             </p><p>                In terms of who this affects, we're talking mostly people from Central America. But it's not just them; it's anyone who's come through Mexico. I've met people from as far as Venezuela, the Congo, Ukraine who have come through here to apply for asylum. It would affect all of them. And the question now is how - what this looks like on the ground. One question is what do they do with people who break this rule now? Will they deport them to their home country, to a place where they say they're not safe? That's a big question right now.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Now, I want to think this through. First, we should note - this is kind of normal, that you encourage people to just go one country over and stay near where they came from. I mean, refugees from Afghanistan end up in Pakistan or Iran, for example. So it's not that unusual to have the impulse to say, if you're fleeing El Salvador, maybe you should go to Guatemala, maybe you should just go to Mexico, you should go somewhere nearby. But that does raise a question - can people get asylum? Can people be safe in Guatemala or Mexico?             </p><p>JAMES FREDRICK:                 In theory, yes. In practice, in a place like Guatemala - Guatemala officially does allow asylum-seekers, but it doesn't have an office to even process that. So, I mean, the capacity for it just doesn't exist right now. In Mexico, it's a bit different; Mexico does process tens of thousands of asylum requests a year. The problem right now is that Mexico's asylum office has an annual budget of $1.2 million. They've already had 30,000 asylum requests this year. They just have nowhere near the funds to resettle more people or even the number of people who are requesting asylum right now. So practically, it just doesn't seem feasible in other countries like that.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Have Mexican officials indicated they're going to try to deal with this?             </p><p>JAMES FREDRICK:                 They have not said anything. They mostly said that this is a domestic policy in the U.S., so they can't challenge it. But what they're going to do is a big question because this would be a huge burden on them to take tens of thousands of more people, possibly.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Reporter James Fredrick, in Mexico City. Thanks, as always.             </p><p>JAMES FREDRICK:                 Thanks, Steve.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK, wow - three congressional hearings today in Washington, three of them, put the power struggle between Congress and big tech on display.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And when we talk about big tech, we're talking about a handful of companies - Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple. Some members of Congress are concerned about the influence that these companies have over billions of people's lives. And today, lawmakers get to question executives from those companies.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 NPR's Aarti Shahani will be listening and is on the line. Good morning.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Good morning.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 OK, let's start with Facebook, which is the sole focus of a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Why banking?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That's right. So you may have heard Facebook plans to create its own money called the Libra. The stated goal is to bank the unbanked. An estimated 1.7 billion adult on Earth do not have a bank account; many of them are Facebook users. So Facebook is going to create its own currency, taking on a key power of nation-states - the power to mint money. But Facebook has got to clear a lot of hurdles. What are they and their partners going to do about money laundering? How will they protect privacy? What happens to the interest earned on Libra deposits?             </p><p>                Regulators are speaking up about it and striking very different tones. France's finance minister came out saying Facebook shouldn't have a sovereign currency. The U.K. minister says his country is willing to engage with Facebook. And U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin made it clear in a briefing yesterday that he is not comfortable with Facebook launching a currency, at least not yet.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN:                 I think they're being very candid with the administration in where they are. I'm not going to publicly speculate how long I think it will take them to get to the point where we're comfortable with it. But they are a long way away.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Facebook by now, of course, has heard some of the criticism. How are they responding?             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 So the company is sending David Marcus. He's heading the creation of this Libra wallet. He used to head PayPal. His testimony, which he submitted, it's very diplomatic. He's going to say Facebook will not launch Libra until his team has fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals. So, you know, it seems like, at least today, Facebook is talking the talk.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 And we'll find out how the walk goes a little bit later.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 (Laughter) That's right. That's right.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 In the House, some lawmakers are asking if some of these companies amount to monopolies.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That is correct, and there is an entire hearing today that's really dedicated to how these platforms work. The House Judiciary Committee members are going to drill into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple - how they deal with competitors and collaborators.             </p><p>                And, you know, Steve, here's the thing - is that these companies do have differences. For example, Amazon and Google both collect advertising money. But Amazon's ad money is basically a fee to vendors for them to show up in Amazon's search pages; Google is not that. As one person close to the companies pointed out to me, it is in each of their interests to not point fingers at each other, to not throw each other under the bus. They'll want to stick together and make the antitrust conversation go away.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Kind of act like, I don't know, a big tech monopoly or something like that.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 (Laughter) Well, and coordinated - coordinated, correct.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 (Laughter) Coordinated messaging - that's something different, I know, I know, I know.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Yes.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Third hearing is about what actually gets carried on social media and what allegedly gets blocked.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 That's right. That's right. Senator Ted Cruz, he has long criticized social media platforms for anti-conservative bias. Today, he's going to grill a Google lobbyist, specifically, on whether the company is tweaking its algorithms, manipulating search to suppress certain ideologies. So, again, does big tech have too much power?             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Can't wait for people to be googling the results of that hearing to see whether it comes up.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Aarti, thanks so much.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Thank you.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 That's NPR's Aarti Shahani.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF STAN FOREBEE'S \"REFLECTIONS\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2019071619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-KD01-DY1J-T379-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidents &amp;

BEADLE, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AND RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. We might get started. Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. My name is Tom Beadle. I cover the Australian TMT space. And as part of that, I'm the lead analyst for News Corporation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it's my pleasure this morning to introduce you to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations at News Corp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as a reminder, before we get started, we do have the conference app here, please feel free to enter questions into the app. We're also going to go a bit old school here. We'll have a mic around -- floating around the room, so we'll be taking questions from the floor as well. So...</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN, SENIOR VP &amp; HEAD OF IR, NEWS CORPORATION: Good to be here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: So I guess, just maybe a high-level question first. The key strategic priority for News Corp seems to have shifted to simplifying the structure recently. So can you talk about some of the initiatives and maybe an update on NAM and Unruly and just maybe talk about some of the other key priorities of the News Corp over the next 1 to 3 years?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Okay. Well -- good question, Tom. So let's start with just the high level because I do think, kind of looking at where we come from is very important to maybe where we're going. And when I joined the company, when we separated from the old News Corp, I mean we were a company that was -- almost 3/4 of revenues were in newspapers and -- News and Information Services. The vast majority of our EBITDA was in News and Information Services, and the nickname that we were given was PubCo.</p><p>And when you look at how the business has changed, we were -- we tripled our exposure to digital real estate. That's become a very big part of our revenue and EBITDA. We've expanded HarperCollins. We exited Digital Education. So the business has changed. Advertising, which used to be 49% of our revenues was, I think less than 1/3. The subscription and circulation, what I call the recurring subscription base has come from, I don't know, I think it was 25% at the time we separated and now it's our biggest revenue stream. So the business has transformed far differently than people expected. And today, we have a business that has a very good balance between News and Information Services, Digital Real Estate, the Book Publishing business and obviously, real estate.</p><p>So going back to your question, I'd say, so the priorities for us. When I look at our segments, what are we trying to accomplish? One, in News and Information Services, it really is about becoming much more digital, streamline the cost base, big focus on Dow Jones. At digital real estate, it really is about expanding into adjacencies, growing our audiences. And I think we've done a very good job on that. At Foxtel, we get to a lot of questions on and you'll probably ask a question later, but on Foxtel, it really is about IP, pushing IP more aggressively. And in Book Publishing, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. And when I think about that business, that really is a content business. It's not a book business -- it's not just a book business, it really is about content.</p><p>Now on your question on simplification. The way I think about it, with everything we do, there's always a review of our asset base. And looking at the portfolio and what are the best levers to drive growth and value. When it comes down to something like News America Marketing or in whatever -- any of our businesses, I kind of break it down into 3 questions that you got to answer. One, is it an area that you want to reinvest in? And what kind of return will you get on it? Two, does it cloud the value or detract the value of the segment? So in this case, Dow Jones. I mean Dow Jones is a really, really important asset for us. And one that, candidly, I think, is worth a lot more than The Street might think. And so how do we better highlight that to some extent? And then the last part is, are there broader synergies? Or how great are the synergies across the rest of the portfolio?</p><p>So with News America Marketing and Unruly, we have both -- both are under sort of strategic review, and we'll update the market when something's finalized. But it clearly is a big focus and one that if I think about News and Information Services, today, that segment is pretty balanced now between revenues and circulation. If you were to exclude News America Marketing, as an example, all of a sudden, a vast majority of the revenues become subscription and circulation, really starts to change the revenue exposure of that business. And I think it gives a heck a lot more transparency into the business. And -- but again, a big part of the focus is how do we best highlight Dow Jones.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Yes. And I guess, maybe on that point, so the business has returned. Dow Jones has returned to low single-digit growth over the past couple of years. So maybe if you could talk about what's driving this and what initiatives you're undertaking to grow revenue further. And maybe just as a comp -- compare yourselves to maybe your competitor like a New York Times for example?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Yes. That's a great question. So when I think about -- like last quarter, we'll take the first quarter, our fiscal first quarter. Our revenue growth at Dow Jones was 6%. That's a really good number. When you think about how -- what the drivers are that -- the biggest revenue bucket at Dow Jones is consumer circulation. Consumer circulation revenues grew 6%. We had, I think it was, 17% growth in digital-only subscribers at Dow Jones. The Wall Street Journal total subscriber growth grew 8%. Those are really good numbers inside the consumer side of the business.</p><p>For us, advertising grew modestly, grew 2%. We had a very good quarter in digital. And then on the institutional business, one area that [we] probably need to give a little more attention to, that is what we call the Professional Information Business. That grew 8%. That's the best growth I can recall in recent memory. And the real driver of it is the Risk and Compliance business. And the Risk and Compliance business is an area that, I think in fiscal '19, revenues exceeded $130 million. When we separated, it may have been $20 million or $30 million. That is a very big focus. And I guess -- I look at the marketplace for Risk and Compliance, I think globally, that's a $60-plus billion market in the next -- over the next couple of years. So it's a huge TAM and one that we are a player in.</p><p>And so I think when we stack up versus the New York Times, a, we have a very big institutional presence that they don't and none of our peers do. So it very much differentiates us. When I think about our consumer revenues, again, first quarter, consumer circulation grew 6%. I think that's higher than the New York Times. On digital for us, digital is over 40% of -- digital advertising at Dow Jones is over 40% of total advertising. And importantly, from a profit contribution standpoint, we've been improving our profitability. And so it is -- I think we have a different strategy than New York Times, but I'm very proud of what we're building at Dow Jones.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: And could you maybe -- I guess maybe elaborate on that strategy. The differences in your strategy, so...</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Well, I mean I think that, look, from a Times perspective, clearly, and I don't really want to talk too much about Times. Clearly, it's been much of a volume story. I think ours is very balanced. If you look at our pricing structure as an example, our pricing varies from $38.99 to $44.99, very different price point than New York Times. And what it means is that from -- and as you kind of drill down to the financials, our subscriber revenue growth has grown 6%. I think that's probably almost double. They were 3% or 4% in the first quarter. So look, it's a different strategy. Our pricing point is higher. We may be a little bit more of utility to some extent. But I think we have lots of levers to grow growth. And I think we've come a long way.</p><p>And just as another example of that is the Wall Street Journal today, 71% of the subscribers, at least as of fiscal first quarter, were digital-only. That's a very big number that I don't think -- I'm not sure there's any peer that has that level of digital exposure. And also, if I look at the whole company, about 65% of Dow Jones revenues are digital today. It is a digital -- it is a very much of a digital company.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Look, maybe -- Robert Thomson has spoken about, in the past, about the negative impact of the digital duopoly, in other words, Facebook and Google on general digital growth. And I guess in the past year, there's been some positive developments, such as the removal of first free click requirements on Google. You recently announced a partnership with Facebook. And earlier in the year, you also announced the deal with Apple. So how does this change, the game, not just the News Corp but the publishers more generally? And I guess what more could be done?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Right. So I think you're seeing, in at least, the beginnings of a fundamental shift between the relationship between the publishers and big tech, beginning. And I have to say, I give a lot of credit to Rupert, Lachlan and Robert Thomson for getting there. We're not all the way there, but we're making progress.</p><p>Look, our goal has been to make sure premium content, our journalism is protected and rewarded. And I think, for too long, big tech has used our content to drive audiences and advertising and there has to be some change. So you are seeing, both from a public perspective, the U.S. regulators globally, the global legislation. I mean you are starting to see a change and also from us. There's clearly been an issue and that's now starting to change.</p><p>So as it comes down to working with Facebook, they're clearly starting to see some sense of -- sort of sensibility in terms of subscriptions. They're starting to support it, hopefully, with the news tab feature, being able to work with Facebook. When I look at Facebook, there's a licensing fee, right? Carriage fee, call it. And there's upside in advertising and subscriptions to the extent that someone clicks on the headlines that we're providing, they'll come to -- it will be in our -- they'll go to our platforms. So it's a very important step. I can't say it's all the way there. But from where we were a few years ago, when we talked about the idea of a carriage fee, I had mentioned to investors and it sort of seems like a crazy idea. It happened in the cable industry and the broadcast industry partly because -- and very much because of the old News Corp. And now you're starting to see the beginnings of a carriage fee that we had talked about 2 years ago. So more needs to be done.</p><p>I mean if I think about -- I came from advertising. That's where I started my career way back when. And when I was in advertising, you wanted to have lots of media to use. And it wasn't down to 2 platforms when it came to advertising. And so from an advertiser, there clearly is -- the marketplace is very opaque and you want to see changes. And I do think that there is a heck a lot of value in a verified trusted content like ours. And hopefully, we'll start to see changes. But look, I think over the last 12 months, we've seen a big change. And for us, the Facebook deal in and of itself will have an impact on our financials this year. And it's just the beginning, and hopefully, we can layer that in with hopefully other deals. And it is the beginning of a new revenue stream for us.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: This is the one and we are taking questions from the floor. If anyone has any questions? All right, we might move on then. Just I guess where we're on News and Information Services, maybe we'll just do an around the ground throughout the other countries. And maybe starting with the U.K. It looks like things are improving there. Can you maybe talk about the drivers of that improvement? And I guess, how should we think about the evolution of News UK over 3 to 5 years?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: It's a good question. So if I think about today, and I look at the first quarter, and I look at things on, obviously, putting aside currency, which has issues with us -- for us. But advertising in the U.K. grew on a local basis, 6%, which is the best in recent periods. So we had very strong growth and very much it was -- print was fairly stable if not improving a little bit and the real growth came from digital. And particularly The Sun was a particular -- had shown particular strength. Audience for The Sun is now globally, 129 million. I think we've overtaken in the U.K., at least the Mail. So we're seeing really good progress. There's still more to be done, but we've seen really good progress. The Times continues to grow subscribers, had a really good clip. And digitally, I think we grew high teens, The Times and digital subscribers. Now over 50% of the subscribers are digital-only. So we made a lot of progress.</p><p>And I look at categories, it's all -- it really does vary quarter-over-quarter. Finance and legal happen to be a big category for us. Retail was okay. I think it improved a little bit, but still there are challenges in retail. But you then have seen -- what I really like what I saw in the first quarter was the growth at The Sun. And so very hard to predict and visibility is still fairly limited, but it was a real progress at the U.K. And the biggest challenge for the U.K. was the Tabcorp, the settlement that they had in the prior year. Excluding that, they are really one of the highlights for us in the first quarter.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Maybe moving to Australia. So you're seeing soft revenue trends in local currency terms. And I guess to what extent is the weakness in advertising revenue, structural versus cyclical versus I guess, maybe a sort of macro-driven? And I guess, how far until we reach that tipping point where digital might outweigh print declines.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Yes. I mean, I think, look, we're not alone in the trends we saw in Australia. I mean Australia, the economy has been has been tough. I mean when GDP is growing 1.4%, and confidence isn't great, you see it. I mean customer -- consumer confidence has a lot to do with it. But look, when I look at Australia, there -- some of it's cyclical, some of it's structural. When you look at the categories, what are the categories that were most vulnerable to? It was employment, it's classified, it's retail, it's real estate, all kind of makes sense. Now how much of that decline is cyclical versus structural, probably a little bit of both.</p><p>And for us, the key is to push digital as aggressively as we can. And we've actually done a pretty good job. News.com.au, I think, for 2 years now is the #1 news site in Australia and is doing very well. Our News Xtend, our small, medium business solutions product is doing very well, and it's diversifying that revenue stream.</p><p>When I look at -- clearly, a very big focus for us in Australia is on paid subscriptions. And last quarter, we had over $500,000. I think it was 540,000 of our masses were digital subscribers. The Australian, I think, 2/3 of the Australian subscribers are now digital-only. So we've made a very -- real good progress. I think -- when I think about the -- when I think about all of Australia, it's really about -- it's about the metro media, the metro mastheads, The Australian, news.com.au, those are the businesses that clearly have a much bigger digital opportunity than the community and regionals. And while we do this, we have to continue to look at the cost base, any cost that we can, wherever we can streamline costs, whether it's operations, whether it's distribution, whether it's production, you have to take a look at that because it is about making sure you've got the right cost base for the future.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Yes, that's probably actually a good segue to just talk about cost across the News and Information Services segment more broadly. Maybe if you could just provide an update on the cost reduction programs. I know you've sort of -- you've mentioned sort of the areas of focus in Australia, but also, I guess, other countries as well.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Yes. So I mean I think when I break out the costs, when I think about the segment. So overall, for us, in the first quarter, our costs were down about 4%. And if I break that down, and when we -- where we prioritize, we are investing in Dow Jones, right? And we should be because there are multiple levers of growth. And that one is -- and I think we talked about the expenses at Dow Jones grew less than our revenue growth in the first quarter. So if you think about mid-single-digit -- low to mid-single-digit type revenue expense growth.</p><p>When I look at the U.K. and Australia, it is about really kind of focusing on the costs. While you're investing in digital, you've got to look at every cost. So at the U.K., we've seen really good progress on the cost side. It's -- again, it's production, it's distribution, it's marketing where we can. It's really looking at everything to make sure we are balanced.</p><p>And I think in Australia, it's the same. I mean we're sharing our content where we can. But we spent a lot of time looking at and making sure that we have the right cost model, and there's more to be done there. And so that clearly is a big focus, but it really is bifurcating that Dow jones you invest in and the others. You certainly invest in digital, but you've got to make sure your print costs are as low as possible.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Just before we move on. I guess talk about some of the other businesses. Are there any questions from the floor on news and info services? We've got one at the front here.</p><p>HAROLD VOGEL;VOGEL CAPITAL INC.;ANALYST: Customer acquisition cost, what is the trend on that? And also, I assume newsprint cost is going down because you're using [it] as payment. Can you comment on that? And what proportion of that is [overflown]?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: So -- by way Hal Vogel was a professor mine at Columbia Business School, about 20-some-odd years now. So a very good question. He always asks good questions.</p><p>Look, on the SAC, we don't get into. I would say that when we look at SAC, how you -- the subscribers we're adding are very nicely accretive. They are NPV positive. So when you think about like the newsroom, we think about the journal in particular, you do -- hopefully, we'll do a little bit more in social media, but they are positive.</p><p>Now you keep an eye on churn. Churn in digital is higher than in print because print, we tend to have much more longer-tenured subscribers. As it relates to your other question, newsprint is fairly small. Newsprint prices have started to come down. And you're right, there's both -- there's a variable component of it. As volume comes down, newsprint also comes down. But also, we start to see the newsprint prices starting to come down as well. But they're not -- as a percentage, newsprint is -- wouldn't be that significant as a percentage.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Are there any other questions from the floor? Okay, we might move on. Maybe we'll move on to digital real estate services. I think maybe we'll start with Australia. I guess REA's sort of have been a very highly successful business and arguably the jewel in the crown. Can you just talk about the strategy to continue to grow REA in Australia, just given it's already the clear #1 player?</p><p>And just in particular, touch on their new lead-based products, maybe if you've got any initial feedback from takeup from agents. And also, I guess, longer term, how could REA potentially monetize leads?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Yes. It's a great question because you're right. We're #1 in the market. And you always get -- how do you continue to grow? And when I look at REA, clearly, listings are a factor. But the kind of -- the growth that -- the growth drivers are really about how you continue to push debt penetration, and I think there are plenty of opportunities for us to do so. It's looking at a number of products. I mean we've got whether it's Agent Elevate, Agent Match, which is the selling -- which is in its early days was audience maximizer whether it's adding in lifestyle content -- there's a lot that, from a product standpoint, that we have continued to do. And many of those front page, another example. Many of them are in the very early days. So it is about kind of debt penetration and learning on new products.</p><p>Then it's also about using data. I mean the Hometrack acquisition was great because we have access to all this property that we had not before. And so what we're doing is we're building a really powerful database that we didn't have before. And how do you leverage that to drive both the industry and customer adoption?</p><p>Then I look at the mortgage brokering business. I mean that is in the early, early days. And that's another way of leveraging leads. And how do you better monetize leads? And so -- then outside of Australia, you've got -- you have exposure to Southeast Asia through iProperty, which is also in the early days. So I think REA has lots of levers to grow.</p><p>Now you mentioned the sell lead, Agent Match. It's in the really early days. I mean we're in the days of learning and testing and learning. But it's clearly a big -- hopefully, a very big opportunity for REA. It's just -- it's very early at this point. But it's another way of thinking about the business and how do you better monetize leads going forward. And right now, we're sort of building a pipeline of leads and really getting reviews from the industry.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Yes. And I think -- is it worth just maybe highlighting, for the audience here, just to what extent the soft Australian listings environment has been a drag on revenue and sort of what revenue -- sort of revenue and say, a per listing basis, has sort of done, if you sort of -- if you took out these macro drags?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Well, it's always tough to predict out the macro drags. I mean, for us, listings aren't clearly a lever of growth. And look, in the last 2 quarters in particular, it's been unusual. First quarter, we had, I think, 15% listing volume declines. And I think revenues were down $8 million. Now part of that, there was an increase in deferral revenues from going related to the Premier All product. But still, I mean, it is a factor. Now -- and it also depends on geography, right? So if the 2 biggest markets, the highest yielding markets are Melbourne and Sydney. If those are down, then they also have an impact.</p><p>So look, the last 2 quarters have been unusual. We're starting to see, at least, and we talked about sort of gradual improvements. We have seen Melbourne and Sydney, at least based on sort of the industry data that we see, is starting to get less bad. We're also managing the cost base. So when we do see recovery, I think we'll be in a pretty good place. And so I think second half comps, as a former analyst, I can look at it and say we had second half comps, I think industry listing volumes were down, I think, 9% in the third quarter, and I think fourth quarter, it will be down 19%. So we're -- very unusual territory. And again, managing the cost base is the right thing to do.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Maybe we'll just move on to the U.S. now, in digital real estate services. So you made your biggest acquisition move 5 years ago, yes? Can you provide an update on how this business is performing? Maybe talk about how that it moves differentiating versus CLO and also how the Opcity acquisition fits in.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Yes. So look, I mean, I think when we acquired REALTOR, we always -- I always get questions from investors, how do we differentiate? And what are we doing to differentiate from Zillow? Obviously, we have relationship with the NAR. Our listings were updated more frequently. And so we're differing -- and we had different types of products. But clearly, Zillow seems to be very -- getting much more aggressive in the home segment and the house flipping segment. It's not an area that we're particularly interested in. It's much more capital-intensive and not the pipe business that we are focused on.</p><p>For us, it really is the biggest part of our revenue is the buy side. And today, it's through connection plus product, where we were essentially subscriptions -- we sell subscriptions to the industry by ZIP Code. They could be exclusive or nonexclusive. That's been the biggest part of the business. They've been unqualified, we just sell leads. Now the next phase is really exciting. It's the Opcity. So Opcity, what it does is Opcity is based on -- it's a performance-based model. And we will qualify the lead and then connect, in almost real time, with the agent that's most likely to convert. And there are algorithms and there's learning built into to Opcity. And so that's the next phase where we're moving from a marketplace of -- there's a wide range of estimates of what the real estate marketplace is, whether it's $8 billion to $10 billion. There's a wide range to one that is going after the $60 billion to $80 billion commission pool through a performance-based model. So working with the industry, we're hopefully making it easier for them to as we provide leads that are more likely to convert. And that's a very big focus of realtor now is moving from just the unqualified lead to one that is really performance-based. And I think it's very exciting.</p><p>What we've been doing is testing Opcity in over a dozen markets, testing what would be -- in most markets, we offer the Connection Plus, the unqualified lead product, the lead gen product and the Opcity product. In most markets, we offer both, and over a dozen markets, we're offering just Opcity. And seeing how that goes. So far, it's early, but the tests are very favorable. And we're seeing an uptick in meeting rates, uptick in conversions, uptick in home values. So, so far, so good. It's early days, but one that we're watching very, very closely.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Maybe more sort of broadly speaking on the Digital Real Estate Services segment. Robert's spoken about his ambition for News Corp to become a global player. So could you maybe talk about your strategy across the sort of -- the more global portfolio of assets?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Right. It's a great question. So -- and when I think about the frame, for those that don't follow News Corp too closely, to frame it, Digital Real Estate generated almost $1.2 billion of revenues last year and almost $400 million of EBITDA. So this is, I think, by most metrics, we're the largest in the world. And we recently moved Tracey Fellows, who was the CEO of REA Group, to be the President of our Global Digital Real Estate. And also, she is the interim CEO of REALTOR. So clearly, that in of itself shows the commitment that we have by bringing someone like Tracey to oversee the -- our digital real estate portfolio.</p><p>And when I think about it, we have global scale that most don't have. We have the ability, through this network, to see what verticals perform well. To see where you want to access or allocate capital. There are certain markets that you can test things and certain markets that may have been more favorable than others. But it gives you a learning that you'd -- that most companies don't have. And so from an IP perspective, there may be some opportunities, from a shared learning perspective, there are opportunities. And when I step back and I look and see, REA is probably the most profitable digital real estate company in the world, my guess. And to be able to import some of that learning to a realtor, I think, is really important. So the more that we can share best practices, I think the better off we are.</p><p>And we have exposure, not just through -- if you think about it, it's Australia, it's the U.S., it's the Southeast Asia through iProperty, we have a minority stake in India through [Elara]. So we really do have a global presence. And to have someone now accountable for the whole segment and where we want, as a company, to allocate capital, I think, is very important.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Cool. May I just take this opportunity to check if there's any questions from the floor on digital real estate before we move on to some of the other segments? Okay. Cool. Maybe we might move on to Foxtel. Maybe just -- if we start with, maybe can you provide an update on your new IP products? Obviously, an update on Kayo Sports, which was launched about a year ago now? And also the new entertainment app. And maybe we can just -- if we could talk about how the economics stack up versus Foxtel's cable.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Right. What a great question, and clearly, a very big focus for Foxtel is pushing OTT or IP, in part because -- and when the contribution margins and the margin of the product were leveraging the cost that we already have and amortizing over a bigger base.</p><p>And so -- and think about what we're trying to do, Kayo, which is our sports streaming service, which we launched at the end of November a year ago. I mean I only give -- as the first quarter -- oh, I guess that's in November 5, we had over 400,000 -- I think it was 402,000 paying subscribers. I think it was over 440,000 including trialists. So that's a pretty good -- in less than a year, to have scaled it at over 400,000. And these are not $6.99, $7.99 subscribers, and the retail rate for Kayo starts at $25. So you really are at the higher end. And I think we've done a really good job. And so it's early days still, and we'll see kind of what the ultimate TAM is and how much market share we can go after.</p><p>But the reality is, I think they've done a really good job. I mean to have 400,000 on a base of, we have over 3 million -- 3.1 million total subscribers, including IP, that's starting to really scale and that's what we want to see. And it's still early days, but a very big focus for us.</p><p>As it relates to the entertainment, we have Foxtel Now, which I view as more of a mirror of broadcast to some extent, more of a complement to broadcast. The -- what we have talked about, we haven't given the specifics yet, is an entertainment product, which we expect to launch sometime in the fiscal year. But again, it's going to leverage the content we already have. And so that clearly is a very big focus for Foxtel. And it is the core -- the growth engine of Foxtel. There's lots that you can do from a cost side. There's opportunities on churn, but really kind of pushing OTT is sort of what I view as the single biggest growth driver for Foxtel.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: You mentioned cost there a couple of times. And obviously, it is a key focus. So I guess there's a lot of moving parts in FY '20. So maybe if you could -- could you touch on that? And also, more broadly, how should we think about the cost of sports rights going forward? You've obviously locked in and have some key content for the next few years.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: So I think if I think about all Foxtel, the cost, the biggest cost for fiscal '20, there are 2 items that really are the driver of it. One is, and we've talked about this on our earnings call, there is some noncash amortization related to how we amortize feature programming -- some of the feature programming. It's -- again, it's noncash. That's $30 million to $35 million. We have one additional quarter of domestic Cricket. Recall, we had bought the domestic Cricket rights a year ago, which we had in the first quarter. So now going forward, it should be like for like with some very modest escalators.</p><p>If I think about Foxtel, because there's a lot of other stuff we're doing. The overhead costs have started to come down. There are opportunities on the transmission side, which we can talk about. But overall, it's really that the noncash costs are probably the biggest factor. Outside of that, costs would be relatively stable. So it's mostly driven by that, right? All the puts and takes, that's probably the biggest factor from a cost standpoint.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: I want just to check with the floor if there are any questions on Foxtel, before we move on to -- I want to touch on a couple of other segments and I know we're running out of time. Cool.</p><p>Maybe if we just may move on to Book Publishing quickly. That business has held up remarkably given the potential headwinds this business faces. So why do you think this is the case? And should we be thinking of this as a publishing business or as a content business?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: So the latter part of your question to me, that's the way I think about it. And what I mentioned earlier is when I think of Harper, it's clearly a book business, but at the same time, it really is about the content. I mean we have a library of over 300,000 titles across, I think, 17 different languages. And so it really is about IP.</p><p>And one of the things that we're looking at is -- and thinking about it, how do we expand beyond that, right? Beyond just the core business? Audio book is [a] business that emerged out of nowhere a couple of years ago to be a real big contributor for us, for -- on digital revenues perspective. Now how do we think about outside of just the book business? And so we have a deal with Sony we're working on where we will participate in an upside from literary work through the former Fox 2000 team. I think it was Elizabeth Gabler.</p><p>And we also have a deal with Bell Media to monetize some of the Harlequin titles and these made for TV films. And so thinking about that more holistically, I think, is really important because it really is about IP. I mean we own the content in perpetuity in many cases. And so how do we better leverage that beyond just the audio or e-book or physical book? So we're very -- it is a business that we're very excited by.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Yes. And I guess how -- broadly, more broadly speaking, how would you think about the evolution of this business over the next 3 to 5 years? And I know, even strategically, like you've done a deal in the past in China, albeit not that big but could you maybe elaborate a bit on that?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Well, I think, look, any quarter -- like year-to-year, it can vary. Like this year we talked about, we do face tough compares this year, and we have a number of titles that are much more second half weighted. We keep an eye on retail because that's something that also can change over time. Barnes &amp; Noble has a new owner that we keep an eye on. But when I think about -- it is about making sure that you have the right mix of titles. And I think about the fiscal last year, it was really about -- it was very much about having the right titles. And if you have the right titles, you can have significant operating leverage.</p><p>And look, it will be tough over the next couple of years. I think sort of the nonbook business will become a bigger part of the business. It'll be interesting to see digital revenues for us today. I think last quarter, they were 22%. Where can that go longer term? Particularly as you think about this explosion of content, whether it's streaming, whether it's podcast. I mean these are all opportunities, whether it's subscription-based models. These are all opportunities that HarperCollins theoretically could be participating in. So I do think of it very much of a content business.</p><p>And when I think about the right compare, I mean the nice thing about Harper is like in any given quarter, you could have half of your revenues already accounted for through the backlist. So -- and it's a business that does not require a lot of CapEx and one that I think has plenty of long-term potential.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: I might just check to see if there's any questions on Book Publishing? Maybe one final one for me. Just a more general question, just around capital management. You've got $1.7 billion net -- of cash sitting on your balance sheet outside of the borrowings relating to Foxtel and potentially more if you do end up selling assets. So how are you looking to deploy this?</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Right, so that's a question that we certainly get a lot. And for us, I mean we are a company that is going through, as I mentioned, at the starting point, we're a company that is going through change. And if I think about the investments we made, I mean the biggest investments have been in real estate and book publishing, either Harlequin or REALTOR or even REA through the iProperty acquisition.</p><p>So I do think, for us, reinvestment is very important. We're trying to shift the narrative of the company to one that is much more of a digital-first company. But at the same time, I think look, we should look at all levers. I mean, I think at the end of the day, I mean, we have a very good sense of what our value is. We know very clear where the disconnects are. And I know Robert's talked a lot about sort of some of the parts and how do we best narrow that gap. Not only narrow the gap but grow the NAV. And so in the past, it really has been about reinvestment and are there opportunities that can do both, that close and grow. That's the way I think about it.</p><p>THOMAS G. BEADLE: Okay. Great. Are there any final questions from the floor? Okay. Looks like that's it. Mike, thank you very much for coming in. And all the best.</p><p>MICHAEL FLORIN: Great. My pleasure.

A voluntary code is the right way to go.\"</p><p>While the \"devil is in the detail\" when it comes to changing media regulation, Mr Marks threw his support behind changes that would level the playing field.</p><p>\"The general thing for me is the government's tone and their obvious commitment to making this happen is to be congratulated and I'm really pleased that they've got on the front foot,\" he said.</p><p>Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton also welcomed the majority of the response, saying in a statement that addressing outdated content requirements would bring certainty to the industry.</p><p>\"The urgent need for regulatory equality between foreign digital platforms and Australian companies has been recognised by the Government. We see this as a real turning point, as for too long legislation has lagged well behind technological evolution, disadvantaging Australian companies and providing foreign digital platforms with a free ride,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said the network was disappointed that the government had not backed a take-down scheme that would've required material infringing copyright rules to face more stringent requirements.
