Regulators are divvying up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants, and lawmakers are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potential antitrust investigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Lawmakers in the House said Monday that they were looking into the tech giants' possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that did not exist when antitrust laws were written.</p><p>The question of whether tech companies violate antitrust laws has long been the subject of academic debates and industry griping. But now the industry is in the sights of President Donald Trump, Democrats running for president, Congress and consumers. Silicon Valley has faced fierce criticism over disinformation, privacy breaches and political bias.</p><p>Investors pummeled technology stocks Monday. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7%. Google and Amazon shares were also sharply lower, and Apple's stock fell about 1%.</p><p>It does not appear that the agencies have opened official investigations. But the scrutiny from Washington could lead to years of headaches for the companies, raising the prospect of lawsuits to break up companies, hefty fines or new laws limiting their reach.</p><p>\"This is about how do we get competition back in this space,\" Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Monday at a news conference. Cicilline is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, which during the next 18 months plans a set of hearings and testimony from executives from top companies, as well as subpoenas for internal corporate documents.</p><p>Cicilline said the investigation would focus on major digital platforms. The House committee Monday informed four tech companies -- Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon -- of the plans. If the House investigation finds wrongdoing, lawmakers will pressure the Justice Department or the FTC to investigate, he said.</p><p>\"This is long overdue,\" he said.</p><p>The FTC and Justice Department declined to publicly comment Monday. All four companies also declined to comment, though they have rebutted accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the past.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the Justice Department and the FTC began negotiations over dividing up the responsibilities for overseeing competition in the tech sector, according to several people close to the discussions.</p><p>The two agencies often split responsibilities for reviewing mergers. But the recent negotiations show that both agencies were keen on looking into the companies, and that they had probably received complaints from rivals and others.</p><p>Two people close to Trump said White House officials were supportive of the agencies' steps toward greater antitrust oversight over tech companies.</p><p>But the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, insisted there was no direct pressure on the agencies or involvement from Trump or any top West Wing officials. The officials attributed the moves to Trump's appointees at the agencies.</p><p>It could be years before regulators take action or Congress passes new antitrust laws. Some consumer groups have called for regulators to break up the companies, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has said the company must be broken up in order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the breakup of any tech company.</p><p>Talk of antitrust is suddenly fashionable, but efforts by the government to break up companies have been rare, time-consuming and not always successful.</p><p>The government's case against IBM went on for 13 years before being dropped. The pursuit of AT&amp;T lasted a decade until the company was broken into the seven Baby Bells. The government chased Microsoft for 12 years, from the first FTC investigation until a settlement was approved by an appeals court.</p><p>One reason for the slow pace: If you are big enough to be drawing antitrust heat, you're big enough to have a lot of lobbyists, lawyers and employees in congressional districts all around the country.</p><p>In recent decades, a reinterpretation of traditional antitrust theory created a major barrier to regulatory action.</p><p>Robert Bork, a former federal judge and conservative legal theorist, argued in his 1978 book, \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" that if the government protected weaker competitors, it would make businesses less efficient, raising prices for consumers.</p><p>His consumer welfare standard -- all that counts is what happens in the consumer's wallet -- has been widely used by courts, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>This interpretation of antitrust helps big tech companies. It is difficult to argue that consumers are being robbed -- the argument made by the Senate for passing the original antitrust laws more than a century ago -- when companies like Google and Facebook do not charge users. Amazon prides itself on charging low prices.</p><p>\"Federal enforcers have a lot of catching up to do,\" said Sarah Miller, deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that is critical of the giant tech companies.</p><p>The antitrust law in Europe is more receptive to the recent complaints about large tech companies, and critics of the businesses have pursued actions there.</p><p>European regulators fined Google 1.5 billion euros (about $1.7 billion) this year for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. It was the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-69P1-JBP6-R35R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With the chief executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon arrayed on screens in front of him, the firebrand Republican congressman let rip: \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said, referring to Google's \"censorship\" of far-right sites such as Breitbart.</p><p>Mary Gay Scanlon, a Democrat, hit back. \"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than conspiracy theories,\" she said. Jordan began yelling. The gavel pounded. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat, screamed: \"Put your mask on!\" It was an unedifying moment in an otherwise momentous day. The hearing in front of the House judiciary's anti-trust subcommittee marked the first time the bosses of America's tech titans - minus Microsoft - were together asked the same questions: are you too big? Are you abusing your power to crush competition, hurt consumers and undermine society? The answers were rehearsed and broadly clung to a similar, if tenuous, argument. But what was clear was that this hearing was different to previous ones, which were often hastily organised affairs in response to a specific scandal. Congressmen were better prepared. They asked tougher questions. Committee chairman David Cicilline was clear: \"These companies have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated.\" There is reason to believe he will follow through on his words with a crackdown on Silicon Valley.</p><p>The anti-trust - or anti-competitive - movement has its roots in the early 20th century when government began breaking up monopolies in telecoms, rail and oil.</p><p>But the challenges posed by the Silicon Valley behemoths are very different. The reason those powers have not been exercised is that since the late 1970s, a shift in anti-trust orthodoxy made the concept of consumer welfare the guiding principle.</p><p>The idea was that unless customers were getting gouged, there was no harm - but given that on the internet so many of the services are free to the end user, the concept is no longer fit for purpose. A revamped regime is likely to take a more expansive view of harms, to include predatory pricing and other anti-competitive behaviour as reasons to fine, penalise or even break up the tech giants.</p><p>The hearing traces back 13 months, to the first week in June. Up to that point, none had ever been investigated on antitrust grounds, aside from Google. Within hours of each other, however, Cicilline's committee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice each launched anti-trust probes into all four.</p><p>Which led to last week's public flogging. The four companies are together worth $5 trillion ((EURO)4.2 trillion), sit atop a cash mountain of $420bn and last year generated $770bn in sales. Yet the tycoons who run them all attempted to paint their companies as the plucky startups they once were. \"Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, plaintively. \"History shows if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.\"No one seemed moved by his argument, or really any of the points that the chief executives attempted to get across. But their answers weren't really the point of the proceedings. The hearing was an exercise in framing: to cast a group of disparate companies as slightly varied shades of the same threat. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon may operate in different markets, but they are all gatekeepers with the power to set the rules for companies that must go through their platforms to reach customers.</p><p>A year of digging by Congress has yielded 1.3 million internal documents. In emails, executives unguardedly talk of \"land grabs\" and \"neutralising\" threats, providing the ammunition for lawmakers no longer willing to take Big Tech at its word. The Department of Justice is understood to be weeks away from filing its own anti-trust lawsuit against Google.</p><p>Congress's resolve to bring the sector to heel was no doubt buttressed on Thursday, when Amazon, Apple and Facebook all posted \"blow-out\" financial results for the three months to June. Facebook doubled profits to $5.2bn despite a 1,000-strong advertiser boycott. Alphabet, Google's parent, saw sales decline for the first time in its history, dropping 2% to $38bn, though its $7bn in profits still beat Wall Street expectations. Apple and Amazon posted record quarters.</p><p>Each of the companies is vulnerable in different ways. For Apple, it is the App Store. The iPhone giant charges companies 30% for any money spent on or in apps that operate on its phones, iPads and computers. The European Union launched a market abuse inquiry into the App Store last month after Spotify complained Apple had hobbled it, forcing it to pay 15% of its income (the rate for subscription services after the first year). With Amazon, politicians were interested in whether it mines the data of the companies that sell via its website in order to develop its own rival products. The company opened an internal probe after a Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 revealed the practice.</p><p>Google is expected to get hit over the same issue: operating a marketplace while also participating in it.</p><p>Facebook was framed as a paranoid crusher of competitors, with much of the queries revolving around its two most important acquisitions: the takeover of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Congress cited emails that laid bare Zuckerberg's ruthless streak.</p><p>The veil has been lifted. Silicon Valley will no longer be able to pass off those predatory tactics as consumer benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-162039006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-NGW1-DYTY-C3PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The four companies are facing legal and political offensives from Congress, the Trump administration and federal regulators, as well as multiple American states and European watchdogs.</p><p>Although none of the chief executives was present in person, appearing via video link instead of sitting in a line before the congressmen, the event drew comparisons with the 1994 \"Big Tobacco Moment\", when top executives from the seven largest American tobacco companies sat side-by-side in front of a congressional panel and denied that cigarettes were addictive.</p><p>Mr Cicilline, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, began proceedings by stating that \"while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.\"</p><p>The four companies were already enormous before the American economy was shut down in March because of the pandemic. \"In the wake of Covid-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before,\" Mr Cicilline said. \"As hard as it is to believe, it is possible that our economy will emerge from this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated than before.\"</p><p>Although \"several of these firms also harvest and abuse people's data\", consumers find there \"is no escape from the surveillance, because there's no alternatives.\"</p><p>He concluded: \"As gatekeepers of the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and Continued on page 34, col 1 Continued from page 31 enrich themselves while choking off competitors. Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors and inspire fear represent the powers of a private government.

Mr Bezos, 56, reminded the panel that Amazon owns less than 1 per cent of the global retail market and less than 4 per cent of the American one.

It looks a lot like the kind of listening tour a billionaire thinking of a future in politics might embark on. He denies any political ambition but don't bet against a change of heart: he has changed Facebook's share structure to keep control if he does run.</p><p>Follow Rhys Blakely on Twitter @rhysblakely</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-129894702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-4CC1-DY9P-N3VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 23, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

New regulations feel possible for the first time in decades.</p><p>The bosses who run the Valley feel a chill in the air. \"I mean, for most of the existence of the company this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,\" Mark Zuckerberg told Bloomberg this week. \"Something changed.\"</p><p>A good gauge of just how frosty Washington has become towards Big Tech will be the fate of a piece of legislation known as \"Section 230\". For two decades it has essentially shielded America's internet companies from being liable for the consequences of what their users post. It has been used as a defence by Backpage.com, a website widely recognised as a hub for child prostitution.</p><p>The stories are horrific. The site was linked, for instance, to a case of a 12-year-old girl in Atlanta whose pimp regularly tasered her and forced her to work while pregnant with his child. This week Congress heard from a mother whose daughter was murdered after being sold for sex on Backpage.com.</p><p>Advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is funded by Google, argue that ending Section 230 would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech. In part, Big Tech is arguing that editing their own websites would strain their bottom lines. This month Google started looking for a compromise with Congress on Section 230 - a U-turn that signals how the landscape is shifting.</p><p>PS Could a tech titan run for office? Mr Zuckerberg has been touring middle America. He has visited cattle farmers in South Dakota and car workers in Michigan. He has taken a photographer. It looks a lot like the kind of listening tour a billionaire thinking of a future in politics might embark on.

On July 29, the CEOs of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon, Apple, Google and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Facebook </emphasis>spent more than five hours answering difficult questions about their overwhelming market power from a bipartisan antitrust panel in the U.S. House of Representatives<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Nearing the End of an Era?</emphasis><br/>From Latin America's lost decade during the 1980s to the most recent Greek crisis, there are many painful reminders of what happens when countries cannot repay their debt. Today, a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">global debt crisis</emphasis> is likely to push millions of people into unemployment and fuel instability and violence around the world.</p><p><br/>In more ways than one, the COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be a great benefit for technology companies. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon's Jeff Bezos, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Apple's Tim Cook, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google's Sundar Pichai </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg </emphasis>all excel in their opening statements at the antitrust hearing, people value the services their companies provide.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> Recent research indicates that the COVID-19 crisis has intensified this assessment.<br/>It's not surprising. Digital technologies allow workers to carry out their work from home, for students to continue their classes while schools are closed, and for people to stay in touch with their loved ones and stay entertained while they stay sheltered where they are.<br/>Tech companies have reaped huge benefits from this change. In the first half of 2020, as the global economy faced an unprecedented recession, Amazon's share price rose by about 40%, driven by increased online shopping and increased use of cloud services. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zoom's market value has more than tripled since the start of the COVID-19 crisis,</emphasis>as it became a hub for remote meetings and online social activity.<br/>As far as Google and Facebook are concerned, they suffered temporary losses resulting from reduced advertising revenue. But they are still an overwhelming part of the digital advertising market: four-fifths in the UK, to name a few. In addition, while Google and Facebook are free to use, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that consumers effectively pay for their services indirectly through advertising revenue, at a rate of $656 per household per year, which bears witness to their market power.<br/>It's too early to say how much of people's lives will be handled online, or for how long. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> People may be afraid of Covid-19, but they also suffer from Zoom fatigue.</emphasis> However, it seems likely that labour and social models will experience some sustained changes, which will have far-reaching political implications.<br/>To begin with, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">closing the digital divide will be more urgent than ever.</emphasis> Of the many forms of inequality that the pandemic is exposing and exacerbating, inequality of access to the Internet and digital technologies is one of the most prominent.<br/>All services that have so improved life under social estrangement standards \u2013 from remote work to online shopping and streaming services \u2013 are available only to those who have access to a reasonably fast and reliable Internet connection and adequate <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hardware. </emphasis> Many of these people also receive health care and accessgovernment support, further highlighting the critical importance of universal access.<br/>In recent years, governments have increasingly recognized this imperative. For example, in 2018, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. Federal Communications Commission</emphasis> made closing the digital divide a high priority. And yet, about one in 20 people in the United States still doesn't have a high-speed internet connection. In rural areas, about a third of households are not connected. The figures are equally disturbing in the UK.<br/>Closing the gap will require a large-scale investment in digital infrastructure that includes broadband connectivity and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5G</emphasis> technology for mobile services. Both the US and UK governments are working to meet the first imperative, making low-return rural investments that cannot attract private capital. Advancing the second target may be more difficult due to political opposition to Chinese telecoms giant and 5G technology leader <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Huawei.</emphasis><br/>But Huawei may turn out to be the tip of the iceberg, because the current change in the network will lead to greater political and regulatory monitoring of the tech giants. On the one hand, regulators are likely to pressure <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">telecommunications </emphasis>companies to increase their investment, encouraging discussions about licensing obligations and pricing (how much companies should invest and how they will finance it). Past disputes can re-emerge over where costs should fall along the value chain, from physical network operators to streaming services.<br/>But, as the recent <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. antitrust hearing</emphasis>points out, the most controversial issue is likely to be the market power of digital enterprises. Even in today's highly polarized political environment, growing concern for large tech companies\u2014including the viability of small producers and the economy's dependence on access to the digital market\u2014is widely shared. And U.S. regulators have already expressed their own concern with investigations by both the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federal Trade Commission </emphasis>and the Department of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Justice.</emphasis><br/>The European Union is well ahead of the US in terms of regulation, taxes and restrictions on large technology firms. The European Commission has carried out multiple antitrust cases against these giants, as well as broader initiatives such as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">proposed Digital Services Act.</emphasis> Margrethe Vestager \u2013 formerly European Commissioner for Competition and now the European Commission's Executive Vice-President for a Europe Adapted to the Digital Age \u2013 has led the way on this front.<br/>In the UK, the CMA is working to implement the Furman Review, a government-commissioned report on competition in the digital market published in March 2019. The panel recommended subjecting strategically important companies to specific regulation that includes a code of conduct that is likely to include issues such as promoting their own services, changes in terms and conditions, and prior notification of all mergers.<br/>It remains to be seen how these attempts will unfold, especially in a U.S. heading for a highly controversial presidential election. But one thing is clear: even if they achieve significant short-term gains thanks to the accelerated change in the network, technology monopolizers can no longer avoid the harsh glare of political attention. Thewarning that the situation will change, as shown in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bible,</emphasis>may be written on the wall.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a9Project Syndicate Translation: Rom\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Azc\u00e1rate</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13819529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KF-YYP1-DY1R-B0J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It's hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After cries of \"WTF?\" rippled across the internet, Zuckerberg made a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17588116/mark-zuckerberg-clarifies-holocaust-denial-offensive\">clarifying statement</url> summing up the dilemma: \"Our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue - but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg was not the only tech titan to stumble between freedom of speech and truth. Tesla chief Elon Musk was forced to apologise (rather mealy-mouthed) about his \"pedo guy\" jibe at one of the Thai cave rescue divers who had criticised the Musk mini-sub sideshow.</p><p>And both followed the more serious secrets and lies behind last month's grand jury fraud indictment of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the former Silicon Valley unicorn, Theranos. Holmes' story had been sufficiently compelling to persuade Rupert Murdoch to invest US$125 million -- his largest ever non-media play -- but not compelling enough to convince him to block the exposure of the company's falsities by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> reporter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549478/bad-blood-by-john-carreyrou/9781524731656/\">John Carreyrou</url>.</p><p>These stories tell us that the skill set of understanding tech disruption -- and how to monetise it -- doesn't necessarily match understandings outside that skill set -- like the epistemology of truth.</p><p>Through the 20th century, journalists grappled with this question at a practical level. The solution, expressed in codes of ethics and professional practice, was to be absolutist about truth, while opinion contended freely. While media critics may claim this distinction is broken, it long justified media' social license in a democratic society. It was entrenched in the defamation defences of \"truth\" and \"fair comment\". </p><p>It's a distinction the big tech platforms seek to wilfully elude. To accept it would mean accepting that Facebook is a media company, rather than, say, a utility as neutral about what it delivers as Australia Post.</p><p>However, both government regulation and the advertising market is pushing Facebook to be a publisher: reviewing and moderating -- perhaps even editing -- content. If traditional media have to accept this responsibility under their social license (to say nothing of defamation) then why should social media be immune, particularly when they all compete on the same advertising model?</p><p>This week, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/cover-story/2018/07/truth-disrupted\">Harvard Business Review</url></emphasis> put the view of the big end of town: false news is hurting business. The authors said their study showed that: \"false news travelled farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in every category of information, sometimes by an order of magnitude, and false political news travelled farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than any other type.\"</p><p>And that's before fake video and audio becomes widespread.</p><p>False news, says the voice of business, has a real impact. It hurts share prices and damages sales. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HBR</emphasis> says: \"we have no solid estimates of how much damage misinformation has caused individual businesses. But the frequency of such events suggests that it is a real and growing problem.\"</p><p>But the cure may be worse than the disease. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/\">The Information's</url> Jessica Lessin says Facebook \"is arguably the world's most powerful utility, providing more than two billion people access to information and speech. That's roughly half the broadband internet population. You can't shut down people's access to such a large audience lightly.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, while the new tech titans were struggling with truth and freedom of expression, the old titan Rupert Murdoch was demonstrating how to better put the two together in managing his public image, with the release of photos of the 87-year-old at the beach at St Tropez on the arm of his fourth wife Jerry Hall.</p><p>Murdoch has been rarely seen since his apparent fall on son Lachlan's yacht in January. Yet his hands-off handling of his paper's reporting on his Theranos' investment showed that perhaps there's still something for him to teach the new kids on the block.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW0-3W51-JD6R-T1Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><timeReceived>12:37:08 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001027</classCode><className>LIBEL &amp;

The unprecedented hearing will feature chief executives Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.  The CEOs will testify remotely at the hearing, which comes less than 100 days before the US election.  Zuckerberg is to say that the internet giant would not have succeeded without US laws fostering competition, but that the rules of the internet now need updating.  \"Facebook is a proudly American company,\" Zuckerberg said in prepared remarks ahead of what will be a closely watched House Judiciary Committee hearing.  \"Our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation.\"  Bezos will paint online giant Amazon as an American \"success\" story, while accepting a need for scrutiny.  \"I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,\" Bezos said in prepared remarks posted online ahead of the hearing.

But the future of Facebook's relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland's capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices.</p><p>Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that go into effect next month across the European Union. They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information.</p><p>Whether the U.S. Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated this past week, or whether big tech companies determine it's too cumbersome to treat the 500 million people of the E.U. differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation.</p><p>\"As a first mover, that has now become a baseline,\" said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe \"is increasingly setting the norm.\"</p><p>And Europeans have embraced the role.</p><p>\"The E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,\" said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels.</p><p>At the centre of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4% of global revenue - which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion.</p><p>\"Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,\" Dixon said from her Dublin townhouse office. \"It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.\"</p><p>Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said \"malicious actors\" had used its search tools to match previously hacked e-mail addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users'names, \"likes\" and other personal information - in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of who happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry.</p><p>Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops.</p><p>In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica mishap.</p><p>And then there's Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland.</p><p>The U.S. was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers'most sensitive information.</p><p>However, Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and the intense, wellfunded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

But the future of Facebook's relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland's capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices.</p><p>Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that go into effect next month across the European Union. They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information.</p><p>Whether the U.S. Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated this past week, or whether big tech companies determine it's too cumbersome to treat the 500 million people of the E.U. differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation.</p><p>\"As a first mover, that has now become a baseline,\" said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe \"is increasingly setting the norm.\"</p><p>And Europeans have embraced the role.</p><p>\"The E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,\" said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels.</p><p>At the centre of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4% of global revenue - which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion.</p><p>\"Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,\" Dixon said from her Dublin townhouse office. \"It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.\"</p><p>Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said \"malicious actors\" had used its search tools to match previously hacked e-mail addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users'names, \"likes\" and other personal information - in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of who happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry.</p><p>Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops.</p><p>In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica mishap.</p><p>And then there's Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland.</p><p>The U.S. was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers'most sensitive information.</p><p>However, Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and the intense, wellfunded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

Run by left-wing self-possessed snowflakes, social media giants are indulging their worst autocratic impulses. And because they can, it is getting worse. 'Absolute power corrupts absolutely.' Having been one of the early targets of social media censorship on Facebook, YouTube et al, I have advocated for anti-trust action [1]against these bullying behemoths. </p><p>Pamela Geller: Why I Am Suing Facebook - Breitbart[2] The Urgent Case for Legislation against Social Media GiantsPamela Geller, American Thinker[3] AT&amp;#38;T has called for an 'Internet Bill of Rights' and argued that Facebook and Google should also be subjected to rules that would prevent unfair censorship on their platforms. AT&amp;#38;T, one of the largest telecommunications companies, called for Congress to enact an 'Internet Bill of Rights' which would subject Facebook, Google, and other content providers to rules that would prevent unfaircensorship on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast or AT&amp;#38;T as well as content providers such as Facebook and Google. AT&amp;#38;T CEO RandallStephenson wrote[4], 'Congressional action is needed to establish an 'Internet Bill of Rights' that applies to all internet companies and guarantees neutrality, transparency, openness, non-discrimination and privacy protection for all internet users.' Stephenson posted the ad in the New York Times, Washington Post, and other national news outlets on Wednesday. We must get behind this \u2014 all of us \u2014 and fast. Because what is happening is being engineered at the government level. A chief officer from a major American communications company went to the terror state of Pakistan to assure the Pakistani government that Facebook would adhere to the sharia. The commitment was given by Vice President of Facebook Joel Kaplan, who called on Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. 'Facebook has reiterated its commitment to keep the platform safe and promote values that are in congruence with its community standards.' Early last year, I wrote[5]: 'The US government has used anti-trust laws to break up monopolies. They ought to break up Facebook. Section 2 of the Sherman Act[6] highlights particular results deemed anticompetitive by nature and prohibits actions that 'shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.' Couldn't the same be applied to information? The United States government took down Standard Oil, Alcoa, Northern Securities, the American Tobacco Company and many others without nearly the power that Facebook has.' NRO has come to that same conclusion: Tech companies such as Google and Facebook are also utilities of sorts that provide essential services. They depend on the free use of public airwaves. Yet they are subject to little oversight; they simply make up their own rules as they go along. Antitrust laws prohibit one corporation from unfairly devouring its competition, capturing most of its market, and then price-gouging as it sees fit without fear of competition. Google has all but destroyed its search-engine competitors in the same manner that Facebook has driven out competing social media. Clearly Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, Jack Dorsey, and Jeff Bezos are contemporary 'robber barons.' So why are they not smeared, defamed, and reviled like the robber barons of yesteryear? Says NRO[7]: Why are huge tech companies seemingly exempt from the rules that older corporations must follow? First, their CEOs wisely cultivate the image of hipsters. The public sees them more as aging teenagers in T-shirts, turtlenecks, and flip-flops than as updated versions of J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, or other robber barons of the past. Second, the tech industry's hierarchy is politically progressive. In brilliant marketing fashion, the Internet, laptops, tablets, and smartphones have meshed with the hip youth culture of music, television, the movies, universities, and fashion. Think Woodstock rather than Wall Street. Corporate spokesmen at companies such as Twitter and YouTube brag about their social awareness, especially on issues such as radical environmentalism, identity politics, and feminism. Given that the regulatory deep state is mostly a liberal enterprise, the tech industry is seen as an ally of federal bureaucrats and regulators. Think more of Hollywood, the media, and universities than Exxon, General Motors, Koch Industries, and Philip Morris. The groovy t-shirt-turtleneck vibe may keep the great unwashed under their spell, but it's the shared political ideology with the left that keeps these corporate managers free from accountability. The WSJ writes that antitrust regulators have a narrow test: Does their size leave consumers worse off? Surmising that if that's the test, 'there isn't a clear case for going after big tech.' I disagree. The consumer is far worse off. If we are not free to speak and think in what is today's Gutenberg press, than we could not be worse off.#FreeCandace[8] Tech giants are run by uniformly leftwing corporate managers. We have, FOR YEARS, warned of coming totalitarianism, crushing our 1st amendment rights on these public forums. The internet was the work of DoD paid for by US taxpayers. Time for govt intervention. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/nnvxsjJpck\">https://t.co/nnvxsjJpck</url>[9] \u2014 Pamela Geller (@PamelaGeller) May 2, 2020[10]Candace Owens, a conservative commentator and online activist, claims she was suspended from Twitter following a tweet criticizing Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's (D) stay-at-home order and encouraging the state's citizens to violate the directive. Twitter flagged Owens's tweet for violating the site's policies, according to the news source Mediaite[11].Owens alerted several conservative colleagues of her suspended account following her critique of Whitmer. A spokeswoman for Twitter confirmed to The Hill that Owens's tweet violated the platform's COVID-19 misinformation policy, 'specifically around heightened-risk health claims.'She added that, according to the policy, Owens's tweet involved 'denial of government body recommendations to decrease an individual's likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 with the intent to influence users into acting contrary to recommended guidance.'The spokeswoman said the tweet would need to be deleted while Owens served a 'timeout' before her profile could be reinstated.The tweet, which has been removed, said, 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.' Owens shared a screenshot of her removed post with the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, with a comment that stated, 'Twitter has locked me out of my account but has decided to omit which of their policies I have violated,' adding that 'I stand by my statement about Governor Whitmer acting as a dictator.' Other conservative accounts chimed in, expressing their support for Owens, including political activist Chuck Woolery and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Have a tip we should know?

Introduction</p><p>Human trafficking is the largest manifestation of slavery today, generating billions of dollars each year in illegal proceeds. (1) When first confronted with stories from the news or facts about human trafficking, it seems like there is no way that it could be true. (2) How is it possible that women and children are being bought and sold online without a trace? (3) Nevertheless, the reality is that human trafficking, and more specifically sex trafficking, is happening at rates that both the government and the public cannot keep up with. (4)</p><p>Human trafficking is a hidden crime. (5) It often includes forced labor, domestic servitude, forced marriages, and most commonly, commercial sex. (6) Globally, the most common form of human trafficking is sex trafficking. (7) Sex trafficking encompasses activities related to prostitution, commercial sexual activities, sex tourism, and pornography. (8) it undermines core human rights, as well as destroys and threatens the safety of communities. (9) With the aid of new technologies, women and children are being bought and sold online without a trace. (10) Today, these new technologies continue to outpace the law, taking human trafficking into the deepest corners of the internet, undetectable by law enforcement. (11)</p><p>In 2000, Congress discovered that 700,000 persons annually, primarily women and children, were being trafficked within or across international borders. (12) in 2018, it was estimated that over 100,000 human trafficking victims had been identified globally, thousands of which came in and out of the united states. (13) With the rise of the internet, the market for sex trafficking went global, with the internet becoming the mecca. (14) specifically, many victims meet their traffickers over the internet by being coerced with promises of a better life. (15) Nevertheless, the relationship will quickly turn toxic with the trafficker becoming controlling and abusive. (16) In 2016, the National center for Missing and Exploited children reported an 846% increase from 2010 to 2015 in reports of suspected child trafficking. (17) This increase was found to be directly correlated to the increase in the use of the internet in selling children for sex. (18)</p><p>The advancement of technology is fueling sex trafficking, and legislation is not moving fast enough. (19) In 2017, Congress passed the Allow states and Victims to Fight online sex Trafficking Act (\"FOSTA\"). (20) This Act was passed with the purpose of amending the Communications Decency Act of 1934, and no longer granting immunity to internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), whose websites \"knowingly\" publish illegal sex trafficking content. (21) in hindsight, FosTA is a progressive enactment to help stop online sex trafficking, but this Act has unintended consequences. (22) For instance, instead of promoting companies to better ensure there is no illegal sex trafficking content being published on their websites, these companies are instead taking necessary steps to avoid liability for \"knowingly\" facilitating online sex trafficking. (23) Therefore, Congress needs to keep working to not only put in place the proper preventative measures, but to also catch up or get ahead in the technological race that is currently being won by sex traffickers.</p><p>II. History</p><p>A. The Rise of Technology in Sex Trafficking</p><p>Before the internet became mainstream, newsgroups and newspapers were the main media outlet for sex trafficking advertisements. (24) However, with the rise of technology and the internet, there has been a radical transformation in the landscape of sex trafficking. (25) With the use of the internet, sex trafficking can be conducted online. (26) By the mid 1990s, women and children were being marketed worldwide. (27) in 1994, the first prostitution website was launched. (28) This website enabled perpetrators to market women for services around the world. (29) Shortly after the establishment of prostitution websites, the \"World Sex Guide\" launched online. (30) Here, men from around the world could leave reviews on women based on how easily they were able to coerce them in to \"painful, risky, or humiliating\" sex acts. (31) This later led to the creation of video chatting where with a little less than the click of a mouse, perpetrators had access to victims. (32)</p><p>The urgency to end sex trafficking came to the world's attention in 1999, due to the establishment of online rape camps. (33) These rape camps were live video chats, where viewers were given the capability to request acts of sexual assault and torture that were then carried out on the victim. (34) With new video chat technology, perpetrators were able to record and re-watch the once live sex shows. (35) This technology allowed video recordings to be used on websites as a way for traffickers to market women and children. (36) These new technological capabilities captured the attention of the legislature and compelled them to act. (37)</p><p>B. The Communications Decency Act of 1996</p><p>In 1996, the Communications Decency Act (\"CDA\") was enacted by Congress as a way to regulate the distribution of obscene or indecent material on the internet. (38) The Act states that \"no provider or user of an [ISP] shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" (39) Further, Section 230 of the CDA protects websites based on a \"good faith\" effort to report or block material that the provider considers to be \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\" (40) Essentially, Section 230 of the CDA is providing broad immunity to ISPs. (41) Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit held that if a website plays any part in editing content to make it more acceptable for posting purposes, then they can risk losing their immunity under the CDA. (42) With Section 230 of the CDA in play, the courts have struggled to assign liability to those truly responsible for the buying and selling of sex online. (43)</p><p>C. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000</p><p>In 2000, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (\"TVPA of 2000\") was enacted by Congress. (44) This Act served as the first federal law to protect victims and prosecute traffickers. (45) Moreover, along with this bill came the Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking. (46) The Task Force was established with three objectives: (1) to collect data and research on domestic and international trafficking; (2) to evaluate the progress that the United States and other countries were taking to prevent, protect, and prosecute human trafficking; and (3) to cooperate with other nations as an effort to end trafficking globally. (47)</p><p>The TVPA of 2000 was not only meant to help combat human trafficking, but to also give aid to women who were prone to becoming victims of sex trafficking. (48) The TVPA of 2000 accomplished this goal through establishing various prevention programs with the objective of deterring prostitution. (49) Further, the Bill established the \"T Visa,\" which allowed non-residents who were victims of sex trafficking to become temporary residents of the United States, and be eligible for the Witness Protection Program. (50) Additionally, the TVPA of 2000 made all forms of human trafficking a federal crime. (51) Not only did the United States seek to end trafficking, but they sought to aid and support those who had been victimized by such acts. (52)</p><p>D. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003</p><p>In 2003, the Bush Administration enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (\"TVPRA of 2003\") to further combat human trafficking. (53) This reauthorization added to the TVPA of 2000 by authorizing over $200 million to combat human trafficking and renewing the United States' commitment to ending human trafficking. (54) The TVPRA of 2003 gave victims even more access to aid, and allowed them to bring civil suits against traffickers in order to recover punitive damages. (55)</p><p>E. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2013</p><p>By 2012, President Barack obama stated that human trafficking was \"the most pressing human rights issue of our time.\" (56) This stark realization warranted the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2013 (\"TVPRA of 2013\"). (57) Different from the previous Victim Protection Acts, this Act focused on the rapid growth of technology and how it affected human trafficking. (58) The goal behind the 2013 Reauthorization was to initiate the use of technology to combat trafficking online. (59) Law enforcement would use electronic surveillance, and data from cellphones or computers to monitor and find suspected perpetrators involved in human trafficking. (60)</p><p>Additionally, soon after the passing of the 2013 Reauthorization Act, ISP tech companies in the private sector got involved in the fight against human trafficking. (61) ISP tech companies were forming company-wide initiatives to detect traffickers and supply victims with resources to get help. (62) Nonetheless, ISPs operate as neutral forum websites where users can post their own content to the site. (63) Though some websites are enacting protocols to stop trafficking, other websites are enabling buyers and sellers of sex to maintain their anonymity, while remaining free of legal consequences. (64)</p><p>F. The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act</p><p>On March 21, 2018, Congress passed into law the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (\"FOSTA\"). (65) This Act clarified that the CDA \"was never intended to provide legal protection to websites that unlawfully promote and facilitate prostitution and websites that facilitate traffickers in the sale of unlawful sex.\" (66) The FOSTA states that to \"participate\" means to \"knowingly assist, support, or facilitate\" sex trafficking. (67) With the passing of the FOSTA, ISPS could no longer escape civil and criminal liability relating to the exploitation of children or sex trafficking. (68)</p><p>G. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2018</p><p>In an effort to further combat human trafficking, on January 8, 2019, President Trump signed the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018 (\"TVPRA of 2018\"). (69) This Act reauthorized existing efforts that have been in place since the Act's creation in 2000, as well as launched new initiatives. (70) This legislation seeks to accomplish three major goals: (1) stronger law enforcement; (2) government and corporate accountability; and (3) prevention efforts. (71) Specifically, this Act will give prosecutors the crucial resources necessary to efficiently and effectively prosecute human trafficking related crimes. (72) The law will also develop victim screening protocols as well as foster coordination between federal, state and local law enforcement in order to bring multi-jurisdictional cases. (73) Further, corporate and governmental entities will now be held accountable for being involved, either directly or indirectly, for participating in activities that support human trafficking. (74) Together, the government and corporations can work to ensure that business coming in, or occurring in the United States, is not a product of human trafficking. (75) Finally, this Act implements funding for educational programs that teach children the signs of human trafficking. (76) These educational efforts provide a way to prevent human trafficking before it starts as opposed to merely reacting. (77) These three major incentives will function to detect human trafficking in both the United States and abroad. (78)</p><p>III. Facts</p><p>The United States has made continuous efforts to pass evolving legislation that combats the growth of human trafficking, namely sex trafficking. (79) While the executive branch acknowledges the grave threat that trafficking poses on human rights, the judiciary struggles on where to assign the blame. (80) Nonetheless, the legislature continues to try to franticly pass laws that will stop crimes online without violating constitutional rights. (81) Much of the human trafficking legislation passed through Congress has focused on the resources provided for victims, but has failed to put significant preventative measures in place. (82) Simply put, new legislation is not accounting for the technological advancements of society. (83)</p><p>A. Technology is Outpacing the Law</p><p>Technology is outpacing the law, and traffickers are using this to their advantage. (84) Many traffickers use technology to recruit, control, and exploit victims. (85) With the use of technology, traffickers are able to meet, keep, and sell their victims. (86) Typically, ISP websites are a main source for human trafficking. (87) Traffickers post illegal advertisements for commercial sex with links connecting buyers and sellers to various goods. (88) Further, these practices of selling children have remained hidden online, and gone undetected by law enforcement. (89) in the era of technology, traffickers continue to find loopholes that allow them remain undercover. (90)</p><p>Nevertheless, iSP websites were exploited to the public during the Backpage.com (\"Backpage\") investigation. (91) Backpage, an ISP website, became the primary location for the sale of sex online. (92) On Backpage, traffickers would routinely post ads in the adult section of the site. (93) Here, traffickers were able to conduct their illegal activities, while Backpage would profit. (94) Though Backpage was created in 2004, it was able to remain undetected in its part in editing advertisements until 2016. (95) During their investigation, the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations concluded that Backpage had introduced an \"ad hoc\" policy, where moderators would manually remove words, phrases, or images that indicated any illegal transactions before publishing ads to their site. (96) This policy allowed Backpage to hide the illegality of the advertisements, while maintaining the purpose--a commercial sex transaction. (97) Although there were protections for victims of sex trafficking through the prior Acts, ISPs, such as Backpage, were able to escape responsibility for sex trafficking under the CDA. (98)</p><p>B. Legislation is Reacting, but Not Doing</p><p>The FOSTA is at odds with the CDA and the protection it provides to ISP websites. (99) The final draft of the FOSTA left technology companies unclear on what would constitute as \"knowing facilitation.\" (100) When the FOSTA was in the beginning stages of legislation, tech companies such as Google, who pride themselves on being allies against sex-trafficking, supported the new law. (101) However, the unclear language of the bill raised concerns that the \"Good Samaritan\" rules would no longer apply, thus actually crippling the fight against sex trafficking. (102) For example, if a tech company would be held liable for \"knowing\" of sex trafficking on their site, even though trying to remove it, they may simply stop looking for it as a means to shield themselves from liability. (103)</p><p>Those who argue against the bill suggest that it should have been written more comprehensively. (104) Critics argue that the bill should have included other forms of illegal activity, as well as be able to grant immunity to sites that can show they reasonably responded to unlawful activity on their site. (105) While big tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, can handle the finances of a lawsuit under this new legislation, they have banded together with small ISP tech companies in advocating against the FOSTA. (106)</p><p>Alternatively, tech companies could be partly to blame for the necessity of the FOSTA because of industry-wide inattentiveness. (107) For some brief amount of time it is possible that websites, such as Backpage, were unaware of child sex trafficking occurring on their site. (108) Undoubtedly, because of the magnitude of illegal activity taking place on their site, it became clear that Backpage was knowingly facilitating sex trafficking. (109) With this, ISP websites should bear some liability for not monitoring their site closely enough to recognize illegal activity taking place. (110)</p><p>C. The Risks of Censoring Internet Service Provider Websites</p><p>Advocates for free speech have cautioned that censoring ISPs could put sex trafficking victims in danger. (111) A number of free speech organizations raised concerns about the regulation of speech for consensual sex online. (112) However, these arguments go head-to-head with a number of Supreme Court decisions on illegal speech. (113) The Supreme Court has issued decisions that specifically relate to child pornography and the protection of children from sexual abuse. (114) But, in order for the government to restrict a constitutionally granted right, there must be a compelling governmental interest. (115) It is clear that the government's interest in protecting children from sexual abuse substantially outweighs some forms of free speech online. (116) The government's desire to protect these children thwarts tech companies' arguments that censoring their online activities would be a violation of free speech. (117)</p><p>IV. Analysis</p><p>A. The FOSTA Needs to be Updated</p><p>The FOSTA is the most significant piece of internet legislation in the last two decades. (118) Nevertheless, its use of ambiguous language is having devastating consequences. (119) The language of the FOSTA calls for civil or criminal liability against sites that \"knowingly\" allow sex trafficking to occur on their websites, which is practically forcing sites to turn a blind eye to illegal activity on their sites. (120) In hindsight, the FOSTA is a major step in the right direction, but at a second glance, the new legislation has the ability to lead to a larger human trafficking crisis. (121)</p><p>Before the FOSTA, tech companies could put forth a \"good-faith\" effort by working with law enforcement to combat sex trafficking online. (122) However, this new legislation demands that every byte of content is monitored with small margin for error. (123) Thus, countless lawsuits are being filed for failure to get illegal content off of a website. (124) Big tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, or Facebook, have the resources to monitor content and defend themselves against litigation. (125) However, smaller tech companies do not have the same capabilities. (126) This has led to small tech companies no longer seeking out illegal activity on their sites. (127) Instead of the FOSTA putting an end to online sex trafficking, it has put the full responsibility of finding and stopping illegal content on the internet onto ISPs. (128) The FOSTA has placed immense pressure on tech companies, and may not actually end online sex trafficking. (129)</p><p>Further, the FOSTA remains unclear through its ambiguous language on the expectations that are now in place for iSP websites. (130) Alternatively, if this new legislation is meant to incentivize tech companies to vigilantly find and stop the illegal activity on their sites, then sex trafficking is just one of the countless number of crimes ISPs could potentially be liable for reporting. (131) This could leave Facebook on the hook for drug transactions that are initiated through a status update. (132) It could also lead Google to censor content for legal activity in one state that is a crime in another state. (133) The law remains unclear about whether or not sex trafficking is the only crime sites should be looking for. (134)</p><p>With this in mind, one thing remains clear after considering opinions on the FOSTA. (135) The passing of the FOSTA is long overdue as it pertains to ending sex trafficking online, especially for children. (136) But, there needs to be a much brighter line drawn for ISP websites that identify what \"knowingly facilitating\" illegal activity on their sites means. (137) The legislation needs to specifically state what activities ISP websites need to be looking for. (138) Clarity is essential for law enforcement to comprehend the circumstances surrounding the illegal activity found on a given website. (139) Furthermore, in order for the judiciary to achieve justice, the rules must be clear so they can investigate and determine if the site was in fact \"knowingly facilitating\" illegal activity. (140)</p><p>B. The Significance of the TVPA of 2018</p><p>While disputes continue about the FOSTA, the signing of the TVPA of 2018 has been well received. (141) President Trump stands firm on his commitment to ending sex trafficking, and has made it clear that the United States will not tolerate human trafficking, including sex trafficking. (142) Throughout history, legislation has merely reacted to sex trafficking. (143) Though the United States has implemented programs to help the victims of trafficking, as well as give funding to initiatives to combat trafficking, the crime continues to increase. (144) The rehabilitation of victims is imperative, but it is more imperative that sex trafficking be stopped before it even starts. (145)</p><p>Fortunately, the signing of the TVPA of 2018 implements major resources for prosecutors so they can efficiently investigate and effectively prosecute traffickers. (146) This new legislation pours resources into educating every person, including children, to the signs of sex trafficking. (147) Educating children about the signs of sex trafficking, especially online, has yet to be seen in prior legislation, and not knowing what to be aware of put children at a heightened risk of being trafficked. (148) Further, trafficked victims are normally people who are already at risk, thus educating people on the signs of sex trafficking is critical. (149) These crucial steps taken are imperative if the United States is going to stay ahead of sex trafficking, instead of continuing to be outpaced by technology.</p><p>C. The Needfor Collaboration Between Tech Companies and the Government</p><p>Sex trafficking is a global problem that is going to require the collaboration of technology companies and the government if they want to be successful at ending it. (150) Perpetrators of sex trafficking have become experts in social media, fake profiles, and the hidden sex markets of the internet. (151) They use technology to their advantage to outsmart and remain hidden from law enforcement. (152) Nevertheless, with the help of tech companies, law enforcement may be able to more easily detect and remove perpetrators from online. (153) While tech companies right now may just be avoiding liability, they can do so much more than that. (154) They can work with law enforcement to understand how technology is used to traffic, and then provide viable solutions. (155) Sex trafficking cannot be stopped without the help and effort of everyone involved--whether by choice or not. (156) Further, with sex trafficking taking on such a technology based platform, it is quickly pushing its way to the headlines of the news, and Americans are becoming acutely aware of the growing dangers that sex trafficking poses. (157) Now, all eyes are on both tech companies and the government to see how these two forces will work to end sex trafficking. (158) The solutions are there, but it will take the collaboration from everyone to find and execute them. (159)</p><p>V. Conclusion</p><p>Sex trafficking is happening in every neighborhood, every city and every country around the world, and the internet is only accelerating the market. The advancement of technology has allowed traffickers to take their business to the darkest corners of the internet and remain largely undetectable. Though past legislation has missed the mark or caused push-back, it was still progress. Nevertheless, the newest Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act signed by President Trump is paving the way for tackling sex trafficking head on. As sex trafficking emerges from the hidden corners of the internet, it is imperative that the United States stays on the cutting edge of the fight against sex trafficking.</p><p>Kirsten M.

Id.</p><p>(131) See Rosenbaum, supra note 48 (disagreeing with how lawmakers are viewing the actual threat of sex trafficking).

In Tampa alone, 10,000 phone numbers were identified and mass texts were sent to these numbers with a phone number and website offering help and ways to get out of the industry. Id. Buyers were also informed of the consequences of buying sex. Id. See Accelerating the use of tech, supra note 19 (setting forth that technology can be used to disrupt human trafficking). \"While online platforms have become low cost hotspots for remote victim recruitment through advertisements, social media, and job sites, innovative tech tools can help to empower, educate, and protect potential victims, youth, and workers.\" Id.</p><p>(156) See Technology and Trafficking, supra note 81 (\"It is imperative that all stakeholders - including governments, the UN, tech companies, CSOs, and survivors - are at the table and come together to develop stronger and coordinated legal, policy and technological solutions.\").</p><p>(157) See Rogers, supra note 5 (noting that with Robert Kraft's charges for prostitution, many Americans are \"becoming aware for the first time of the dark underworld of sex trafficking in this country\").</p><p>(158) See id.

It's one of the many technology giants, including Amazon.com and Alphabet's Google, demanding cheaper - and cleaner - electricity as their data demands grow. This hunger for power has set Silicon Valley on a collision course with the Trump administration, which is working up a plan to keep coal plants afloat by raising electricity prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a rare source of demand growth, these tech firms have become formidable advocates for clean energy. They have contracted enough renewable energy to displace at least 12 coal generators, and some are paying millions to sever ties with utilities to find their own supply.</p><p>Big Tech is no longer \"afraid to throw around their weight or their ability to influence - some might say bully - their local utility or local governments in what they want to get,\" said Lucas Beran, a senior research analyst on IHS Markit's data centre and cloud team.</p><p>It's easy to see why the companies have become such advocates. Power used by all the nation's data centres is set to climb 4 per cent from 2014 to 2020, according to an Energy Department report.</p><p>Server farms now draw enough electricity to light up Las Vegas and the rest of Nevada, twice over. Etsy alone used 10,679 megawatt-hours last year, enough to supply 1,000 homes.</p><p>While coal still accounts for about a third of U.S. electricity, it is losing ground to cheaper natural gas, wind and solar.</p><p>Hundreds of mines have shut in recent years and U.S. President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to revive them. His administration is now calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to enact a plan that would subsidize coal-fired power plants.</p><p>In a letter last month, Etsy called on regulators to reject Trump's plan, which it described as a barrier to \"making creative entrepreneurship a path to economic security.\"</p><p>Separately, a group that includes Amazon and Microsoft Corp. said the administration is overlooking the potential of renewable power, grid technology and energy storage, warning that the proposal would create \"burdensome out-of-market costs on consumers like our companies.\"</p><p>Their push for clean power extends well beyond Washington.</p><p>Alphabet has called on utilities to create \"buy-as-you-go\" renewable energy programs. The demands of modern electricity consumers have outgrown the standard utility business model designed \"for a bygone era,\" it said in a white paper last year.</p><p>The company, based in Mountain View, Calif., runs the world's largest online search engine. It has signed contracts to buy 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy that it said will lead to $3.5 billion of investments.</p><p>The fight to transform power supplies is just the latest instance of technology companies flexing their political muscle and green image. Earlier this year, the industry opposed Trump's decision to remove the U.S. from the international Paris climate accord. Many, including Google, Microsoft and Facebook pledged to continue the battle against global warming.</p><p>Meanwhile, building solar and wind farms is now less expensive than keeping coal generators online in parts of the U.S., and solar power is set to become the world's cheapest source of electricity. Renewables account for about 15 per cent of the U.S. power mix, compared with almost nothing two decades ago.</p><p>Utilities aren't opposed to investing in renewable power. But technology companies are demanding supplies in quantities that could disrupt the reliability of transmission systems, said Matt Mooren, an energy analyst with PA Consulting Group.</p><p>Electricity is notoriously hard to store, so for the most part, it must be used instantaneously. Solar and wind farms don't work when the sun isn't shining and wind isn't blowing. That creates a juggling act for utilities that must maintain a steady flow of power to customers.</p><p>Industry consultant Lazard estimates a grid can handle about 30 per cent of its power coming from renewables. Beyond that, utilities need backup systems such as batteries or conventional power plants.</p><p>Even so, the technology industry won't let up on its demands, said Mark Mills, a senior fellow at the free-market think tank Manhattan Institute who authored the 2013 study \"The Cloud Begins With Coal.\"</p><p>Switch Inc., a Las Vegas data-centre provider, agreed to pay $27 million last year to leave its Nevada utility in a bet that the company could find cheaper renewable energy elsewhere. Microsoft paid almost $24 million to bypass a Washington utility and find power on its own.</p><p>In West Virginia, the heart of America's Coal Country, potter Joy Bridy makes everything from mugs to sauerkraut crocks that she sells on Etsy. Her operation is powered by solar panels that Etsy helped her get.</p><p>Despite her state's deep roots in coal, she backs the company's fight for more renewable energy.</p><p>\"That's the way the ball's rolling,\" Bridy said. \"The sooner we all get with the program, the better it will be.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2017120244349433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R36-WY61-DY91-K53N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 2, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000A63L</classCode><className>ETSY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ETSY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

For lobbying firms there is a rush to snap up potentially lucrative contracts, but also pressure to deliver as the tech industry faces one of its toughest battles.</p><p>\"Antitrust investigations are fact-intensive by their nature and these are complicated, fast-moving markets. It's no surprise that the big tech companies are staffing up with people to help answer inquiries from antitrust enforcers,\" said Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p><p>Tech companies are no strangers to K Street and have been boosting their lobbying spending in recent years, attracting some of the top talent in Washington. Tech companies have faced a host of legislative and regulatory questions in recent years, including over data privacy scandals, workforce diversity, encryption, net neutrality and trade. But for Silicon Valley, the prospect of federal regulators looking into their market power could shake up their business models and drastically change their companies.</p><p>Both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) are weighing probes into the industry's biggest players, and Congress has opened its own investigation into whether to rewrite the nation's antitrust laws for the new economy.</p><p>The increased scrutiny also comes with the industry finding few allies in Washington.</p><p>Critics, including President Trump and 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have even floated breaking up the companies to level the playing field.</p><p>Enlisting help from the influence world will be critical to helping fight off that threat, K Street watchers told The Hill.</p><p>\"Washington likes to control anything that's important, and today that includes online platforms,\" Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at NetChoice, a trade association of e-commerce businesses, said.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley has woken up to this reality and is hiring accordingly. This is the normal path of any business as it grows.\"</p><p>The antitrust fight could be a gold mine for lobbying firms as tech companies beef up their Washington presence. But there are also high stakes for those firms and executives at trade associations, who must now deliver and help the industry fight off the threat.</p><p>That pressure is being highlighted by Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., which is undertaking a major overhaul of its government affairs operation. The company has fired outside firms, shaken up its policy team and seen the departure of two senior officials in Washington as it rethinks its lobbying efforts, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.</p><p>Google spent more than $21.7 million on lobbying expenditures in 2018. So far in 2019, it has spent $3.5 million amid the reshuffle. The six outside firms Google dropped accounted for $20 million of its annual lobbying bill, according to the Journal.</p><p>Like Google, other tech companies have also been throwing large sums at K Street.</p><p>Amazon has spent more than Google so far this year, with just under $4 million on lobbying. That figure puts it on pace to surpass the $14.4 million it spent on lobbying in 2018.</p><p>Amazon's ramped-up K Street operation comes as it also makes plans to place its second headquarters in the Washington, D.C., area. The company has increased its lobbying expenditures every year since 2008, when it spent $1.3 million on lobbying.</p><p>McGuireWoods LLP is its top law and lobbying firm, receiving $90,000 from the online retailer so far this year. Its second top lobbying firm is Ballard Partners, which is the firm of Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for Trump.</p><p>Facebook is third among the industry's four giants this year, with $3.4 million spent on lobbying expenditures so far in 2019 and on target to at least match the $12.6 million spent for 2018. Lobbying and law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson has a $130,000 contract with the company.</p><p>Of the big four tech players, Apple has the smallest lobbying footprint. It has spent more than $1.9 million on lobbying so far in 2019 and has four firms on retainer. In 2018, it spent more than $6.6 million, down from the more than $7.1 million spent in 2017.</p><p>The companies have also snapped up a number of prominent lobbyists, including at Facebook, which hired Catlin O'Neill, who was chief of staff to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) before leaving in 2013.</p><p>The tech industry's lobbying forces will have to move quickly.</p><p>According to reports, the DOJ and FTC have reportedly reached an agreement on how to divide up oversight, with the DOJ focusing on Apple and Google and the FTC setting its sights on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>And on Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee held the first hearing in its antitrust probe, hearing from publishers who say that companies like Google and Facebook have cornered the market in digital ads.</p><p>\"It is incumbent on Congress to understand the sources of this problem and address it urgently,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). \"Congress also has a constitutional duty to ensure markets are structured in a way that is compatible with our democratic values.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

At a Hawaiianthemed party in Davos hosted by his $134bn software company Salesforce, cocktails were being served as the Black Eyed Peas cranked out a set.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Outside, the snow lay thick on the ground but inside a nightclub in the Swiss ski resort Gavin Patterson, then chief executive of BT, was rubbing shoulders with Sergey Brin, Google co-founder and Lloyd Blankfein, then Goldman Sachs boss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Mr Patterson, however, the fun at the World Economic Forum (WEF) didn't last long.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just four days later, BT's market value plunged by \u00a38bn as investors digested news of a massive accounting scandal at its Italian division.</p><p>It was the beginning of a bubbling crisis at the UK telecom giant which ended in Mr Patterson's departure less than 18 months later, after investors made it clear they had lost confidence in his ability to lead BT through an ambitious overhaul.</p><p>This week, however, Patterson, 51, is back in the spotlight after it emerged Mr Benioff had picked him as Salesforce's new chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).</p><p>The appointment of a former FTSE 100 boss is a bold statement of intent from Salesforce, which is banking on a big expansion in the UK and Europe as a key plank of its growth strategy. The company, which occupies the upper floors of what is now called the Salesforce (n\u00e9e Heron) Tower on Bishopsgate in the City - Britain's third-tallest building - already employs more than 1,200 people in the UK and last year pledged to almost double that figure as it spends $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) in Britain over the next five years. Despite the political crisis surrounding Brexit, most of Silicon Valley's tech giants are bulking up in Britain, drawn in by London's growing tech sector and a need to expand globally. But few are making appointments as high profile as Salesforce.</p><p>Patterson's appointment comes just weeks after the company said Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who ran Virgin Money for more than a decade, would become its UK chief executive. The company already counts former European competition and digital commissioner Neelie Kroes as a board member.</p><p>These are not ordinary regional hires, even for a company of Salesforce's size. But in the UK at least, they will bring credibility to a company that many still struggle to understand.</p><p>Founded by Benioff, whose fortune is estimated at $6.4bn, Salesforce may be the biggest and most powerful tech company you have never heard of.</p><p>It specialises in \"customer relationship management\" (CRM) software, used by businesses to keep track of and contact customers and potential clients. Its cloud-based software is used to store details, log communication and respond to questions or complaints. If you have filled in a website form or called a customer service hotline, there is a good chance the person on the other end was using Salesforce software.</p><p>If that sounds dull, Benioff - a consummate showman - has proved adept at building Salesforce into a successful business, roping in thousands of customers - large and small - into its orbit and generating spectacular growth in sales.</p><p>Much of that has been through Benioff 's genius for creating a spectacle - often with himself as a star attraction - and his fondness for spending big bucks doing so.</p><p>Back home in San Francisco, the company's annual Dreamforce event - a sort of software marketing circus meets music festival mash-up - has grown to legendary status, attracting nearly 200,000 people last year.</p><p>It featured Al Gore giving a speech on climate change and a group of Buddhist monks lecturing delegates on meditation and mindfulness. The contemplative atmosphere was later shattered by a set from Metallica.</p><p>In true tech mogul fashion, Benioff is also fond of big buildings. San Francisco's Salesforce Tower, the software giant's headquarters, is America's tallest office west of Chicago. It has a naming rights deal with the city's transport centre. And other Salesforce Towers can be found in Tokyo, New York and - soon - Dublin.</p><p>In 2014, the City of London Corporation denied a bid to rename the 46-storey Heron Tower, but later relented. It's a building Patterson is likely to be spending plenty of time in.</p><p>Salesforce's co-chief executives, Marc Benioff and Keith Block, said the former BT boss has \"extensive experience in digital communications, customer engagement and systems delivery\" and will be \"a powerful addition to our EMEA team\".</p><p>Salesforce did not invent CRM, but was a pioneer in selling its software as a subscription, allowing businesses to access it over the internet rather than installing it on their own servers.</p><p>It was a radical idea back in 2000, but cloud software is now common. Workers are on their phone as much as their desktop and need access to information anywhere. As a result, the industry is growing rapidly: Salesforce's revenues grew 22pc to $4bn in the second quarter of this year. But in its home market, growth is slowing.</p><p>In the Americas - which accounts for the bulk of Salesforce's revenues - growth was 20pc compared with 30pc for EMEA once foreign exchange fluctuations were stripped out.</p><p>\"CRM is not a new category and the North American market is pretty saturated,\" says Mary Shea, an analyst at Forrester. \"Companies of a certain size are going to have Salesforce or [Microsoft's rival software] Dynamics. Europe is the next opportunity for new customers.\"</p><p>But if the cloud means that business is just as easily done from the beach as the office, why is Salesforce relying on the rather old school business tactic of hiring big hitters - and their contact books - to expand in Europe? Patterson, in particular, has been hired partly to sign up multinational European companies, something Benioff will hope the ex-BT boss can carry over from the telecoms group's Global Services arm, which manages IT networks for large companies.</p><p>The division may not have been as cutting edge as Salesforce, but that may prove to be an advantage in Europe, where companies have been slower to embrace cloud technology and a lot of business is still done face to face.</p><p>Tech adoption in Europe lags fairly significantly,\" says Shea. \"The local presence is important for a number of reasons, how you sell in North America versus Europe is very different. You can't sell everything over the phone.\"</p><p>Hiring from outside the tech industry may suit Benioff, who has been happy to distance himself from the rest of Silicon Valley. During a panel at last year's World Economic Forum, he attacked Google and Uber, despite executives from both companies sitting close to him, and called for more regulation of Big Tech. He has compared Facebook to the cigarette industry, suggesting the world will regret not curbing it sooner.</p><p>But in one way at least, Salesforce may not be so different to some of its Californian neighbours. In recent years it has lost money as often as it has turned a profit, and its soaring share price has instead been based on growing revenues, says IDC analyst Jordan Jewell. \"They're keeping this cycle going and they can't slow down,\" he says, pointing out that the company spends around half of its revenues on sales and marketing alone.</p><p>As its home market slows down, an experienced salesman like Patterson will be crucial to growing Salesforce into a global phenomenon.</p><p>'The local presence is important for a number of reasons. You can't sell everything over the phone'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Gavin Patterson, the former BT chief, has joined Marc Benioff, right, at SalesforceSalesforce isn't a household name, but its founder has a fondness for creating a spectacle and the company holds an annual Dreamforce event which last year featured Metallica</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-152663065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X09-9HG1-DYTY-C1KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1234\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0006Q3X</classCode><className>VIRGIN MONEY PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thirty-eight percent of all the unicorns in Europe are in the UK, and 30pc of the 'futurecorns' [companies with potential to exceed $1bn in valuation] worth $50m to $800m are here.\" </p><p>\"So not only is the UK light years ahead of the rest of Europe and Israel, across every dimension, even in the last five years its lead has just been accelerating.\"</p><p>Klein, whose father Robin is also a venture capitalist and a venture partner at Index Ventures, continues: \"So the real comparison is regional cities in the UK compared to capital cities in Europe. Right? So Oxbridge has nine, Berlin has 10. Manchester has five. Amsterdam has six.\"</p><p>According to KPMG, London <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/19/five-steps-boris-can-take-right-now-boost-britains-tech-sector/\">ranks third in the world as a technology innovation hub</url> while the UK as a whole ranks fourth behind only the US, China and India.</p><p>Britain's fertile tech scene represents a huge contrast to 17 years ago, when Klein returned to Britain from a spell living in Boston and Seattle, where he experienced the first dotcom investment boom - and its subsequent bust in 2000-01 - first hand.</p><p>\"When I came back to the UK in 2002, there wasn't much of an ecosystem to speak of - or at least it was very, very nascent,\" he says.</p><p>\"Most people were kind of dancing on the grave of the internet, like 'stupid kids - we knew they were full of shit. Thank god they're gone'.\"</p><p>A Cambridge University graduate - who studied English Literature not Computer Science - Klein has arguably surfed the wave of Britain's technology boom more successfully than anyone else.</p><p>His first big success came after an early investment in Skype, the video chat service, which was sold to Ebay for $4.2bn in 2005.</p><p>\"That also made me realise that you could build a global winner from the UK and Europe. </p><p>\"Because Skype was was global. You could build a company that someone else put an extraordinary value on - $4.2bn which even in today's money is a very decent exits, but in 2005, it was really big.\"</p><p>He says it was the alumni from Skype as well as Lovefilm and a string of other early London-based startup success stories who have gone on to found a new generation of companies and have fuelled the industry's growth.</p><p>As in Silicon Valley, the UK now has a significant pool of talent to draw from with experience of building tech start-ups, which is helping fuel a virtuous circle of new company formation, especially when founders exit and recycle the proceeds into new companies.</p><p>He says more than 50,000 people in the UK have now had experience of working for a technology \"unicorn\" and two million people work for tech companies while about one million job openings exist in the industry.</p><p>What about the impact of Brexit on confidence in the UK? </p><p>Klein shrugs and looks relaxed. \"The referendum vote was on June 23, 2016. You know, the amount of venture capital coming into the market the year after that increased. The amount of venture capital coming in the year after that increased and the year after that it increased again.\" </p><p>Warming to his theme, he continues: \"So quite frankly, whatever the political weather, the UK's strength now lies in an ecosystem it's taken 20 years to build, that now has a disproportionate supply of venture capital, a disproportionate supply of unicorns, futurecorns and exited unicorns.\"</p><p>French and German efforts to lure startups across the channel simply won't change this fundamental reality, he says.</p><p>\"A couple of years ago at the height of Macron and Merkel, there was a lot of 'come to Paris, come to Berlin'. In the UK, we weren't playing to our strengths and the strength really is the facts. You know, we're not throwing in lunch at the Elysee Palace. It's the facts: Paris is Oxbridge, when it comes to unicorns. London's on another planet. This is a network effects industry where the ecosystems really, really matter.\"</p><p>So what should Britain aim to do next? How can it build on its record of success in a future outside the EU.</p><p>Klein, who is also a non executive at Kano Computing, the chairman of Seedcamp, a board member at both MyHeritage and Mind Candy, and a trustee at Comic Relief, believes a clear opportunity exists for the UK to adopt a leadership position. </p><p>\"The area where the UK can and always has punched above its weight is in terms of value systems - rule of law, democracy, governance,\" he says, stressing that traditionally this is not a field where either the US or China has excelled. </p><p>\"The UK and London has a 500 year track record. We've had our ups and downs but generally the UK is globally recognised as pretty good at governance. So we're now moving into an era where the governance of technology is maybe more fundamental than the technology itself.\"</p><p>He believes the UK has an enormous opportunity to influence and establish governance norms for technology that could have a global impact. </p><p>\"We're in a moment in history where people are crying out for some structure.\"</p><p>That's why he believes the UK should spearhead the global push to create a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/19/five-steps-boris-can-take-right-now-boost-britains-tech-sector/\">regulatory framework for Big Tech</url> - an area in which it is already leading the way with publication of the Online Harms White Paper produced by the Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS).</p><p>The creation of a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation is another step in the right direction, he says.</p><p>\"Where do we want to be number one? I would say values,\" he says. </p><p>And how should the UK technology industry view Britain's new government and an end to over three years of political uncertainty?</p><p>\"For me, it's very simple. Just get back on the front foot, which I think people already starting to do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58833998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSP-JG01-JCJY-G206-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, took an important step in that direction yesterday by demanding a review of the competition-distorting behaviour of the tech giants. The call to arms included tighter controls on online advertising revenue and tax dodging schemes as well as the protection of the public from online harassment.</p><p>The chancellor commissioned a report last year from a panel of economists, led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman. \"There are a lot of benefits to the digital sector,\" says Mr Furman, \"but when you have these large companies that are so dominant in so many markets, consumers do not have the choices they should have.\" If his conclusions are adopted, some blatant monopolistic practices of the tech giants could be open to robust challenge. They include a code of conduct to be policed by an independent regulator.</p><p>The digital economy has been at the heart of an extraordinary transformation of society, providing services and products at low prices. The cost of starting and scaling up a business has been cut with the help of cloud computing and digital comparison tools. Yet this is due overwhelmingly to the US giants that have squeezed the oxygen out of smaller start-ups. When growth threatens to slow, the whale swallows the minnows. Over the past decade the big five, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, have swallowed more than 400 companies that could have been rivals.</p><p>The report is an answer to a steady drumbeat of discontent. One is big tech's refusal to accept that they are publishers and curate their content. Young users, in particular, are vulnerable to unfiltered online abuse. It took years of pressure before Instagram banned graphic images of self-harm. Furthermore the tax paid by these companies is often derisory. There is a growing sense among users that their privacy is not adequately respected and that complaints are brushed off.</p><p>Last month the Cairncross Review, which investigated threats to high-quality journalism in Britain, warned that the domination of digital advertising by Google and Facebook was making it difficult for publishers and newspapers to survive. Out of a British digital advertising spend of \u00a311.55 billion in 2017, Google and Facebook took 54 per cent. The Furman Review takes up the issue. Google, it suggests, will tighten its grip on advertising as technology becomes more sophisticated. Not only publishers but consumers and advertisers will lose out to the Google business model. Voices, including News Corp, owner of The Times, are calling for the break-up of Google, saying that its dominance \"strikes at the heart of our system of democracy\". Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential runner, has also called for the dismantling of the tech giants. The Furman report stops short of this, saying that it would make the business environment \"more uncertain and particularly risky\". Yet a consensus is emerging that tighter regulation is needed even though no one is quite sure how to get there. The chancellor, too, may come to the conclusion that these giants are too big, too predatory and willing to destroy too many public-interest publishers. If so, curbing them, or indeed breaking them up, may be the best solution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147329237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-M0F1-DYTY-C22G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, took an important step in that direction yesterday by demanding a review of the competition-distorting behaviour of the tech giants. The call to arms included tighter controls on online advertising revenue and tax dodging schemes as well as the protection of the public from online harassment.</p><p>The chancellor commissioned a report last year from a panel of economists, led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman. \"There are a lot of benefits to the digital sector,\" says Mr Furman, \"but when you have these large companies that are so dominant in so many markets, consumers do not have the choices they should have.\" If his conclusions are adopted, some blatant monopolistic practices of the tech giants could be open to robust challenge. They include a code of conduct to be policed by an independent regulator.</p><p>The digital economy has been at the heart of an extraordinary transformation of society, providing services and products at low prices. The cost of starting and scaling up a business has been cut with the help of cloud computing and digital comparison tools. Yet this is due overwhelmingly to the US giants that have squeezed the oxygen out of smaller start-ups. When growth threatens to slow, the whale swallows the minnows. Over the past decade the big five, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, have swallowed more than 400 companies that could have been rivals.</p><p>The report is an answer to a steady drumbeat of discontent. One is big tech's refusal to accept that they are publishers and curate their content. Young users, in particular, are vulnerable to unfiltered online abuse. It took years of pressure before Instagram banned graphic images of self-harm. Furthermore the tax paid by these companies is often derisory. There is a growing sense among users that their privacy is not adequately respected and that complaints are brushed off.</p><p>Last month the Cairncross Review, which investigated threats to high-quality journalism in Britain, warned that the domination of digital advertising by Google and Facebook was making it difficult for publishers and newspapers to survive. Out of a British digital advertising spend of \u00a311.55 billion in 2017, Google and Facebook took 54 per cent. The Furman Review takes up the issue. Google, it suggests, will tighten its grip on advertising as technology becomes more sophisticated. Not only publishers but consumers and advertisers will lose out to the Google business model. Voices, including News Corp, owner of The Times, are calling for the break-up of Google, saying that its dominance \"strikes at the heart of our system of democracy\". Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential runner, has also called for the dismantling of the tech giants. The Furman report stops short of this, saying that it would make the business environment \"more uncertain and particularly risky\". Yet a consensus is emerging that tighter regulation is needed even though no one is quite sure how to get there. The chancellor, too, may come to the conclusion that these giants are too big, too predatory and willing to destroy too many public-interest publishers. If so, curbing them, or indeed breaking them up, may be the best solution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147341709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-M0F1-DYTY-C2JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Apple and Google parent Alphabet were down 0.4 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.  </p><p>  \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ's antitrust team, said in a statement.  </p><p>  The review will consider \"the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,\" the DOJ said.  </p><p>  The agency has the authority to push to break up companies it finds hold too much power, like it did with AT&amp;T in the 1980s, although that process took nearly a decade.  </p><p>  The DOJ crackdown comes as Silicon Valley's top companies face unprecedented scrutiny of their business practices, including claims from President Trump that tech giants meddle with his coverage and Twitter following - and calls by presidential candidates to break up the nation's biggest tech companies.  </p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, is still facing fallout for letting British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica hoover up the personal data of nearly 90 million Facebook users leading up to the 2016 presidential election - including a record $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission that is expected to be announced Wednesday.  </p><p>  Trump slammed Google last year for prioritizing negative coverage of him in search results, and accused Twitter in April of deleting his followers.  </p><p>Google has denied \"a political agenda,\" and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey held an impromptu sitdown with Trump to explain that Twitter was purging spam accounting.  </p><p>  Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, has made the breakup of big tech companies - including Google, Apple and Amazon - one of her top initiatives.  </p><p>  \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy,\" Warren tweeted in May. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\" </p><p>  It's not just US politicians and regulators that are pressuring Silicon Valley. The European Commission last week opened a formal antitrust investigation into whether Amazon uses data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace to compete against them.  </p><p>  And in July, the EC slapped Google with a $4.9 billion fine for pitching its Android operating system for phones as \"open\" while placing restrictions on phone makers to ensure its internet browser, Google Chrome, was the only browser pre-installed on Android phones. </p><p>Apple is reportedly being probed by the EC over complaints by Swedish company Spotify that its App Store rules favor its own apps over those from competitors.  </p><p>  It was previously reported that the DOJ was looking into investigating Alphabet, run by Google co-founder Larry Page, and Apple for potential anti-competitive practices - while leaving probes into Facebook and Amazon to the FTC.  </p><p>  The DOJ's announcement arrives a week after President Trump tweeted that his administration will probe billionaire Peter Thiel's claim that Google has \"seemingly treasonous\" ties with China. </p><p>   With Post Wires </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Focal points: A fed antitrust probe looking into the practices of these big US tech names is on the march.

It's time to turn  it over to Maria Bartiromo.  Good morning Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there ladies, good  morning to you.  Happy Thursday and good morning everybody, thanks for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Facebook unfriended on Wall Street that's for sure, the stock is plunging  this morning on the edge of the plunge last night, disappointing sales and  revenue guidance.  Nearly $150 billion wiped from market value in the  afterhours trading session.  Incredible drop on Facebook, down seventeen  and a quarter percent right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the sector for sure, the big  names in technology this morning under pressure.  Take a look at Twitter  down three percent and Alphabet, parents of Google down and a third  percent.  Amazon will report its earnings after the close tonight.  Ahead  of that, the stock is down one and a three quarters percent.</p><p> Broader markets this morning look like this, in fact, it's a mixed story.   Dow Industrials are up 50 points but look at the NASDAQ where we've got so  many technology names there and that is down almost one percent, 60 points  lower on the NASDAQ this morning.</p><p> There's wild session on Wall Street yesterday, stock surge in the last 30  minutes of trading.  On news of a softening trade dispute between the U.S.  and the E.U.  President Trump talking about working toward zero tariffs.   Yesterday, the Dow Industrials up 172 points at the close with that huge  rally in the final 30 minutes.  The NASDAQ was up 91 points, better than  one percent.</p><p> In Europe this morning investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank in a sense of when rising interest rates might be on the  horizon.  What happens next with European stimulus.  The European markets  are fractionally better on the session with the CAC Quarante in Paris up  three quarters of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up one and a  third percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets mostly lower at the close, as you can see best  performer was Korea.  Kospi Index up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p> Easing trade tensions, President Trump and European Commission President  Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to negotiate a  trade deal.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Over the years the United  States has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars with the European  Union and we just want it to be a level playing field for our farmers, for  our manufacturers, for everybody.</p><p> And we also want a big beneficiary to be the European Union, so we think it  can be good for everybody.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This morning we take a look at the key issues at stake coming  up right now.  Plus, an explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the  only person injured was the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We  have the very latest on this investigation coming up.</p><p> President Trump star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame destroyed.  Take a look,  the suspect using a pick axe and later charged with felony vandalism.  We  will tell you who is bailing him out of jail this morning, coming up.</p><p> Plus, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones standing firm in his support for the  national anthem, he says all players will be required to stand during the  national anthem.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Former NFL Star and  the Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer with us this morning.  Along with CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Good to see you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of news this morning.</p><p> JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  It's going to be a good one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.  Facebook obviously the story of the moment  Lindsey.  Is that going to be an overhang over the -- over the broader  markets in your view?</p><p> BELL:  You know what, I think it will be an overhang on the tech sector  today but hopefully Amazon can turn the ship around this evening when they  report results.</p><p> I think one thing to note about tech and the overall market in general is  going into the earning season.  I was really concerned about CAPEX  declining because it had been up on average 40 percent over the last three  quarters.</p><p> But you saw even though Facebook's numbers weren't great and the outlook  was poor, they increase CAPEX spending, so did Google.  They more -- they  like doubled it.  And then you're also seeing industrial companies  increased their CAPEX, so it's very good for future growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That conference call really sounded wild last night Dagen.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Again, there's an  incredible, what they call in journalism a tick tock in the Wall Street  Journal about that conference call.  How Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl  Sandberg come on the call and talk about how awesome business is and  Instagram is so amazing.</p><p> And then the chief financial officer comes on and drops one bomb after  another in terms of talking about the growth -- revenue growth rate isn't  just slowing in the second quarter but it's going to continue to do that in  the third and fourth quarter. </p><p> There was trouble because of the new European regulations.  Currency  headwinds, new privacy options for users, he -- that was part of the blame  but he said that new ad formats such as those within the Instagram stories  are not pulling the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and  Instagram feeds.  So there's a lot of bad news in there.  </p><p> Just putting exclamation point on it, we had Facebook at a new all-time  high yesterday.  In one day the stock is almost in bear market territory.   In one day it went from an all-time high to nearly a bear market which  would be a 20 percent drop.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Seventy percent drop right now and I guess it became clear last  night that all those investment into security, into privacy as a result of  what's been going on with privacy is going to cut into growth.</p><p> Bottom line, Facebook is not going to be immune to this.  You mentioned  story segments section in Instagram, that's not going to bring the margins  that the rest of the company has been bringing, that's the bottom line.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  So they're going to have to figure out--again, because  the story is a memo--it's sort of an offshoot of Snapchat, they put those  in place to take on Snapchat because they're --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where it goes away in 24 hours.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  They're -- but I -- following those stories and using  them, there are ways that they can better integrate the actual -- to  monetize those and then to place the ads in those stories.  So they're  asking for a long runway.  Well today, investors are not giving an answer  on them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BELL:  It says margins are getting cut going forward because of all this  and their investments especially in security.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, this is the group that has been the  leadership in terms of gains for the broader markets.  This is where the  money has been moving.  So there's probably expectations up here and the  realities over here.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And just real quick, because I'm not a phony, that was an  outstanding news coming out of the White House yesterday, that's exactly  what investors needed to hear in terms of cooling the tariff tensions, the  trade tensions and giving kind of some insights to the road ahead, a  renegotiating trade deals.  Maybe even with Europe which is a goal but then  NAFTA and then taking on China. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Markets obviously reacted to that immediately.  The president  comes out with Mr. Juncker and starts talking about working towards zero  tariffs which by the way was exactly what the president has been trying to  get for -- from a lot of these players.  </p><p> Yesterday we heard from a number of players that Mexico may be next.  We'll  see if they can do a deal with Mexico and then Canada follows along.  This  whole wild, you know, upset over the tariffs will go away.  So we'll see.   And then there's the NFL Jack Brewer, what do you think about Jerry Jones?</p><p> BREWER:  Ah, it's expected.  You know, Jerry has -- he stood strong, this  is not a change in his approach, in his tone in regards to this whole  situation.  You know, it's one thing to talk about kneeling with the goal  and to actually pass a policy then pull it back, go back and forth.</p><p> I'm interested in owner seat like Jerry Jones.  His fan base wants to see  his players stand for the national anthem, I understand that.  I know, I've  said this before, right, people, this is America, you can stand, you can  kneel, you can do what you want.  But if your boss tells you to stand, you  stand.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you stand.  And that's what we are this morning.  A lot of  stories to cover.  </p><p> We want to kick it off right here with our trade ceasefire story, top of  news.  President Trump headed to Granite City, Illinois this morning where  he is set to tour a steel mill that is now boosting production following  the president's move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  earlier this year.  This visit coming a day after announcing a breakthrough  in trade talks with the European Union.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We agreed today first of all to work together towards zero tariffs,  zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,  thank you.</p><p> While we are working on this, we will not go against the spirit of this  agreement unless either party terminates the negotiation.  So we're  starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it's going.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still, the tariffs on aluminum and steel are costing American  companies.  Both Coca Cola and General Motors now say they will have to  raise prices on their products in large part because of the president's  trade fights.</p><p> Joining us right now to weigh in from Washington is Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p> WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Thank you for having me on Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a big deal yesterday with the president and Mr.  Juncker.  Can you go through what was -- what was agreed upon?</p><p> ROSS:  Surely.  The objectives of a new trade negotiation have been very  firmly set, zero -- we're going towards zero tariffs, zero nontariff trade  barriers, zero subsidies.</p><p> So that should really level the playing field and enable American companies  to be fully competitive and get the kind of market access that they need.   Meanwhile, the steel and aluminum tariffs stay in place, we will continue  pursuing our investigation of the Automotive 232 and hopefully these  negotiations will be completed fairly quickly so that we can get to the  stable situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So is the plan to eventually do away with the aluminum and  steel tariffs or the auto tariffs?  I mean, even on light trucks the U.S.  charges, what, 255 percent, right?</p><p> ROSS:  Well you notice on light trucks, the -- there was an exception for  automotive products.  It's said we'd work toward zero tariffs on  nonautomotive industrial products.  And to steel and aluminum, there's no  attention to abandon those industries.</p><p> So the president is very happy with the progress they have made and opening  new facilities.  I'm joining them today as we go out to visit one that had  just recently been reopened.  He's not going to do anything to destroy  steel and aluminum from their new found substance.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was there a timeline discussed Secretary in terms of when we  might see actual clarity on what the trade deal will look like between the  U.S. and the E.U.?</p><p> ROSS:  There's no precise time table set because that's not a meaningful  thing.  But the president made it very clear he is not going to sit around  for the normal two, three years to get a trade deal done.</p><p> Since we've got the broad principals agreed, it now should be more filling  in the blanks than starting from ground zero.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what do you think about these tariffs hitting Detroit?   General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler all yesterday lowered guidance.   Are you suggesting their full year outlook says they revealed lower than  expected second quarter earnings, all of which were impacted by the rising  cost of steel and aluminum.</p><p> So Mr. Secretary, will the president's negotiations with the E.U. reverse  what's going on with the automakers?  We are already seeing that they're  expecting this to impact their business.</p><p> ROSS:  Well, I have said before, the impact of steel and aluminum on the  auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about one percent on the  cost of the vehicle.  </p><p> So to the degree that that might be passed along, that's possible.  But the  offsetting thing is what you're seeing unemployment figures.  Record low  unemployment, more jobs available than there are people available to fill  them for the first time ever.</p><p> Record low unemployment for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for women,  for young people.  I mean, the economy is booming and that's what's really  important.  The other important thing though is the president has made  clear he's not going to abandon the industries that just has helped to  revitalized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what's the next priority then Wilbur?  We've been  talking a lot about the potential for a deal with Mexico.  Is that the  priority now as you continue to work with the E.U.?</p><p> ROSS:  Well we're working on a lot of different fronts all at the same  time.  And that shows you the speed and the breath of the president's  sculpt of these trace issues.</p><p> We have to get them fixed in a fairly short period of time.  They've gone  on too long, unchecked by prior administrations.  As to Mexico, the new  president very quickly appointed the team that would do the trade  negotiations for him has made very clear he wants to get a deal done.</p><p> And he did all of this without even waiting for his inauguration.  He'll be  inaugurated on the first of December and it looks pretty clear that his  goal would be to try to get something resolved between the United States  and Mexico prior to even his inauguration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think you -- is it fair to say then the change in  leadership in Mexico also was very positive toward better relations with  the U.S.?</p><p> ROSS:  Well potentially so.  It certainly has made us all feel a lot better  than we did during some of the campaign rhetoric.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you think that Canada will be close behind once you do do a  deal -- a new NAFTA deal with Mexico?</p><p> ROSS:  Well we hope so but the immediate focus is much more on Mexico.  The  issues there are more complex and we think we can get very good progress  very quickly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  Let me move on to China Secretary, the president  there said this morning that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.  Your reaction to what's coming out of China?  </p><p> Do you feel that you've been able to move the needle yet in terms of their  theft of intellectual property and technology?</p><p> ROSS:  Well we haven't seen any formal steps to resolve those issues.  But  you see these repeated announcements coming out of China, things that  they're doing with the banking system bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.</p><p> Clearly, they're feeling a pressure from the tariffs that the president has  put on and equally clearly they're having some difficulty implementing  their retaliatory tariffs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you feel better now that there's this agreement in place  with the E.U. potentially teaming up with the E.U. against China to  pressure China to stop bad behavior?</p><p> ROSS:  Well as we know, the E.U. has suggested several times publicly that  they hope they could resolve things with us so that they could join with us  very aggressively in dealings with China.</p><p> We'll have to see what turns out from that but it certainly is a good step  regardless what happens with China to move toward a level playing field and  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barrier and zero subsidy environment with the  E.U.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  A lot of great information Secretary, good to see  you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p> ROSS:  Thanks Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us there.  Coming up, breaking  overnight, an explosion outside the U.S. Embassy in China.  We will have  the very latest on this Beijing blast.  </p><p> Then big oil, big profits.  Analysts predicting another huge earning  season, we're taking a closer look at big oil as they start reporting  today.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A bomb exploding near the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing overnight, Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines.   Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  We're trying to get more  details Maria but here's what we know so far, police say the blast injured  the 26-year-old man, he was holding the device.</p><p> It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is from  Mongolia.  The motive though, we don't know at this point.  The U.S.  Embassy was not damaged and thankfully no U.S. personnel or anyone in the  area were hurt by this blast.</p><p> Well, Qualcomm now planning to scrap its plan to buy NXP semiconductors  after the deadline passed at midnight without any word on Chinese  regulatory approval.  China was the last of nine markets, they needed to  approve the $44 billion deal.</p><p> This appears to be the latest victim of U.S.-China trade tensions.  Shares  of Qualcomm, well, they're saving some money I guess, think of it that way.   The stock is up a little more than five percent in the premarket right now.  </p><p> All right.  Some other companies we want to talk about, Royal Dutch Shell  reporting its second quarter earnings jumping about 30 percent.  Net income  rise in the $6.02 billion from $1.54 billion from a year earlier.  He oil  company is obviously benefiting from higher energy prices.  Shell now plans  to buy back about $25 billion of its stock over the next two years.  </p><p> They made that announcement.  Shares of Shell, lower in the premarket, down  almost two and a half percent.  The earnings missed analysts estimates but  sell over of a mix back for Shell.  A lot of more earnings coming up,  Amazon as well today Maria.  So a lot of big names.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Amazon after the bell.  And Qualcomm also  this morning announcing it's going to be buying back $30 billion of stock.   Buybacks continuing as well.  Cheryl, Thank you.</p><p> Coming up, if you're suit up to play, stand for the national anthem.   That's the mandate from the owner of the Dallas Cowboys this morning.  It  is the latest twist in this controversy.  </p><p> Then this, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame is smashed to pieces  again, you won't believe who bailed this guy out of jail after he did that.   Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Standing for the national anthem, Jared Max now  with the latest on the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' new requirement.   Jared, good morning.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  New and similar to what we've seen  Maria.  Jerry Jones hasn't really waffled in his public stance on the  importance of his players, the men he employs and pays handsomely to stand  for the national anthem.</p><p> While there is currently no active policy on the anthem as the NFL and  Players Association said last week in a joint statement, they are working  toward resolution privately.  Yesterday Jones spoke out publicly.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JERRY JONES, OWNER, DALLAS COWBOY:  Obviously wouldn't dare speak for any  of the other owners much less in general about 31 other owners.  But as far  as the Dallas Cowboys are concerned, you know where I stand.</p><p> It's our position that we've always had a written policy in place.  Our  policy is that you stand at the anthem, tow on the line.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Tow on the line.  But what about actions speak louder than words?   Remember last season after President Trump had weighed in heavily on the  anthem, Jones joined his players and team staff at a momentary kneel before  they stood for the anthem.  Jerry Jones, where are you today on President  Trump?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONES:  His interest in what we're doing is problematic from my chair and I  would say in general the owner's share.  It's unprecedented if you really  think about it.  Like the very game itself, that's the way it is and we'll  deal with it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  And for now there are no new national anthem policies into the NFL,  the League and Players Association said last week it will be several weeks  before we have a policy in place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Your reaction Jack?</p><p> BREWER:  Well I got two things to say, you know, we talked about this for a  long time and I don't think it's going anywhere.  You know, the National  Football League is the largest wealth creator for young African-American  men in this country.</p><p> And I just hate to see anything being done that's going to take away from  that.  I don't want to piss off any fans, I don't want make anyone upset,  because I know that those revenues and those resources that are going into  communities of color because of these African-American men getting wealth,  I want to keep that going.</p><p> And so I'll say that first.  The second thing I'll say is there are so many  issues that are facing NFL players, we talked about this before Jared  particularly with concussions and you have all of the drug issues with  giving guys too many opioids and all of the crisis that are going on, let's  talk about that too Jared.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.  And --</p><p> BREWER:  I mean --</p><p> MAX:  -- players, also the retired players --</p><p> BREWER:  Exactly.</p><p> MAX:  -- you know, we hear -- you know, we're waiting for a lot of money  from NFL settlements.  But, again, this anthem issue Maria is tremendous.   Jerry Jones, I think speaks the volumes when he says I like everybody would  like for this to go away because very much, you know, sports is always the  divider where we didn't get politics into sports, that's where we went to  get away --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MAX:  -- from that.  But here we have this intersection where it doesn't  necessarily work for everybody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  I like what Jack said earlier, if your boss tells you to  stand you do it.  If my boss tells me to stand giving a presentation, I'm  going to do it, you know.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  I mean it's --</p><p> BREWER:  And with football, it's even deeper because we know, we do  everything uniform, right?  You have -- you wear the same socks, you go to  pull them up, you wear the same uniform.  You can't wear Adidas, you got to  wear Nike.</p><p> You know, there's rules.  So I'm a big believer in that.  You know, I  listen to my dad, I listen to my teacher, I listen to law enforcement.  I  think, you know, that is a reflection of the new society that we have.  You  know, we've got to start respecting authority again.  We got to start  listening.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you say the NFL is this great wealth creator, that's  because of America.  </p><p> BREWER:  One hundred percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know.</p><p> BREWER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's more than just your boss tells you to stand up, it's  because you're honoring America and the flag.  </p><p> BREWER:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But a lot -- but you'll agree with this and it comes down to the  issue of when you go to work, you have to abide by your employer's rules  and it's -- and it's different in NFL because there's a player's contract,  there's a union contract with the league.</p><p> But I can't say whatever I feel like quite frankly, certainly not even in  my private life.  Is Twitter my private account or is it part of an  extension of where I work?  I can't say or do whatever I want and not face  any consequences.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though we firmly believe in the first amendment, the right  to free speech and a free press.  It -- that is not an unbridled right in  this country.  And when you're in the workplace, you kind of have -- like  you said, there are rules in the NFL and there will be rules about what you  can say and do during the national anthem.</p><p> BREWER:  Right.</p><p> MAX:  And they're working it out.  Hopefully they're going to work it out.   Nobody has got here.  Roger Goodell isn't, President Trump isn't.  This is  -- this is working it out, you know, in a sense of just we're going to do  it for the first time, we don't have the answers, right?  We don't have the  answers.  The other leagues stand.  The other leagues stand.  So --</p><p> BREWER:  That's why (INAUDIBLE) they're not picking on the NFL.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p> BREWER:  They're not doing anything than any other sports league. </p><p> MAX:  And two other football leagues coming.</p><p> BREWER:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's  sports report on FOX News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio on XM115.  </p><p> We'll take a break, we got a lot going on this morning.  Coming up,  removing Rod Rosenstein, a group of House Republicans have introduced  articles of impeachment against the Deputy Attorney General.  More on that  move and whether or not it will take him out.</p><p> Then Wal-Mart driving sales in a whole new way, a glimpse into the future  of shopping right here.  </p><p> Plus, the latest on Facebook, setting the tone for market this morning,  down 17 percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 26th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Investors disconnecting from Facebook, this morning, the stock is getting  hammered after the company reported disappointing sales and revenue  guidance, the company lost $150 billion in market value, yesterday alone.   The conference call created some confusion in terms of will the company  continue to be able to grow the way it has, 30 percent, looks like, not.</p><p> Futures this morning, indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages,  take a look, Dow Industrials up 24, but the NASDAQ, taking a hit hard, down  almost one percent, largely on weakness on technology on the heels of  Facebook.  </p><p> Stocks surged in last 30 minutes of trading, yesterday, on reports of a  softening trade dispute between the E.U. and the U.S.  They -- the two  leaders, yesterday, came out and said that they are working toward a zero  policy, zero tariffs, and zero subsidies between the two.</p><p> In Europe this morning, investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank.  We will get a sense of when rising interest rates might be  on the horizon.  FT-100 is flat this morning, but the CAC Quarante is up a  third of a percent.  The DAX Index in Germany up better than one percent.  </p><p> Asian markets closed lower, mostly, overnight, with the exception of Korea.   Worst performer was China.  Shanghai composite down three quarters of one  percent.  </p><p> Easing the trade tip, President Trump coming away from his meeting with the  European Commission president, with a renewed sense of optimism after  making progress toward a deal.  </p><p> Meanwhile, a call for impeachment, Conservative lawmakers were taking the  first steps to try to impeach Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  We  are taking a look at whether this resolution has a path forward, straight  ahead.</p><p> President Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized,  again.  You won't believe who is helping the vandal get out of jail, this  morning.  And if you're shopping at Wal-Mart, your next ride could be a  self-driving car.  Details on the retailers partnership with Waymo, coming  up this hour.</p><p> All that coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour, House  Republicans versus the Justice Department, House Conservatives filing  articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p> The move coming after months of back and forth over documents related to  the Hillary Clinton and Trump investigations.  Congressman Mark Meadows and  Jim Jordan who filed the articles of impeachment, spoke with Fox News'  Laura Engram, last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  Well, we get the documents or we  impeach him.  And the only thing that we have control over is the ability  to bring impeachment straight to the floor.</p><p> REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  When was the last time you ever saw the FBI  take a disproven document with no credibility, no validity, no  corroboration, take it to a secret court, not tell the court who paid for  it, not tell the court that the guy who had wrote it had been leaking  information to the press, and not just once, four stinking times, and the  last one, Rod Rosenstein signed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Christopher  Bedford, he's the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Caller.  Chris, good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you the think this has legs impeaching Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> BEDFORD:  More on the public relations front, it seems.  The Conservatives  have been frustrated for a number of weeks.  And this document, the  articles of impeachment, has been circulating leadership and the  Republicans have been trying to tamp down on it, and say, guys, hold on a  second.  </p><p> Department of Justice have been meeting with people, just last night,  meeting with congressman in the Hill to try and see if they could figure  out a way to avoid this.  But Meadows and Jordan are pushing on.  Now, what  they would need, they need to force votes.  They haven't done yet.  </p><p> Right now, they referred it to the judiciary committee.  They could do that  as early as today, and then it would take two days or maybe longer to force  a vote.  But they would need half of the U.S. Congress to impeach him, and  they would need two thirds of the U.S. Congress to actually remove him.   And since Republicans are so split on this, I don't see either of those  things happening.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, the documents that have been delayed, do you  think this maybe puts a fire under the DOJ to get those documents to the  congressional investigators?</p><p> BEDFORD:  It's one of the arrows in the repertoire here.  It's difficult to  try and put a fire under the DOJ and then Jordan and Meadows have been  saying that they're having more trouble getting documents out of out of  this DOJ or as much as they had under Eric Holder's DOJ, the Obama  administration's DOJ.  They are redacting information that's embarrassing.  </p><p> They're not being forthcoming and what it seems to be the last draw for the  Conservatives, was Rosenstein signing off on the actual -- on the -- on the  FISA court that used the discredited dossier, that seems to have been the  last straw that pushed Conservatives over and said, you know what, we're  going to push this out now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Meadows -- Chris, it's Dagen McDowell, Meadows, last night, on  Laura Ingraham show, kind of hinted that they could make this resolution  live today, that would force a vote in the House.  However, after -- I  think there's a vote this morning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  After that,  Congress is gone until September the Fourth, so --</p><p> BEDFORD:  It would take a while for them to be able to do that.  So they  move very quickly this morning and very few things move very quickly in  Congress.  They can potentially force a vote that would have to be made  within the next two days.  </p><p> But as you said with recess coming up, this seems like it's more trying to  draw attention to the battle the Conservatives are having with DOJ than  actually realistic effort to remove the attorney general -- deputy attorney  general.  </p><p> BREWER:  Chris, this is Jack Brewer, how much did the past Trump-Putin  summit hurt the rally of support around this latest effort?</p><p> BEDFORD:  I strongly suspect that that was the reason we didn't see this  last week because the Conservatives have been pushing to move this last  week, and then after Trump took so much -- President Trump took so much  criticism over how he appeared to handle the summit, they -- I think they  held it off over a week and seems like it was dead.  </p><p> We had reporters that were ready to break the news that was happening.  But  we assumed that it was dead, and heard that it was dead after that summit.   And then I think what really pushed it over again was signing the warrant  here on the evidence here for the FISA warrant.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we knew that he signed off on the FISA warrant for  the fourth time.  We've known that for some time.  National Security  Adviser, John Bolton, commented on a future Trump-Putin summit.  </p><p> He issued this statement saying this, the President believes that the next  bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia  witch-hunt is over, so we've agreed that it will be after the first of the  year.</p><p> This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified yesterday before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defending the administration's policies  on Russia.  I thought he did really well.  Check out this exchange he had  with the Democratic Senator that was Chris Murphy.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT:  How do I know the difference between a  presidential statement that is not a policy and a statement that is?</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  Senator, here's what you  should look at, compare the following, Barack Obama speaking tough on  Russia and doing nothing.</p><p> MURPHY:  Those are true.</p><p> POMPEO:  It is true.</p><p> MURPHY:  I understand you want to rewrite the Obama policy on Russia.  But  that's simply --</p><p> POMPEO:  OK.  </p><p> MURPHY:  He organized all of Europe and all over the world.  </p><p> POMPEO:  Let's go.  Let's go, Senator.  Let's go.  Let's go task to task.</p><p> MURPHY:  To put a comprehensive on president instead of sanctions on  Russia.</p><p> POMPEO:  The man said he would have more flexibility after --</p><p> MURPHY:  I'm not listening --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on what took place yesterday, and what do  you think the Russia policy is going forward?</p><p> BEDFORD:  It was a pretty fiery exchange, the Secretary came absolutely  ready to do battle.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He did.</p><p> BEDFORD:  I really enjoyed some of the back and forth, that was -- it was  good television.  But I'm not sure how much further we got toward  understanding much.  I think he made a forceful defense of the  administration here, when he pointed out to the senators who were doubtful.  </p><p> That President Trump and his administration are not -- or inseparable, if  the administration doubles down on sanctions, removes more spies, shuts  down more compounds, deregulates energy, sends natural gas to Europe,  pushes for a stronger NATO, lethal aid to Ukraine, missiles back to Poland,  those aren't actions that take place without the President.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BEDFORD:  His signatures on every one of those.  And the Senate didn't seem  to want to believe that and they were really seemingly trying to push a  narrative that was different.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he said a couple of times.  This is President Trump's  state department.  So, President Trump, at the end of the day, is in charge  of this decision-making.  But I thought it was really interesting the way  he defended the private meeting, the one-on-one with Putin.  He did a very  good job on that, Dagen, what did you think?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Incredibly measured.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And any of us watching the Secretary of State, had to sit there,  and listen to the garbage that was pouring out of the mouths of the  Democrats.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We tip our hats --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They put on a show.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And by the way, in terms of the level of insanity among  Democrats about Russia, Chuck Schumer, yesterday, was talking about the aid  to farmers because of the tariff fight that we've got into, as something  from the Soviet Union.</p><p> Number one, when did a Democrat hate a handout?  And number two, they have  to somehow link that whether you like it or not, to Russia and Putin and  the USSR, Chris, that -- again, that is something that does not resonate  with most Americans.</p><p> BEDFORD:  The USSR comparisons I saw yesterday were absolutely shameful.   Comparing President Trump's economic policy to the five-year plan, last  time I heard President Trump wasn't rounding up millions of Americans and  putting them in industrial labor camps at North Dakota and executing them  in mass.  </p><p> There was absolutely no comparison between aiding farmers during a trade  war that the administration is intending to win.  It doesn't want to leave  casualties in the battlefield.  And then Stalin asked economic planning  which murdered millions of people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  It's pathetic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was pathetic, it was shameful, but it was more of the same,  right?  So, you know, with the immigration story, the next thing is abolish  ICE.  You know, I mean, they just go way too far with the analysis here.  </p><p> The Russia-Putin strategy, though, do you think it has been tougher than  the Obama administration?  I mean, that's a fair statement that regardless  of what happened in Helsinki at that press conference, the actual policies  have been tough on Russia?</p><p> BEDFORD:  Demonstrably tougher.  Every single difficult or tough step that  the Obama administration took, President Trump's administration has  maintained and then doubled down on most of those being economic and people  being deported or expelled from the country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> BEDFORD:  In addition to that, the lethal aid and the energy aid to Europe  have been absolutely crucial.  The Russia gets its courage from energy  prices, deregulating the U.S. energy industry and sending natural gas to  Europe, that hurts Russia directly in its pocketbook.  </p><p> And being willing to about -- talk to Russia or as Secretary Pompeo said  (INAUDIBLE) remote chances are that we could come to an understanding with  Russia is something that should be pursued by any administration --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BEDFORD:  in the meantime.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that was a topic that was discussed yesterday with Mr.  Juncker, as well.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, it was.  I just -- Chris, I just wonder, there wasn't a lot of  information that came out of this and maybe that is to the secretaries --  you know --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By design?</p><p> BELL:  Yes, by design.  But the question is, though, does this lead to a  request for the translator to come in or for the Senate to see their notes?</p><p> BEDFORD:  The level of partisanship that we've seen that's absolutely  possible, we have seen the translators, the gentleman who translated for  President Bush, President Barack Obama, President Clinton, saying that this  President would be obscene.  </p><p> The ability for a leader to be able to have a private discussion with a  member of a cabinet or another foreign leader is critical.  I think it  would be a bad step.  </p><p> And if Republicans would very likely try as best they could to hold the  line, although people like Senator John McCain, have shown that they're  really disappointed in President Trump's interactions with Putin.  And they  may switch, also Senator Bob Corker who is one of the leaders yesterday in  grilling the Secretary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the Secretary kept saying things like, well, look,  you do a private meeting and you keep it private because you're hoping to  have a second private meeting, and to actually make progress, and he kept  saying it back to them.  I'm sure you've had one-on-one meetings.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was a gift, though, to delay the second meeting with Putin,  to delay it after the midterm elections, that's just a gift to anybody  running -- any Republican running for re-election because they can focus on  the issues and the things that truly matter to the American people, like  this booming economy, and not the tete-a-tete with Putin and Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, great point.  Chris, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, Christopher Bedford, Daily Caller, there.   Coming up, days after a fatal shooting rampage in Toronto, officials there  want to ban handgun sales, more on that plan, coming up.  </p><p> Then, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame, smashed to pieces, once  again.  And you won't believe who reportedly wants to pay the guy's bail to  get him out of jail after doing that, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Toronto seeking a ban of handguns sales in the  city, following a deadly shooting.  Cheryl Casone on details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Maria, reaction is pretty swift there in Toronto.  The City  Council voting 41 to four to ban handgun sales along with sales of  ammunition for handguns, after two people died in shooting rampage last  Sunday.  13 others were hurt when the gunman opened fire in Toronto's great  town neighborhood.  Now, the suspect, 29-year-old, Faisal Hussein,  reportedly died after shooting himself.  Police are still looking into a  motive for that deadly attack.  </p><p> Well, back here at home, President Trump's star in the Hollywood walk of  fame has been vandalized again.  The 24-year-old vandal turned himself in  the police -- turned himself in -- after he destroyed it early Wednesday  morning.  Now, he's been held on $20,000 bail.  Here's what's interesting,  you may remember this guy, take a look at this guy who took a sledgehammer  and axe to President Trump's star just before the election in 2016.  Well,  reportedly, he wants to bail out the newest perpetrator.  Crews have  already started working to repair that damaged star.  </p><p> OK.  Waymo teaming up with Wal-Mart.  The company going to give shoppers a  lift to Wal-Mart in its self-driving cars under a pilot program.  Right  now, up to 400 people in Phoenix, Arizona -- known as early riders -- can  order their food on Wal-Mart.com, pick it up at a Waymo vehicle, and they  get dropped off back at home.  Shares of Wal-Mart are down about 10 percent  this year.  Shares of Alphabet, which is of course the parent of Waymo, up  about 20 percent, Maria.  So, you know, if you're going to pick up and take  me there and bring me, yes, I'm OK with that -- as long as it's free.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The elderly still, you know, who still want to shop for  themselves and have trouble getting into the store, how about people who  just need a helping hand?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, very important.  Yes.  Coming up, Kalahari Resorts, the  sport and entertainment leader about to team up with a fall tradition for  one of a kind partnership -- details on that high-flying deal next.  And  we're following Facebook this morning, down 17 percent; setting the tone  for markets after growth is being questioned that the company, after its  latest second quarter earnings.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, how cool is that?  That storm chaser an interactive  waterslide in videogame at Kalahari Resorts in Sandusky, Ohio.  Kalahari is  valued at a billion-dollar and just announced a new float in this year's  Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.  Joining us right is Kalahari Resorts and  Conventions Owner, Todd Nelson.  Todd, great to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> TODD NELSON, OWNER, KALAHARI RESORTS AND CONVENTIONS:  Well, great to be  back again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll get to that Macy's partnership in a second, but how's  business going, characterize the environment that you're seeing right now.  </p><p> NELSON:  Business is really solid.  The economy is great.  People are  traveling and so we were just knocking on wood every day.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you going to raise prices?  </p><p> NELSON:  No.  No, we would never do that, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Never.  Never is a long time.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How sensitive are your customers to rising gas prices?  Though,  they're not -- they're up from a year ago but -- that has eased back a  little bit.  And I just wonder because you did so well during the great  recession of 2008, part of that, you know, oil and gas prices collapsed,  but how sensitive are the customers to gas?  </p><p> NELSON:  I don't think gas prices has a huge effect on us.  We drive  through destinations in all of our resorts and that's why we did so well  during the recession.  You know, we're typically a tank-full a gas away  from our four-hour driving switches our markets.  </p><p> BELL:  So, you're opening a new location in Round Rock, Texas; how do you  pick the locations for these parks?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, that one was really interesting.  We looked at Dallas and we  looked all over the state, and then 40 to 50 percent of our business comes  through our convention center.  So, Round Rock is just centrally located  right in the middle of the state -- 20 miles our of Austin.  Fantastic.   They really get business.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, then, it's relying somewhat on the business community and  doing conventions?  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh, yes, 40 to 50 percent of our occupied rooms are.  But we're  very much into association business and in different types and even during  the recession, it really did not affect.  </p><p> BREWER:  Do you have a membership club or do you have any type of -- kind  of elite membership opportunities that you offer?  </p><p> NELSON:  No, we don't, but we are open to the community.  You don't have to  stay there to come in and enjoy our restaurants, shopping, and spa.  You  can even buy daily passes to come into the waterpark for a sustain.  So,  it's really resort-center build for everybody and every age.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why was it important to get the balloon in the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day parade for you, tell us about that partnership?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, it's actually a float.  And it's --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's water involved?</p><p> NELSON:  Yes, animatronics is involved, and it is going to be spectacular.   It's goings to be one of the Macy's -- it's just really cool.  54 million  people watch the parade.  They air it twice and in our market area, it's a  perfect partnership.  They're wonder people.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Will there be people in bathing suits on this float in the water  because it's cold here in November?  </p><p> NELSON:  Yes, I don't think there'll be anybody swimming on our float.   There is going to be a, I think, a dozen people on the float, but it's  really going to be a cool float.  We visited the studio yesterday, it's  about half finished and it's gorgeous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm actually serious, I love a good water park, so anything  that screams -- that screams water slide is awesome.  How are you  innovating in terms of the rides and the attractions in the park?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, the first ride you saw, that's a virtual reality riding --  you actually play a game as you're going down it.  What we're trying to do  is we hit all age groups.  So, if you fear -- if you want to go to swim-up  in (INAUDIBLE), that's great for our older ones.  We have 12 grandchildren  now, so we've gotten really good at the five and under.  So, every age  bracket, there's something to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute this strength in the economy in the  backdrop in your business?  </p><p> NELSON:  I think there's consumer confidence right now.  I think people are  pretty -- into the economy and they said we do well in good economies and  bad economies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did the tax plan have an impact on your business?  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The tax cut plan?</p><p> NELSON:  Yes, I think it had a real nice effect on the business.  It put  more money on people's pockets, you know.  And people have to feel good  about spending their money.  </p><p> BELL:  What about National Waterpark Day?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You said it's Saturday.  </p><p> NELSON:  It's Saturday July 28th.  We actually founded National Waterpark  Day.  It is a holiday -- it's a national holiday now, and it was quite an  interesting process, and so we're going to turn that into a big deal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Well, cheers to you and congrats, Todd.  Thanks very  much for telling us about it.  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, thank you very much, great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.

Welcome back.  Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday.  It is Thursday, July 26th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Facebook unfriended on Wall Street this morning.  The stock is plunging on  disappointing sales and revenue guidance, nearly $150 billion of market  value wiped out in the after hours trading session.  The stock right now  down about 19 percent right now.</p><p> Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the tech sector.  The biggest  names in technology under pressure this morning.  Amazon is going to be the  one to watch today.  It reports after the close.  Going into the numbers,  the stock is down one and three-quarters percent.  Check out Twitter down  3.5 percent, Snap down 4 percent.</p><p> Broader markets meanwhile look like this.  Dow Industrials are fine, up 30  points.  But the Nasdaq taking a hit on the weakness in tech.  Nasdaq down  64 points right now, almost 1 percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a  percent.</p><p> It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday particularly in the final  hour of trading.  Stocks surging in just the last 30 minutes of trading on  reports of a softening trade dispute between the U.S. and the E.U.   President Trump explained why it's important to get a trade deal in place.   Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States and the  European Union together count for more than 830 million citizens and more  than 50 percent of the global GDP.  In other words, together we're more  than 50 percent of trade.  If we team up, we can make our planet a better,  more secure and more prosperous place.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Global markets this morning reacting.  We've got the CAC 40 in  Paris up a third of a percent.  The DAX index in Germany up better than 1  percent.  The FT 100 in London up just a fraction.</p><p> In Europe investors are waiting to hear from the European Central Bank.  We  will hear from the ECB and get a sense of when interest rates will be on  the rise coming up.  And we will bring that to you as soon as it hits the  tape.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets finished mostly lower with the exception of  Korea.  That was up three-quarters of a percent.  </p><p> And then this -- censoring conservative ideas; a startling new report says  Twitter is shadow banning top Republican officials.  It's not happening to  Democrats.  The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p> Bitcoin making a comeback -- the cryptocurrency surging above $8,000 for  the first time in months -- a closer look at the crypto craze this morning.</p><p> And there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, San Francisco is  trying to take away the free food at technology companies' cafeterias.   We'll tell you why.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Former NFL star and the  Brewer Group CEO Jack Brewer with us this morning; and CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.  </p><p> JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  Great to be here. BARTIROMO:  And the big story is Facebook this morning is down now 19  percent, Lindsey -- because people are now questioning about this 30  percent growth number that we've been seeing for so long at Facebook.   Looks like that's in the rear view mirror at this point.  </p><p> BELL:  But even declining by high single digits sequentially quarter over  quarter, which is the guidance that management provided, you're still  getting 20 percent -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BELL:  -- top line growth.  Where else are you going to get that?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  But you have to wonder if the stock where it's  trading at is equal to that kind of growth versus what else we were seeing  at Facebook.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'll point to the Instagram  stories issue, because it was in the Instagram stories -- they're not  pulling in the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and in the  Instagram feeds.  </p><p> And this is particularly troubling because as of next year Facebook had  been predicting that the stories would have more essentially traffic than  the original photo feeds on Instagram.  So again, that's where they were  placing their bets.  Now they have to figure out a better way to monetize  these Facebook stories.</p><p> And they have been gaining traction.  A lot of people use those rather than  just kind of posting the run-of-the-mill photos and videos to their  Instagram feeds.  They're using those ones that disappear in 24 hours.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  I think Jack was posting a story earlier this morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What were you posting?</p><p> BREWER:  Yes.  I post the story -- I always post stories.  But they're  going to have to evolve that business model on the ad side when you talk  about stories.  I think at the end of the day you'll see over the next  maybe six to 12 months they're going to start using their influencers a  little bit more.  I think you'll see more partnerships with influencers  because those are the ones that are really driving the traffic.</p><p> Even -- look at YouTube now.  I mean if you go on YouTube now, a lot of  those ads and those pieces they're putting out, YouTube is actually  assisting the companies in producing those ads.</p><p> And so these social media companies are going to have to get more hands-on  with the way that they're putting the stories out, with the way that  they're actually generating the content.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the news on Facebook is offsetting other positive news in  terms of trade.  Markets rallied on the results of a meeting yesterday with  the European Commission's Mr. Juncker and President Trump.</p><p> Joining us right now on the telephone is LJH Investment Advisers managing  director Larry Haverty.  Larry -- thanks very much for calling in this  morning.  Your reaction to Facebook?</p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISERS:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Larry -- unfortunately, you're going in and out.  We're not  hearing you well.  Obviously, you're on a cell phone.  We would love to get  your insights on this.</p><p> But of course, $150 billion in lost market value in the after hours trading  session is what people are reacting to today.  Was it an overreaction in  your view?  </p><p> BELL:  No, I mean I think this has been a high flier.  It was up 25 percent  going into this press (ph).  There were high expectations.  And you know,  we got lucky in the first quarter.</p><p> The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not -- you didn't see it in the  numbers.  Now you're seeing it in the numbers.  There are repercussions for  this type of activity.  And there's -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially as they invest more in privacy tools.  That's going  to cost money.  </p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it's maybe short-term loss for a long-term gain.  These are  problems that have to get fixed if Facebook wants to retain this giant user  base that it has and continue to grow and monetize.  The people are using  say WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p> But to shine a spotlight on what the stock is doing, shares hit an all-time  high yesterday -- </p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and so in less than 24 hours essentially, it's gone into bear  market territory with almost down 20 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Left it all out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is so astonishing to see that.  And it is -- it's a lesson  to people when you invest in a company, a stock that has a really high  valuation on it, you better be in for the long haul.  You could lose -- if  you're going to sell today you could lose 28 percent of whatever you put in  yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The \"Journal\" story was great, going through the tick tock of  the conference call and sort of what, you know, Sheryl Sandberg said versus  Mark Zuckerberg versus the CFO.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg saying Instagram has been this amazing success and  highlighting.  And then Sheryl Sandberg comes on and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- everything.  Yes, \"The Lego Movie\", \"everything is awesome\".   And then the CFO comes on.  Leave it to the money guy to be fair  (INAUDIBLE) and go, well, I've got a couple of bombs I'm about to drop on  you,\" 20 minutes into this conference call. .  It's not funny.  It's not  funny.</p><p> But there were a lot of problem areas that the finance chief highlighted.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that certainly is setting the tone for technology this  morning.  Facebook right now down 20 percent.</p><p> And then there's this, Trump talking tariffs.  President Trump off to  Illinois this morning to talk workforce development and tour a steel  factory that's reopened as a result of his tariff regulations.</p><p> Just in the last hour I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who  touted the President's tough stance on steel and aluminum tariffs.  Here's  what he told me this morning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  So steel and aluminum, there's no  intention to abandon those industries.  So the President is very happy with  the progress they have made in opening new facilities.   I'm joining him  today as we go out to visit one that had just recently been reopened.  He's  not going to do anything to destroy steel and aluminum from their new-found  substance.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And yet, it's a double edged sword.  Both Coca-Cola and General  Motors will be raising prices they say on their iconic products in large  part because of the fallout over tariffs.</p><p> Joining me right now is Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz.  He is former deputy  secretary of Defense, former ambassador to Indonesia and former assistant  secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.  Ambassador -- good  to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p> PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be here -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Secretary Ross' notion that the steel and  aluminum tariffs are remaining intact.  The markets rallied hugely last  night on this idea that the E.U. and the U.S. are going to work toward no  tariffs but we know that the aluminum and steel tariffs are still in place.  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  And I think they're hurting some of our best friends including  Japan pretty badly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So your thoughts on this strategy that the President has.  You  know, he comes into this saying ok, we lost $151 billion with the E.U.  We  lost you know, $500 billion with China.  We want a more level playing  field.</p><p> And do you think this is all a negotiation, that at the end of the day  maybe the U.S. comes out in a better place as it seems like the markets are  viewing this?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly hope so because there's no question, we need  a more level playing field.  But we could end up with a very, very rocky  one instead if this escalates.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the President and the European Commission president Mr.  Juncker yesterday came out very positive and discussed that they are going  to have a breakthrough in trade talks to avoid a transatlantic trade war.   The two leaders agreeing to hold off on further tariffs signaling a pause  in the President's auto tariff threat.  Ambassador -- could zero tariffs  with Europe become a reality in your view?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  It will certainly surprise me if it happens but it would be a  good thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is your take in terms of what's happening in terms of a  cease fire when it comes to China?  President Xi issuing a stark threat to  President Trump claiming that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.</p><p> Your reaction to President Xi's comments?  What does yesterday's deal  between the U.S. and Europe mean for China?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  I think it puts more pressure on China.  And the issue with  China is not so much about the tariffs although they're relevant.  But the  real issue with China is the way it's been stealing intellectual property  here, not only by forcing companies to reveal what they have but also by  cyber methods, breaking into corporate secrets.  I think it's a very, very  dangerous trend that they've been on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  And I think it's good to be opposing them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you're glad in terms of the pushback from America to China  in terms of the consistent theft of intellectual property?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  If it doesn't get out of control -- but my sense is from Xi's  comments is he's much more worried about where it could go than we are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> Ambassador, let me move on to the President's bilateral meeting with  Vladimir Putin.  National security adviser John Bolton citing special  counsel Robert Mueller's investigation for a delay issuing this statement.   \"The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President  Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over.  So we've  agreed that it will be after the first of the year.\"</p><p> How do you expect the U.S. policy toward Russia moving forward and any  thoughts on the President's foreign policy decisions?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  You know, one of the ironies here is that Putin has obviously  succeeded in sowing enormous dissension in the United States over our own  political process which is one of his goals.  But he's actually ended up  with a Russia policy that is probably much tougher than he might have had  otherwise and may even get tougher still.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think that -- then, I guess that's a positive in your  view?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Positive that the meeting's postponed?  Absolutely.  But what I  would like to see more talk about is measures like this Magnitsky Act that  put pressure on Russian plutocrats to make it much more difficult for them  to hide their money here and to launder it.</p><p> And the British (INAUDIBLE) something called the unexplained wealth orders  which are now putting a lot of pressure on probably Russians, but maybe  other people as well, who are buying expensive property in London through  offshore shell companies to hide it.  That's a real threat to Putin and his  clique.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  That's why he's apparently going after Bill  Browder, who of course, it was Bill Browder's lawyer Mr. Magnitsky who was  killed in jail and he was able to get the Magnitsky Act.</p><p> Let me ask you about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday testifying in  front of the Senate foreign relations committee facing a barrage of  questions aimed at U.S. policy on Russia and on North Korea.  Pompeo vowed  that the U.S. will not relax sanctions towards Russia but said that we  cannot make progress with Moscow unless we're open to discussions.  Listen  to this clip from yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  President Trump believes the two  great nuclear powers should not have a contentious relationship.  This is  not just in our interest but in the interest of the whole world.</p><p> He strongly believes that now is the time for direct communication in our  relationship in order to make clear to President Putin that there is the  possibility, however remote it might be, to reverse the negative course of  our relationship.  Otherwise, the administration will continue imposing  tough actions against Russia in response to its malign activities.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ambassador, it looked like Mr. Pompeo did well yesterday.   Anything strike you from that testimony?  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly agree with that second part of keeping up the  pressure.</p><p> I mean it's worth noting, Maria, that when President Reagan was negotiating  with the old Soviet Union, he didn't let up the pressure on Poland which  was one of their weak spots.  And even more impressively when he was  working closely with General Secretary Gorbachev to get an arms control  agreement that was very important to everybody he made that famous  statement about \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"  So he kept the  pressure up in Berlin.</p><p> I think the only way you get anywhere with people like Putin is by having  pressure on them.  If you just try to do it by being nice it never works.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Ambassador -- it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.</p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, bitcoin is bouncing back.  The  cryptocurrency jumping above $8,000 for the first time in two months.   What's behind the recent gains -- coming up.</p><p> Then Twitter's shadow ban -- why some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fallout, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Breaking news -- two police officers killed in the line of duty.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWOR CORRESPONDENT:  We're getting some new  details, Maria, on this breaking news.  This happened in Milwaukee.  A 17- year police veteran was shot and killed by a suspect who was wanted on gun  and drug violations.  They do have that suspect in custody now.  A  procession of officers escorted the fallen officer's body to the medical  examiner's office.  Look at these incredible pictures.</p><p> This is the second death of a Milwaukee police officer just this summer.   What a show of support.</p><p> Meanwhile in Arizona, one officer was shot and killed and the other was  injured.  This happened last night there.  The officers responding to a  call about a man driving erratically on the roads.</p><p> Well, New York is keeping its promise to 9/11 victims' families 17 years  later.  Through improved DNA testing the medical examiner's office has  identified the 1,642nd victim of that terror attack.</p><p> Scott Michael Johnson was 26 years old.  He was working for the investment  banking firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.  He was on the 89th floor of the  South Tower.  The bone belonging to Johnson had been tested dozens of times  throughout the years but recent improvements allowed examiners to gain  enough DNA evidence to make that match.  Johnson -- the first victim to be  identified since august of last year.</p><p> Well, Mattel is cutting costs and they're cutting jobs.  The company  slashing 2,200 jobs as they continue to struggle with falling sales after  reporting weak and unexpected quarterly results.  Mattel, which is of  course, well-known for making Barbie and Hot Wheels, also hurt by the  closing of Toys R Us which happened recently this year.  Shares of Mattel,  Maria, are trading lower in the premarket -- ok, a lot lower, down by 11  percent.  There you go.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big move there, cutting 2,200 jobs and the stock takes a hit.</p><p> CASONE:  Which is -- usually it's the opposite we see.  That's not good for  that company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up, bitcoin bouncing back this morning, the cryptocurrency jumping  above 8,000 for the first time in two months.  What's behind that big gain,  coming up. </p><p> Then, no such thing as a free lunch, right.  Why San Francisco is now  looking to ban free cafeterias at technology companies -- one of the best  perks there is.</p><p> Back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Bitcoin optimism is back.  The cryptocurrency reaching over $8,000 a token  for the first time since May.  Ripple chief market strategist Cory Johnson  joins us now to talk more about that.  Cory -- it's great to see you.  </p><p> CORY JOHNSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RIPPLE:  Good to see you too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What do you make of this  recent move higher on bitcoin?  And tell us how you see the overall market?   Because you're really much more bullish on XRP as opposed to bitcoin.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  Well, I think -- I think for us, you know, Ripple has based  some of our software solutions on XRP because we think it's a better  technology.  We look at XRP as sort of block chain 2.0.</p><p> The bitcoin is a fascinating idea but it's really sort of breaking down in  terms of its ability to use it, closing transaction is really slow.  We're  looking at a business problem.  And the business problem is moving money  across borders.</p><p> It is crazy that today I can send a text message to a friend in Rome with  emojis and a gif of falling down and clever stuff and I can send an Excel  spreadsheet by e-mail to South Africa in 3 seconds.  But if I want to move  money from New York to Mexico City it takes five days and costs over 500  basis points.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> JOHNSON:  That's crazy in this era of technology.  So Ripple has created a  bunch of software products to really accelerate that process, to move money  in less than a minute and for, you know, just basis points.  But using XRP  as a basis technology for some of the software solutions we can move it so  much cheaper and so much more efficiently using XRP.  We think that XRP  will have great value over time.  </p><p> BELL:  What about consumers?  Mastercard just applied for a patent to be  able to use cryptocurrencies on credit cards.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> BELL:  Is that the future of currencies?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I mean we are 100 percent focused on business.  I mean I think  that there will be lots of better ways for money to move but again, when  you talk about moving money, bitcoin's slow.  Ether is slow.  XRP moves  really, really fast just because of the way the technology is a little bit  different.</p><p> I don't want to give you the technological details but fundamentally money  should move as fast as ideas move as fast as data moves.  And right now it  doesn't.  And it's really expensive.</p><p> The place that money hurts -- that slow-moving money hurts people is moving  money across borders.  If you are working and your family is in another  country, if you're on vacation in another country, if you're a business and  you want to buy products in another country to sell it where you are, it  takes so long to move money and costs so much money.</p><p> Imagine if your business is selling (ph) with 500 basis points -- the World  Bank says it's a 532-basis point cost to move money across borders for  anyone.  That's a horrible drag on business.  We're trying to fix that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory hurdles and head winds country by  country in terms of are they rising because again, we talk about no borders  in terms of virtual currencies but there are borders and regulators love to  make sure that even in the digital world that those borders exist.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Look, one person's regulation is another person's protection.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> JOHNSON:  I believe it's really important for investors to be protected.   We've seen what happens when there aren't investor protections.  We've seen  investors lose so much money.  And we've seen it in the world of crypto.   We've seen some real bad actors involved.</p><p> So we're thrilled that regulators are getting involved.  It's really  interesting.  It's not what I expected when I joined this company say six  months ago and we're very much engaged in conversations with regulators.</p><p> But I'll say that a lot of other countries are moving faster than the U.S.  to try to provide really clear lanes of where business can act, what's  right and what's wrong.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Like China.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, China's a really peculiar case.  Most of the bitcoin  mining, most of the ether mining is all taking place in places where power  is cheap, which is China; and where they've got the access to the best  computer chips, which is China.  And so China -- most bitcoin is mined in  China.  Most ether is mined in China.</p><p> XRP isn't being mined.  It was pre-mined, if you will.  So as a result it  uses virtually no power when it's, you know, compared to these other  things.  Running a node in the network is so much cheaper as a result.  And  there isn't any mining cost with that.  So it's a different kind of  technology as a result.</p><p> But countries like Singapore, countries like Switzerland, countries like  Thailand are working really hard to make sure that businesses develop there  around block chain.  The U.S. is starting to do some things.  The SEC has  started to try to figure some things out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  But other countries aren't waiting and the entrepreneurs aren't  waiting to start business.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  really exciting opportunity.</p><p> Cory -- thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  It's so good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You, too.  Great to have you -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We've known you a lot of years -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  We're not that old?  Come on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, we're not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you're still innovating.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Go figure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Cory Johnson.</p><p> Coming up, Twitter's shadow ban -- some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fall out coming next.</p><p> And then fighting free lunches -- why two San Francisco lawmakers are  trying to do away with free cafeterias at Silicon Valley technology  companies.  The story coming up.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top stories right now,  07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Facebook unfriended by investors this morning, take a look at the stock,  plummeting better than 20 percent.  The company taking a hit after  reporting disappointing sales and revenue guidance, the conference call had  lots of expectations and they fell short.  </p><p> It is just the tip of the iceberg for technology.  We've got Amazon and  Intel reporting this afternoon, those are the two to watch today.  Amazon  with some high expectations there, going into the quarter down 1-3/4  percent going in to the numbers.  </p><p> Futures this morning, indicating a mix opening.  The Dow Industrials are up  36 points right now but the NASDAQ is down 58 points as technology takes a  hit on the Facebook news.  </p><p> The markets ending the day yesterday higher.  Tensions over trade disputes  between the U.S. and the E.U. ease as the president spoke with the European  Commission President Mr. Juncker and said they are going to work toward an  agreement toward zero tariffs.  Markets rallied on that.  Dow Industrials  finished up 172 points.  The NASDAQ was up 91.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, money is moving into  stocks.  The DAX Index up better than one percent.  No real agreement on  autos and yet the DAX Index in Germany quite strong today, up better than  one percent.  CAC Quarante up quarter of a percent.  The FT-100 unchanged  as the European markets await the European Central Bank news this morning.  </p><p> Asian markets closing mostly in the red overnight.  Take a look, the KOSPI  was up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p> President Trump on Twitter declaring a big day for free and fair trade  after his meeting with the European Commission president.  The president  said that the goal would be zero tariffs.  I spoke with U.S. Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier this morning to get his take.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY, U.S. COMMERCE:  Well, you notice on light trucks,  there was an exception for automotive products.  It said we'd work towards  zero tariffs on nonautomotive industrial products.  Steel and aluminum,  there's no attention to abandon those industries.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Twitter accused of hiding conservative voices in the  search results at the company.  The company taking heat this morning for  so-called \"shadow banning.\"  We will tell you all about it with the details  coming up.  </p><p> Then, local businesses are up in arms in San Francisco over free lunches at  technology companies.  They want to force workers to pay up, leave campus  to get food and pay for it.  The controversy, coming up.  </p><p> We're in the middle of the summer blockbuster season where there are big  movies, there is IMAX.  We are checking in to see surprises the company's  got in store for movie goers.  We'll check in with the IMAX CEO on earnings  and what's ahead.  </p><p> All that coming up, but first, Facebook shares, falling out of bed this  morning, that's for sure.  The stock down 20 percent on news from the  company's earnings report which basically opened up the idea that growth is  slowing down at Facebook as they invest more in security and privacy tools.  </p><p> Joining us right now on the telephone is Arete senior analyst Richard  Kramer.  Richard, great to have you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.   Your reaction to the Facebook news yesterday?  </p><p> RICHARD KRAMER, SENIOR ANALYST, ARETE (via telephone):  Well, I think we  had already had a growth slowdown from extremely high levels in our  numbers.  I don't think that was a big surprise.  The biggest surprise was  that Facebook is extremely happy to continue spending the kind of money it  does, both on cap-ex, on staff growth, on buybacks and so forth.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But -- I mean, when you look at the kind of growth numbers that  we've been accustomed to at Facebook, 30 percent revenue growth, are those  days now in the rear view mirror?  Is that the issue here that we're not  going to see the kind of growth that we expected in the past?  </p><p> KRAMER:  I think you need to put this in the context of the law of large  numbers.  And Facebook ended last year at a $40 billion company.  And  finding an incremental 50 percent growth on top of that, which is the clip  that they were running at last year, is -- you know, finding another $20  billion of advertising revenue and that's just simply a very hard to do.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Richard, Lindsey Bell here.   Interesting, revenue per user was actually up, which I thought was kind of  a highlight, if you could find one.  But the real question we've talked  about all morning is Instagram, this is supposed to be the growth engine  for the company going forward.  How are they going to monetize it?  They've  kind of lagged there.  What do you see going forward with that?  </p><p> KRAMER:  I mean, Instagram is incredibly powerful platform.  And if you  look at brand like, Nike, that has 80 million followers on Instagram, where  else will it be able to tap into a global audience to directly market its  products to?  I wouldn't be overly concerned about that transition.  That's  something that we've written about earlier this year.  I think there's also  another important narrative which is Facebook is desperate to avoid  regulation, by showing -- saying that they're going to invest more and show  lower margins, they're creating a sort of oh, woe is me narrative around  the stock that hopefully will keep for them regulators at day.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Richard, it's Dagen McDowell  on Instagram, it's not the feeds per say and the ad revenue that that pulls  in, it was the ad revenue generated on the Instagram stories because  Facebook has predicted that activity on those stories, those photos and  videos that disappear after 24 hours, would eclipse the time spent just  scrolling through feeds next year.  How can they better monetize the ads  that are -- and activity in Instagram stories.  What do you expect them to  do?  </p><p> KRAMER:  Well, I think what you're -- I think what you're pointing out is  that story's clearly is a new format and they're transitioning to it and  they're willing to take the pain clearly as a company with $42 billion of  cash.  They can absorb quite a bit of that pain.  I think you have to give  them some time.  Because the next thing that will clearly be coming on  Instagram is shoppable icons that -- it will turn into -- rapidly turn into  an e-commerce platform alongside stories.  </p><p> So, there's a lot of directions they can take Instagram.  The focus right  now is on this transition to stories.  But that overlooks a whole range of  other options that they have with the platform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Would you buy the stock right here at 173 and change?  </p><p> KRAMER:  Well, we're obviously not supposed to talk about our ratings on  the air but we are -- we have a -- we have a positive view on the stock.  I  don't think that -- I don't think Facebook's days are completely over  because they're planning to spend more money.  I think if you look out  three, five years, and ask yourself will the platforms that they have still  be as relevant?  It's main Facebook may not be as relevant but Instagram  may be a lot more relevant.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Richard, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining the conversation this morning.  </p><p> KRAMER:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Richard Kramer joining us.  </p><p> Turning now to Twitter being under fire.  The social media company facing  backlash for reportedly restricting the visibility of top Republicans, but  not Democrats, in its search results.  The technique is called shadow  banning.  And according to the Vice News, people like RNC Chair Ronna  McDaniel do not appear in Twitter's auto populated dropdown search box on  the site.  </p><p> McDaniel twitted about it yesterday writing this, the notion that social  media companies could suppress certain political points of view should  concern every American.  Twitter owns the public -- owes the public answers  to what's really going on.  </p><p> Joining us right now is Caldwell Strategic Consulting founder and Fox News  political analyst Gianno Caldwell.  Gianno, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  What do you think is going on?  </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this, Gianno?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  Well, I mean, this comes as no surprise to me and many other  conservatives.  You think about what happened with Diamond and Silk with  (INAUDIBLE) members of congress being impacted by Facebook and other social  media networks who don't like the political speech of conservatives, it's  fairly problematic.  We've seen hearings on this on Capitol Hill.  I think  that it's now time for members of congress to take a deeper look and begin  to put regulations on these companies that do this, that really try to  interfere with the equitable actions of every American.  </p><p> So, whereas as you can be Louis Farrakhan and not be shadow banned or  impacted in any way, who obviously uses forms of hate speech or you can be  Madonna and threaten the president of the United States in ways.  These  individuals still have a social media presence that's glowing for their  viewers.  </p><p> So, why is it that conservatives who talk about being pro life, who talk  about other capitalism, why is it that they're being shadow banned?  This  is problematic on many levels and it's something that congress must take a  deeper look, a heightened look, I think.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know when we had Kevin McCarthy on and other Republican  congressmen, they all said that -- you know, you don't want necessarily the  government to come in and start being big government on companies, right?   I don't think anybody wants that because we are in a free market.  What you  would like to see is competition come in and we'll see if this leads to  that.  Because, obviously, there's an issue here.  If Twitter is going to  censor conservative ideas.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One issue is -- and that's why Facebook is spending so much  money on privacy, that's why they're dedicating themselves to improving the  protections on the platform.  And they've been accused of censor --  obviously, censoring conservative content as well.  </p><p> But that's -- but they understand the danger of regulation.  Or they're  beginning to understand that.  </p><p> But in terms of the problem that you expressed with Ronna McDaniel, it's  still apparent, like this is something that Twitter could fix in  spontaneously.  If you put the name Ronna in the search, Ronna's got a  verified Twitter account.  But instead, the first results, if you put Ronna  in, you get somebody who has a verified account with a few thousand  followers, not 85,000 like Ronna McDaniel.  You get somebody with a  verified account with a few hundred.  </p><p> And by the way, I follow a lot of conservatives on Twitter and they follow  me back but they're not giving me that search result.  That's something  that Twitter could easily fix and so far they haven't done it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, they haven't.  </p><p> JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  So, Gianno, this is Jack Brewer.  What  can influencers do, conservative minded influencers, what can we do to  really push forward this messaging?  Because at the end of the day, these  social media companies are dependent upon influencers.  That's where people  are going, that's who they're following.  And so, you know, I'm just trying  to figure out, come up with an idea on what steps we can take to make our  voices bigger?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  You know, interestingly enough, I think especially when it comes  to the shadow banning issue, there's been a lot of folks that have spoken  up.  That's the reason why we had those big hearings on Capitol Hill.  You  saw Diamond and Silk actually on Capitol Hill in a hearing where we had  this discussion.  Many of these social media companies have said that they  were taking steps to correct this.  But you continue to see the same issue  pop up time and time again.  </p><p> When we have the president of the United States who's a -- the biggest  government leader using this service.  And we know that there's other  government leaders who've been shadow banned as well, members of congress,  that's when it's necessities.</p><p> In my view, of course, we don't like regulation, competition is great, but  this is something that the government is fully using.  This is a -- this is  a spear where public dialogue is happening on a regular basis.  So yes,  it's great to have competition but it will take a while before competition  is able to compete with that kind of search profile, these social media  sites.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CALDWELL:  So, yes, this is the time I think that we should be going in and  talking about listen, if you're not going to correct this, you made claims  time and time again, there should be some form of a penalty because there's  voices that are seriously being silenced.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just really quick, Jack Dorsey has been meeting privately a lot  of conservative thought leaders and having a lot of discussions.  But that  talk needs to turn into a walk in terms of the policies and the way that  Twitter is actually managed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it hasn't.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It has not.  Gianno, good to get your insight.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> CALDWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Gianno Caldwell there.</p><p> Coming up, no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, why San Francisco  is now looking to ban free lavish cafeterias at technology companies, one  of the best perks for tech workers, that story coming up.  </p><p> Then, pump up the volume.  We are going deeper into the ultimate high  quality movie going experience with the CEO of IMAX, coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A move to ban free lunches at technology company  cafeterias in an attempt to support local restaurants.  Gerri Willis with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right.  If you are one of the thousands of San Francisco workers used to  enjoying a free lunch every day at work, get ready for a change.  The  city's Board of Supervisors wants to ban the free lunch, saying it hurts  local restaurants.  Look, even the restaurants say they can't compete.  </p><p> Free lunches are a perk at big tech companies and offered by the likes of  Google, Twitter, but also Levi Strauss.  That's an old one.  There are 51  such employee cafeterias in San Francisco.  One supporter of the law  banning in house cafeterias said this \"We don't want employees biking or  driving to their office, staying there all day and going home.  This is  about getting people out of their office.\"</p><p> However, if the law is passive and only applied a new companies putting a  cafeteria is not existing once.  Well, the proposals in usual, it's not  without president.  Nearby Mountain View, California barred Facebook from  subsidizing on-site meals for 2,000 workers for the tech company offices.   Says one San Francisco restaurant to -- restaurant tour that it's hard to  compete with free.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what?  I mean, companies are allowed to offer their  employees whatever they want.  I mean, this is basically to me big  government telling companies how to do their business.  </p><p> WILLIS:  Or just mouthy small government, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIS:  It's a board of supervisors here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, a board of supervisors.  Local city supervisors telling  technology companies how to pay their employees.  That's a perk that  companies have a right to give.  </p><p> BREWER:  And what about the food service companies, right?  They're most  the -- most of them are outsourcing us.  So you have you know, major food  service companies now that are going to be losing contracts and it makes no  sense.  Another thing, why don't they just charge them a quarter, come eat  a full meal, a quarter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's good.  Then the local restaurants will have to  compete with that.  </p><p> BREWER:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why, I can't figure out why some of these companies haven't  moved to more free market cities?  I know that all the talent is in Silicon  Valley and in San Francisco.  </p><p> WILLIS:  Well, they have moved south, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And some of them have moved to Texas which is a no income tax  state, maybe even -- I know, I think Zappos is based in Las Vegas, of all  places.  But that's owned by Amazon.  </p><p> But I'll point out, again, it's because these bureaucrats think they know  better --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- than people who have created some of the greatest companies  in the history of America.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why they're getting the (INAUDIBLE) that they're  getting.  Because they got all these perks.  So what?  They're allowed.  </p><p> WILLIS:  What if you're an employee of one of these companies and city hall  saying we're going to take this away from you.  I would really be pissed.   Is this really going to help them?  I don't think so.  This is exactly like  the big debate three years ago over busses, Google busses.  Local groups  complained hey, this is texploitation.  They're there ganking up major  arteries in the city. </p><p> By the way, it was free to the city to transport Google employees.  They  didn't have to pay for city busses --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> WILLIS:  -- to get people anywhere.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  I think we all agree.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Listen, I lived in San Francisco --</p><p> BELL:  Keep out of the business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- for less than a year and I hated it for that very reason.  </p><p> WILLIS:  We were there at the same time.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, we we're there at the same --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  City officials -- City officials trying to tell businesses how  to run their businesses.  Gerri, thank you.  </p><p> WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Speaking of technology, President Trump is just tweeting this,  he says this, Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.  </p><p> Yes, we were just talking about this, obviously.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, blockbusters on the big, big screen.</p><p> I'm talking to the CEO of IMAX next hour about his company's high quality  theater experience and summer movie going surprises.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a clip, that was a clip from \"Mission: Impossible- Fallout\".  The sixth installment of the wildly successful franchise of  \"Mission Impossible\".  The Tom Cruise led blockbuster is the latest IMAX  offering.  It hit screens nationwide tomorrow -- tonight.  </p><p> IMAX meanwhile, reporting second quarter earnings last night in earnings  per share $00.30 on 98.3 million revenue.  EPS beating expectations with  revenue narrowly missing expectations.  </p><p> Joining us right now is the CEO of IMAX, Richard Gelfond.  Richard, it's  great to see you.  </p><p> RICHARD GELFOND, CEO, IMAX:  Great to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> GELFOND:  I'm happy to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good quarter.  </p><p> GELFOND:  Very good quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What drove the quarter?  </p><p> GELFOND:  Well, first of all, the second quarter was the highest box office  quarter in the history of the movie business.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> GELFOND:  Somewhat surprising, people think it's somewhat stagnant industry  but it's actually still growing.  And IMAX's case, what we do is global  blockbusters.  So, a large majority of our revenues were international.  We  did over $100 million in China in box office, over $100 million  domestically and over $100 million in the rest of the world.  We were  firing on all cylinders.  I think the public has an appetite for these  blockbusters in a premium way and that's where IMAX's fits.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's really important information that you're giving us.   Because the international story is such an important growth story for so  many companies, IMAX included.  You haven't been caught up in this tariff  fight with China.  </p><p> GELFOND:  No, we haven't.  You know, I don't think we will either.  And  some of the reasons for that, Maria, are it's been a very good relationship  between Hollywood and China.  So Hollywood's made a lot of money exporting  its films to China.  We have a separate public company in China that's  worth over $1 billion, a big business.  We do a big part of the Chinese box  office.  And for the Chinese, they're portrayed in a different way than  they were years ago.  </p><p> So, they're not the bad guys anymore and they're not -- you know, the  communist enemies.  They're portrayed, you look at movies like \"The  Martian\" or you look at movies like \"The Great Wall\", in a very favorable  way.  So, I don't think China wants to poke an eye at Hollywood right now.   I don't think that works.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did you have to give up any of your technology, did you have to  give up any of the secrets of IMAX in order to get your company -- you  know, in a foothold in China?  </p><p> GELFOND:  We didn't.  And we didn't -- initially, we didn't grow with  Chinese partners.  We did it ourselves.  On the other hand though, we had  an ugly episode about seven or eight years ago where someone, a former  employee stole some of our technology and they were backed by the Chinese  government.  And it was drawn out.  </p><p> So, you know, I think the government has something there when they talk  about protecting the theft of I.P.  And I think China's a real world power  now.  They're not a disrupter.  They're the status quo.  They have more  engineers than anyone graduating in the world.  And I think they have to be  part of the world community and protect I.P.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The best part of IMAX is the experience.  That's why you're  seeing the growth you are in Saudi Arabia.  In China you're looking at  building and expanding, throughout the Middle East.  </p><p> Tell us what's on top in terms of the big movies and also what you're  expecting in terms of the Middle East and where the growth comes from next.  </p><p> GELFOND:  Well, Saudi Arabia is a promising market.  It just opened up to  cinema a few months ago.  And we are the second theater -- commercial  theater ever in Saudi Arabia with Vox, AMC opened the first commercial  theater there.  India's a very big growth market for us now.  We have -- I  think, 35 theaters in the Middle East today.  They love the Western movies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, fantastic.  </p><p> GELFOND:  \"Black Panther\" played amazing in the Middle East.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That did very well.  And I know you have \"Aqua Man\" coming up,  you've got the Fantastics.  </p><p> GELFOND:  \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Ant-Man\".</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Richard, you're going to be our special guest this weekend in  Wall Street.  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  Richard -- </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  July 26th. END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  Facebook unfriended on Wall Street.  Take a look  at the stock plunging on disappointing sales and revenue guidance.  Nearly  $150 billion wiped out of market value in the after-hours trading session  for Facebook. </p><p> The stock is down better than 20 percent right now.  That sell-off setting  the tone for the rest of the technology sector.  The biggest names in tech  under pressure this morning.  Amazon will report after the close going into  the numbers.  The stock is down 1-1/4 percent.  Twitter and Snap both down  better than three percent.  Broader markets this morning mixed.  Take a  look at futures indicating a gain to the Dow, but a loss for the NASDAQ.   Dow Industrials up 44 points right now. </p><p> S&amp;P 500 is down five and the NASDAQ down 52 points.  That's by the way is  off of the lows of the morning down three quarters of a percent on NASDAQ.   It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday in the final 30 minutes of  trading.  We had a huge surge on reports of a softening trade dispute  between the U.S. and the E.U.  President Trump and European Commission  President Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to  negotiate a trade deal. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The European Union is going  to start almost immediately to buy a lot of soybeans.  They're a tremendous  market buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers.  These will open markets for  farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in  both the United States and the European Union. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are taking a look at the key issues at stake this morning  coming up.  Checking global markets this morning, Europe is mixed.  The  European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged.  That was expected.   But investors are waiting on ECB President Mario DraghI's news conference  that happens later this hour.  We are looking for guidance on rising rates  and the end of stimulus there.  CAC Quarante is up a quarter of a percent. </p><p> DAX Index in German up one and a quarter percent this morning.  In Asia  overnight, markets are mostly lower.  As you can see there, China was the  weakest.  The Shanghai Composite down three quarters of a percent.  And  explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  The only person injured was  the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We have the very latest on  that investigation coming up.  And Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones standing firm  in his support for the national anthem. </p><p> He says all players will be required to stand.  Plus, the end of an era.   The new owner of Necco Wafers shutting down a factory.  What it means for  your candy favorites coming up.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, former NFL star and The Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer, and CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  A really big show today guys with lot  of news.  Good morning. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  A lot of news and it looks like  I've been just walking the bottom of the screen.  A lot of earnings coming  out of beatings, so I like that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  McDonald's the latest beating earnings estimates in terms of  earnings and revenue. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the news out of the White  House with meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker from Europe was certainly a  relief to investors.  You saw what the market did yesterday.  It's a de- escalation of the trade fight at least starting with Europe, an important  trading partner, a tariff truce, maybe no new tariffs say on automobiles.   That will be good news.  But, again, I think it goes to Steve Forbes'  point.  You saw the market reaction.  If we weren't having this trade fight  in some way, the market would be higher than it is already. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.  And last night, you know, we know that the  steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place, but they've agreed that  there won't be additional tariffs right now. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  While they work out a broader trade deal that Europe also  agreeing to buy more soybeans that will help offset at least some of the  pain from that fight that we've got into that we've entered into with  China.  And also it looks like natural gas.  Again, you -- that goes a huge  way to offsetting the power that Russia is trying to claim. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And right now they have an outline of all this going.  They're  going to turn this into an agreement apparently.  Joining the conversation  this morning Energy Secretary Rick Perry is joining us today to talk about  that in terms of what kind of business can be done between the E.U. and  America when it comes to energy, South Dakota Congresswoman Kristi Noem is  with us this morning, along with Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star Pitcher, Ross  Stripling is here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney weighs in  as well. </p><p> Big show ahead.  Don't miss it.  And we kick it off right here with this  top story.  And Facebook slide bringing down all the big technology names  this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange looking at the market that is watching tick slow down, Nic. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Absolutely.  Good morning,  Maria.  So when we're watching Facebook dragging down all the tech stocks  dragging down ETF's and while we see the Dow up more than 40 points.  Good  news on tariffs talk.  But ultimately, this is going to weigh.  Let's break  this down.  So when you talk about what you saw in Facebook and when I was  talking to the analyst this morning, Joe Collina, over at Wedbush. </p><p> You see it's down 20 percent, OK.  This basically takes Facebook from  record territory yesterday into bear market territory, and missed on  everything, revenues, daily active users, monthly active users, cash on  operations, advertising guidance, and guidance.  OK.  With that what really  wild Wall Street in a negative way.  It was first (INAUDIBLE) Sandberg and  then the CFO David Winger comes on, and basically gives the outlook.  And  what really led Joe Collina to be really surprised is that he feels that  there are serious credibility issues with this management lying to  investors. </p><p> We were told there would be no impact from privacy.  And in fact, that is  not the case.  In fact, you heard from David Weiner saying that the outlook  would fall significantly and he said that the outlook is somewhat severe.   There are others who are still positive in rating the stock just fine.  But  this is a sell-off and it will drag all the other social media and ETFs  down along with it.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hi, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides looking into  market that will opening mixed this morning.  In just about an hour,  President Trump will leave to talk workforce optimism in the Midwest.  This  as some U.S. companies say that the steel and aluminum tariffs will hurt  more than they will help.  Earlier, I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross.  Here's what he said. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The impact of steel and  aluminum on the auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about  one percent on the cost of the vehicle.  So to the degree that that might  be passed along, that's possible. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Blake Burman is live at the White House with the very latest.   Here and, Blake, what a reaction to the president's press conference with  Mr. Juncker yesterday? </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  And we  all hear from the president later today, Maria, as he is set to leave the  White House here later this hour.  He's on the road two stops today, Iowa  and to Illinois, and it is at that second stop where the president will  indeed give a speech on trade and, of course, comes one day after the  president hosted the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude  Juncker here at the White House for two and a half hours. </p><p> That meeting culminated with an impromptu semi-press conference I guess you  could say in the Rose Garden yesterday in which those two essentially said  that they are going to try to avert a trade war.  The E.U. says it will buy  more soybeans from the U.S. for example while the president suggested that  he is willing to back off steel and aluminum tariffs for the E.U. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  We also will resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues and we  will resolve retaliatory tariffs.  We have some tariffs that are  retaliatory and that will get resolve this part of what we're doing. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Now, companies as you know are citing the steel and aluminum  tariffs as a major headwind.  Yesterday alone for example, Coca-Cola  announced that it will raise prices in North America while G.M., Ford, and  Fiat Chrysler all lowered profit forecasts for the year all citing tariffs.   Now, just before the president and Jean-Claude Juncker met here at the  White House to try to lower the volume if nothing else on this back-and- forth emerging trade tit-for-tat. </p><p> The Chinese President Xi Jinping weighed in a speech yesterday.  This was  his warning.  He said, \"A trade war should be rejected because there will  be no winner.\"  Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us now to talk more about that is South Dakota  Congresswoman Kristi Noem, a member of the House on Ways and Means  Committee who attended a trade meeting with the president yesterday at the  White House.  Congresswoman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us. </p><p> REP. KRISTI NOEM (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Thank you for having me on today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what we have from the European leader and  President Trump in terms of this agreement.  They're calling it an outline,  not an out-and-out agreement. </p><p> NOEM:  Well, it was a good day yesterday and a great announcement for the  farmers in South Dakota, the farmers across this country that Europe is  going to immediately begin buying soybeans which is a new market for us  that has opened up that we can get more of a -- of a market to sell across  the globe.  So I think that is a good indication of what can happen as we  continue to talk to other countries.  This president has been aggressive  and making sure that we have more fair agreements, and bringing people to  the table to make sure that it is beneficial not only for farmers and  ranchers. </p><p> But for all of those involved in industries that have been struggling, and  from decades of unfair treatment. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But just to be clear, the aluminum and steel tariffs are still  in place and it is impacting the growth story and the number of  corporations. </p><p> NOEM:  It is.  You know, we certainly saw a lot of growth and we still  continue to see growth.  In fact, I think we'll have good numbers tomorrow  when they're released.  But, you know, these tariffs have brought people to  the table.  We have had years of unfair treatment.  I think that the  president is keeping his eye on the ball by making sure that he's breaking  down those barriers and getting people to give us better treatment across  the globe. </p><p> And, you know, he said yesterday to us clearly in the -- in the cabinet  room that he doesn't like tariffs.  But he's going to use them to make sure  that we're treated fairly in the future. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, who's next?  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  Who's next  in terms of because again this is still a deal in Europe that has to be  worked out with the more than two dozen nations across the whole of Europe  and in Germany and France have very different goals in terms of trade with  the United States, who's next?  Will it be Mexico?  Will it be a bilateral  deal, a full reworking of NAFTA?  And how soon will we see that? </p><p> NOEM:  You know, I spent a lot of time working on trade since I've been in  Congress and we've had great briefings the last couple of weeks with the  trade ambassador, with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue who's been aggressive in  recognizing how our farmers and ranchers need to get through this difficult  time.  We've had great discussions with the White House.  I think that  these agreements will start to come more rapidly now, now that we've seen  European come and give us a better playing field and give us another market  for soybeans that Mexico could be next. </p><p> When Mexico comes to an agreement with us in the next 30 to 60 days which  is what I'm hoping for.  That brings Canada in with better faith, efforts  than what they've demonstrated so far, so the news is positive.  And we're  going the right direction and that's what I've appreciated is this  president is by far our best negotiator that we've seen in decades.  He has  recognized the problem and the reason that farmers and ranchers are in a  tough situation today is because we've been living through four to five  years of record low commodity prices because previous administration didn't  care to have this fight. </p><p> This president is wanting to break down those barriers and get fair  agreements for us, open up new markets for our farmer and ranchers and  that's what's he's doing through all of these negotiation tactics. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined this morning and said  tariffs are starting to have effect on China in fact.  Here's what he said. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSS:  You see these repeated announcements coming out of China things that  they're doing with the banking system, bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.  Clearly they're feeling pressure from the tariffs that the  president has put on. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of pressure there, congresswoman.  But is it  going to be enough to actually change China's behavior, the thief of  intellectual property, the forced transfer of technology?  </p><p> NOEM:  I believe it will.  We've seen that when they have come back against  us by us forcing them to have more open-handed discussions with us, they  have come back in very politically motivated ways to try to punish our  farmer and ranchers.  They have been targeted in how they've gone after the  United States, and that shows that they recognize how important this fight  is, and how unfair they've been to us for decades.  So this president has  gone to bat for business and businesses and people and families across the  country by giving us tax reform, by giving us relief from regulations that  we're burdening our economy. </p><p> Now, he's fighting for more markets and more fair agreements.  This is  something that we need to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that we're  bringing people to the table, and making China give us a better open  agreement than what we've had in the past.  The trade deficit we've had  with China has been unacceptable for a long time and this president  recognizes that it needs to be rectified. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the other deficit that we talked about, a trillion  dollar deficits.  I know you're working on tax cuts 2.0 there in the House  Ways and Means Committee, what's your timeline there?  And do you worry  that paying for it is going to be a challenge? </p><p> NOEM:  You know, we're seeing growth in the economy which is exactly what  we knew we would see from tax reform.  That's why we're pursuing tax reform  2.0 to give permanence to individual rates, to continue to incentivized  families, to be successful into the future.  So we know what effects have  been already from the first step that we've taken to have 2.0 happen right  now will continue to grow this economy, give more people money in their  pockets, so they can be successful, and then help our treasury as well  continue to recovery by growth and businesses in revenues. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much. </p><p> NOEM:  Thank you for having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Kristi Noem joining us there.  Coming up, a blast  in Beijing.  The latest developments after a man detonates an explosive  device right outside of the U.S. Embassy.  The Jerry Jones standing up for  the national anthem.  The details as the Cowboys owner is bowing his team  will be required to stand during the anthem.  Back in the moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tech under pressure as Facebook is selling off 20 percent right  now.  McDonald's also reporting earnings this morning.  Cheryl Casone with  all the details there, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  How did breakfast do at  McDonald's, right, Maria?  Another stock to watch to your point.  They  reported better than expected results for their second quarter.  Same-store  sales in the U.S rising 2.6 percent global same-store sales climbing four  percent, all of that beating analyst forecasts thanks to the company's  popular value menu and, of course, breakfast.  Still having breakfast at  McDonald's. </p><p> Shares of McDonald's though, they are under precious at the premarket  slightly down about a quarter of a percent, so that's one name to watch  today.  We're also looking at Allergan set to open higher after results  beat the street.  The company announcing a new two billion dollar stock  buyback program.  The stock is trading higher ahead of the opening bell.   As you can see almost two percent.  American Airlines parent out with mixed  earnings. </p><p> Right now, earnings per share beat the street's estimate, but revenue fell  short of expectation.  That might be due to higher oil prices by the way.   American also cutting capacity guidance for the third and the fourth  quarters.  Capacity very important to airline analyst.  Shares of American  are lower in the premarket down about three-quarters of a percent.  Now,  the headline we're following this morning for you, a bomb exploding near  the U.S. Embassy in Beijing overnight. </p><p> Police there say the blast injured the 26-year-old man who was holding the  device.  It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is  from Mongolia.  His motive remains completely unclear.  The U.S. Embassy  was not damaged and thankfully, no one else was hurt.  Well, Nielsen CEO  Mitch Barns is retiring at the end of the year.  Barns became CEO of the  data analytics firm back in 2014.  Companies work plan to start a search  for a new CEO immediately.  Shares of Nielsen sharply lower actually in the  premarket right now on the news down 20 percent, so that's another stock to  watch today.  </p><p> Then finally, there is this.  Oh, boy.  You know those really popular  Valentine's Day candy hearts that we get.  Those.  Well, they could be in  jeopardy.  Necco that makes them has unexpectedly shut down operations at  its Massachusetts plant and they haven't even said if candy production is  going to continue at all. </p><p> Nearly 230 workers were shocked to hear the news.  They were told when to  pick up their final paycheck.  Necco was purchased by an investment company  for $17.3 million dollars at a bankruptcy auction in May and says it has  now sold the company to another buyer, so that buyer is watching.  Please  keep our candy hearts.  Necco knowingly a confectionary company is the  country's oldest continuously operating candy company, so some history  there as well, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Feel that sugar. </p><p> CASONE:  I love it.  Wow.  The video backup makes me smile. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) we think about the workers too.  We think about job  losses.  Wait.  That's not lost on us.  We came from hardworking stock of  small business owners, and so that's why when we talk about tariffs, I get  so passionate about it because I know that there are negative consequences  for some American workers and small business owners.  So, again, there's  balance.  That's what we aim for. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  When we come back, tracking a missing  college student's digital footprint, how Fitbit and Snapchat could help  with the search coming up.  Then, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowing his team  will stand for the national anthem.  Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star pitcher  Ross Stripling is here weighing in.  Plus, he's a stockbroker.  Back in a  minute. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From baseball to business, my next guest is an  all-star pitcher for the L.A. Dodgers who is also happens to be a licensed  stockbroker.  Joining us right now is Ross Stripling.  Ross, great to see  you.  Thanks for joining us. </p><p> ROSS STRIPLING, PITCHER, LOS ANGELES DODGERS:  Hey, guys.  Thanks for  having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we have a lot of questions for you from baseball to  business.  What -- first off, what made you decide to become a stockbroker? </p><p> STRIPLING:  Right.  You know, just took at an interest at a young age,  studied it in college, and when I got drafted, you get a sign bonus from  the Los Angeles Dodgers.  And remember asking my dad, I was like, you know,  I need to get in with your -- with your money guys.  I mean figure out  where to -- where to put this money and he was like, well, I don't know.   It's a good opportunity for you to learn how to do it yourself and ended up  investing my own signing bonus by myself and just kind of fell in love with  the market. </p><p> And as I was going up through the minor leagues, I had a Tommy John surgery  which forced me in this 14 months of my baseball career, and from there  just kind of didn't know if baseball is going to be my future, so I tried  to find something to fall back on and that's when I got in with B. Riley  who sponsored me to take my serious step and my 66, and became a licensed  stockbroker.  And that's, you know, how I kind of got here today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, good for you.  That's terrific.  We've got Jack Brewer on  the -- on the set today with us from the NFL.  And, you know, we've talked  about in the past how athletes make a lot of money and then they lose it  because they don't know how to apply it.  They don't know to save and grow  it, Jack. </p><p> JACK BREWER, FOUNDER, THE BREWER GROUP COMPANIES:  Yes.  Well, Ross set an  example, you know, Ross, I grew up in your neighboring Grapevine, Texas.  I  went to Grapevine High School.  I know you went to Southlake, so I had to  put that out there.  But as, you know, two Texas boys that -- it's a --  it's really good to see what you're doing.  You know, I had a similar story  man playing in the National Football League and I got hurt for the sixth  time. </p><p> Actually, sixth surgery and I went and got my broker's licensed, so I mean  I applaud you and your effort.  You're only 28 years old.  Tell me a little  bit.  How is it the response have been from your teammates?  Are you able  to take, you know, your example and really show other players that you  played with or other guys that may be in the league?  How have they  responded? </p><p> STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I think that's originally one of the main  reasons why I wanted to do it is, you know, like you said, around a lot of  guys that make a lot of money and they may not necessarily understand it.   It's a very complicated subject and, you know, there's a lot of moving  parts and then I wanted to be able to help in the locker room when guys had  questions about certain things where their money is, why it might be there  that, you know, maybe they're not comfortable asking their broker for  whatever reason or they just don't have time, and I'm much more convenient. </p><p> I'm right there.  And the response has been great.  Guys seems like I get a  question or two every day from different guys asking about just a wide  array of things from municipal bonds to the equities that they're in and  all sorts of stuff.  So that's the most -- one of the most fun things for  me -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- what would you do with Facebook this morning? </p><p> STRIPLING:  Man, yes.  That's going to be ugly opening, huh?  That's going  to be down like below 170, so I don't know.  I'm certainly going to be  watching it and I don't -- I haven't had a good chance to buy Facebook like  that in a while down to 170, so we'll see. </p><p> BELL:  Hey, Ross, it's Lindsey Bell.  I'm just wondering, you know, what  has been your best stock pick to date and what do you think about the  markets where we're out here, you know, we're kind of getting along into  the tooth in this bull market? </p><p> STRIPLING:  Right.  Well you know, the last time I did something like this,  I used an individual name and I got a bunch of trouble, so I'm going to --  I'm going to stay away from using an individual name.  But I'm extremely  bullish.  I'm always bullish.  It's just not in my nature to be bearish and  root for anything to go down unless they're playing football against my  aggies I guess.  But, you know, obviously, there's some good things going  on with the union, European Union right now, decrease in tariffs. </p><p> It looks like maybe getting rid of that trade war a little bit, so in the  short-term definitely some good things that Trump is doing in my opinion.   And but for me, I'm always bullish, always looking for stuff in the long  run, always looking for kind of some small and midcap disrupters in the  tech industry, or kind of what I'm looking for the most part, and just  things that I believe in, you know, moving forward in the long run that are  going to be around for a long time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So you like the stock market.  What about this  controversial national anthem protest story?  Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones  says that he's going to require his team to stand during the national  anthem.  This hasn't been an issue for the MLB we know.  But what do you  make of the environment right now? </p><p> STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I'm certainly glad that hasn't made its way to  the MLB like you said.  You know, that's obviously been a very  controversial thing and something that I'm glad that we haven't had to take  much part in.  But, you know, as a Cowboys fan, I respect Jerry Jones  taking the initiative and wanting guys to stand up for the anthem.   Obviously, I understand where guys are coming from when they protest and,  you know, like I said, glad that baseball is kind of been able to stay away  from it.   But, you know, look, look forward to seeing guys stand for the national  anthem, obviously, that might be continuing thing moving forward.  But we  'll see how it goes. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Ross, good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much. </p><p> STRIPLING:  Cash. Thank you, guys.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us there.  Comuing up, Energy Secretary  Rick Perry will join me.  He'll weigh in on trade, tariffs, energy,  business with the E.U., and a lot more.  Plus, a new take on smart  clothing, how Tommy Hilfiger will reward customers for wearing its  merchandise, coming up. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the east coast.  The Bears taking a  swipe at Facebook in the premarket this morning.  The social media giant  getting hammered, down 20 percent right now, after reporting disappointing  sales and revenue guidance, $150 billion in market value wiped out in the  extended hours last night after the company's conference call on earnings.</p><p> More technology stocks reporting today, Amazon and Intel, reporting this  afternoon, Amazon right after the closing bell.  That's going to be one to  watch today.  Down 1-1/3 percent going into those numbers.  We are an hour  away from the opening bell this morning, and Futures are indicating a mixed  start to trading.  We're just getting the durable goods number out.  The  durable goods report just hitting the wire coming in well below analysts'  expectations, durable goods up one percent last month, versus an estimate  of three percent, not a major reaction, though, from markets, NASDAQ still  down 50 points, that's largely on weakness in tech on the heels of  Facebook, Dow Industrials up 43 points.  Off of the highs but nonetheless  showing a gain on the Dow.</p><p> In Europe, this morning, we heard from the European Central Bank which left  interest rates unchanged.  The DAX Index in Germany up 1-1/3 percent, it's  been strong all morning on a -- on a deal with the E.U., and the U.S.  The  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent, the FT-100 in London  flat.  The Asian markets closed mostly in the red overnight with the  exception of Korea, that was up three-quarters of one percent.  </p><p> The end of tariffs troubles on the horizon, president trump detailing his  plan with the European Commission President after yesterday's meeting.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  This is why we agreed today, first of all, to work together towards  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto  industrial goods.  We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade  and services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as  soybeans.  Soybeans is a big deal!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President calling it a big day for free and fair trade.   Meanwhile, Snapchat (INAUDIBLE) investigators are turning to Snapchat and  Fitbit to help in a search for a college student missing since July 18th.   Authorities are hoping the data can help them pinpoint her location.  Big  Tommy is watching you, apparently, Tommy Hilfiger, taking their rewards  program to the 21st century.  The company's new line features smart chip  technology in the clothes, gives you points every time you wear their  clothes, I guess they're tracking you as well.  </p><p> Poor Paul, House Speaker Paul Ryan taking a page from Jimmy Kimmel's book  reading some mean tweets about himself.  And they don't pull any punches.   We'll have that for you also, coming up.  Right now, though, America  charges forward with energy production.  The United States looks to secure  its place as the world's leading producer of oil and natural gas.  The  first natural gas liquification facility on the east coast is being  dedicated today.  It comes less than a day after the President strikes a  major energy deal with the European Union.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas, LNG,  from the United States, and they're going to be a very, very big buyer, so  they'll be able to diversify their energy supply which they want very much  to do, and we have plenty of it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now, with an exclusive look at the new  facility is Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  You're welcome, Maria.   It's a beautiful place out here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you are leading the dedication of this new plant today.   How important is the new plant to this trade deal and easing trade tensions  with the E.U.?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, obviously, this is one of a total of six.  We've got two that  are up and running right now, four that are in some part of being completed  and ready to be selling U.S. LNG across the world.  But this is a fabulous  opportunity to send a message.  I was in Belgium about two weeks ago  talking to my counterparts in the E.U., as I'd also talked to some folks  from other parts of the world as well.  But they know that we have this  extraordinary supply.  What's happened in the energy secretary is  phenomenal, from the standpoint of production or liquefied natural gas, and  it has multiple impacts, obviously, for national security in America.  </p><p> The idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply but  also to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for  the E.U. President yesterday, this isn't just about an economic thing for  the United States, it's about the supply and the security of our allies in  the European theater.  They don't have to sit there and be held hostage  with just one supply of gas.  The United States where there's going to be  going into Poland, where there's going to be coming in to the southern part  of the European Union.  They can rest assured that the United States is  going to be there, be a supplier with no strings attached of liquefied  natural gas.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what kind of a deal are we talking about?  I mean, because  I know that the President pushed back at the NATO meeting just a couple  weeks ago, basically said look, we're protecting you from Russia and you're  buying your gas from Russia.  So, is this -- is he going to take some of  that market share?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, absolutely.  That's what we intend to do.  The Nord Stream II  and the Turkish Stream which coming in from the south.  Neither one of  those are commercially viable.  They're there so that Russia can be the  sole supplier of energy for the European Union.  The vast majority of the  E.U. understands that, and they're not for those two lines as well.   Germany is, I think Austria has a tendencies to be for it as well because  they've got a company that is going to help construct it, but the final  decision-making process, I think the Europeans recognize fully that the  United States is a supplier of LNG, that they want to have, and it does a  multitude of things, not only does it give them some security from a  national security standpoint, it also will have a massive positive impact  upon the environment.  </p><p> We've seen that right here in the United States with over the last decade,  14 percent decrease in our carbon emissions, and that's what the Europeans  are really focused on as well.  So, they can two things that are really  good for them, national security, and helping their environment, and the  United States and our LNG is going to be a major player with that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about Dominion Energy Cove Point LNG.  This is the  second natural gas liquification facility to enter service and the first to  be built on the east coast.  Tell us the significance of it and what kind  of production you're expecting here?</p><p> PERRY:  Yes, in an international partnership, Japan and India are both our  partners in this plan, as you can see right over my shoulder, there's a  tanker that's waiting to be filled, and sent on its way.  When I was over  in India earlier in the year, we had a -- we had a load of gas coming in to  India for the first time, so these are amazing times, but the message is  clear.  The United States is blessed because of innovation, hydraulic  fracturing and our ability to directionally drill to have access to the  shale gas, an unconventional play.  It is putting America in a place that  we haven't been in 60 years, a net exporter of natural gas.  </p><p> So, geopolitically, you think about, Maria, five years ago, where we were  from the standpoint of being reliant upon some countries who didn't  necessarily have our best interests in mind to today being the largest oil  and gas producer in the world.  A stunning turnaround and anyone who would  argue that that's bad for the United States, and we're going to be able to  -- on the environmental side -- I think again, it can't be understated how  much of an impact it has to take those old inefficient plants off that are  running in China, in India, and in Germany, for that matter, replace it  with LNG, and I will suggest that for the Germans and for anyone else, the  best interest there is in American LNG not relying upon the Russians as  their sole source.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President has talked a lot about the price of oil and about  manipulation going on in the market.  Do you see more production impacting  oil prices as well?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, here is the real issue from my perspective, the United States  can fill the pipelines around the world, as a matter of fact, we fill the  pipelines so much in United States that that's our limiting factor.  Going  out of the Permian Basin into the world market, it is restricted at this  particular point in time because we don't have the pipeline capacity.  So,  building those pipelines, getting the spigot open in a bigger way from my  perspective and I think from the President as well, is a clear message that  that's the way to help address the price of crude, let's get more in the  market, it's just a plain economic standpoint of supply and demand.  And  when there's a huge demand out there right now, lower restrictions in our  pipelines, but over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll be opening them up. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on this, Russian hackers reportedly  infiltrated a network of electric utilities last year, it's according to  The Wall Street Journal, a Department of Homeland Security official said  that it could have led to blackouts or even worse, how serious is the risk  for hackers to be successful in the near future, Sir?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, it's obviously a real concern that we have, you know, five  years ago, this wasn't something we're particularly worried about, but over  -- I mean, literally millions of times a month, you will see companies that  are being hit, particularly these electrical control panels.  The sector- specific agency that has the responsibility for that is the Department of  Energy.  So, we're working on it, we stood up a new office called Caesar  with cybersecurity as being the real focus there.  Tuesday, I'm going to be  in New York City with the Secretary of Homeland Security and some other  folks who have cybersecurity in their portfolios as well to talk about the  United States and our focus upon cybersecurity in this country.  It is  real, but we've got some of the best in the world that are doing their due  diligence at our national labs to come up with the defensive and the  offensive ways to deal with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Iran, America is pressuring its allies to stop  importing oil from Iran ahead of the reinstated sanctions next week.  Iran  is threatening unspecified countermeasures.  What might they be?  Your  reaction to Iran.</p><p> PERRY:  Maria, the President has been very straightforward, he's been very  blunt with the Iranians.  The destabilization of the Middle East and other  places around the world, he's just not going to put up with it.  And  whatever we need to do to send a message that Iran can be -- you know, they  can -- they can be participants in the world order, they can be  participants in that part of world and do it in a civil and a peaceful  thoughtful way.  If they don't, the President has been very clear, there  will be powerful sanctions, there will be strong pushback from United  States and our allies, sending the message -- this isn't about the Iranian  people, this is about the leadership in that country, the revolutionary  guard in particular, you know, act decent in the world you live in and you  can expect to do business with the United States.  If you don't, there will  be hell to pay. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, he has been very clear.  Secretary, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p> PERRY:  Good.  Maria, so long.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Secretary Rick Perry joining us there.   Coming up, getting rewarded for wearing clothes, how Tommy Hilfiger is  giving customer prices for wearing its brand, coming up.  Then Paul Ryan  poking some fun at himself, the House Speaker's hilarious response to  reading mean tweets about himself, later this hour.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets cheering the thaw in trade tensions  between the U.S. and the European Union, following President Trump's  discussion with E.U. Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker.  We want to talk  more about that in a minute.  We're going to welcome Stuart Varney.  By the  way, yesterday, Stuart said all I want to see is Juncker and President  Trump walk out with smiles and be happy, and the markets are going to turn,  and that's exactly what happened.</p><p> BELL:  Sounds like is exactly what happened.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at the big reaction at the -- after the close.</p><p> BELL:  There was.  I would have like to see --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, even before the close, sorry.</p><p> BELL:  -- more clarity on the auto tariffs, but you know, this is a great  step in the right direction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, let's bring in Stuart Varney who called it,  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you called it.  This time  yesterday, you and I posed the question, what happens if we get some good  news on trade, does the market pop?  I said, yes.  I think you said, yes,  too, Maria.  Come on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But you -- but you had the idea, and that was a great  idea.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because it's true, that's exactly what the market wanted, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  And now, there may be a little bit of a follow  on today.  May I remind you that there's a delegation from Mexico in D.C.  right now, talking trade, they want to wrap up a trade deal, a bilateral  trade deal, you could possibly get some more smiling faces, not necessarily  the news conference, but some smiley faces when they walk out of the  meeting.  That could mean another small leg up for the overall market.   But, to me, the most important thing in that trade deal is that they, the  Europe (AUDIO GAP) take that China, and they're going to take a lot of our  energy, natural gas, take that Russia.  Seems to me that the Europeans  blinked and Trump won again.  That's the way it seems to me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, yes.  We'll see.  I mean, they said that they're going to  work towards zero tariffs, but let's not forget the aluminum and steel  tariffs are still in place, and they said also, Dagen, that it's non-auto.   That's really what the sticking point was, the auto (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That rally was purely based on the fact that this is a de- escalation of tensions, it is a truce on additional tariffs, particularly  the threat of tariffs on the European automobile imports.  But, again,  we're still watching because these steel and aluminum tariffs -- what?</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, look, you're not going to have a tit-for-tat escalation with  Europe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, right.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's not going to happen, they agreed not to do that yesterday.   That was the heart of the good news.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But as one of our viewers just --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's when markets rallied -- yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  As one of our viewers just tweeted, it's time for more go than  show.  It like let's actually get deals done and let's alleviate some of  the pain from the steel and aluminum tariffs. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, he's doing it.  I mean, Stuart just said the Mexicans are  in the White House today and we keep hearing HHS secretary that we speak  with, Stuart, that they feel really good about a deal with Mexico over the  near-term, and they assume that Canada is going to get in line as well once  the Mexico deal is done.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, that's the way it looks.  The incoming -- the new President of  Mexico has -- his top trade advisor has publicly said, they want to wrap up  a deal, a bilateral deal with United States in a matter of months.  Now,  that's a big deal.  If that happens, well, the Canadians, they're going to  have to come on board somehow or other.  I think it's progress all around.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wilbur Ross was on the show earlier, he said, look, Mexico is a  lot more complicated than Canada, and we know that, because Mexico, you  know, there are different deals in terms of workers, where car will  originate in terms of production.  So -- but he, too, was pretty optimistic  about a deal with Mexico.  Stuart, I know you're going to have a lot more  in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you got it.  Sure thing.  Thanks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in just 10 minutes' time.  But first, there's  this, Paul Ryan goes from House Speaker to standup comedian.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Paul Ryan  could be a live action Disney villain. #WidowsPeak\"  They used to call me  Eddie Munster so it's not too much of a stretch.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  More of the tweets, coming up.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investigators are now focused on digital  information in the search for a missing college student in Iowa.  Cheryl  Casone with the details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  Well, using search warrants, authorities are analyzing 20-year- old, Mollie Tibbett's digit info, that includes her Fitbit which she always  wore, her Instagram and her Snapchat data to track her whereabouts and at  least put a timeline together of her whereabouts the night that she  disappeared while out on a run.  She was last seen jogging in her hometown  of Brooklyn, Iowa about a week ago.  All the information is a key piece of  the investigation, it is not being made public, at this time, but they are  getting data off of her devices.</p><p> All right.  Well, check out this incredible video, dozens of people forming  a human chain to save swimmers from a riptide.  You can see them locking  arms up the coast of Emerald Isle, this is in North Carolina, by the way.   Emergency crews also got involved in some of these rescues.  Sadly, they  were unable to revive a 41-year-old man after they pulled him out of the  water.  The water looks, to me, it's terrifying.  Swimmers a lot of times  did not heed the beach safety warnings, so that's kind of what happened  there.</p><p> All right, Tommy Hilfiger is offering rewards to customers who wear its new  line of smart clothing that comes with a smart chip tracking how often  customers wear it.  So you earn points that can be used to buy concert  tickets or merchandise.  The brand hopes that interest in the new line is  going to create a microcommunity of brand ambassadors.  </p><p> And then, there is this, this is fun, House Speaker Paul Ryan posted a  video reading mean tweets about himself, taking inspiration from the  popular Jimmy Kimmel segment.  Watch!</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> RYAN:  Paul Ryan could be live action Disney villain.  #WidowsPeak.   Woodchucks eating Paul Ryan's car has given me hope for the future.  My car  dealer as well.  I want to high-five Paul Ryan's face with a shovel, just  hard enough to make him see birdies.  Take that smug look.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CASONE:  There's the look.  With Ryan not seeking re-election in November,  maybe some of these critics are going to ease up on him.  At least he  proved he can take a serious joke or tell one, if you want to put it that  way, Maria.  It's really funny.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is very funny.  Maybe he's just taking it all in stride  now that he knows he's on his way out.</p><p> CASONE:  Why not?  Relax about it, all right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Take a break.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Love you much every day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Smart, hard-working lady.  The best in the business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  Have a great day.  Go seize  that day.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day.  Yes, indeed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  Let's get right  at it.  This stuff is very important for everyone.  Facebook slowing down,  and that spells real trouble for the company and its investors.  We used a  huge --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It's time to turn  it over to Maria Bartiromo.  Good morning Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there ladies, good  morning to you.  Happy Thursday and good morning everybody, thanks for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook unfriended on Wall Street that's for sure, the stock is plunging  this morning on the edge of the plunge last night, disappointing sales and  revenue guidance.  Nearly $150 billion wiped from market value in the  afterhours trading session.  Incredible drop on Facebook, down seventeen  and a quarter percent right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the sector for sure, the big  names in technology this morning under pressure.  Take a look at Twitter  down three percent and Alphabet, parents of Google down and a third  percent.  Amazon will report its earnings after the close tonight.  Ahead  of that, the stock is down one and a three quarters percent.</p><p>Broader markets this morning look like this, in fact, it's a mixed story.   Dow Industrials are up 50 points but look at the NASDAQ where we've got so  many technology names there and that is down almost one percent, 60 points  lower on the NASDAQ this morning.</p><p>There's wild session on Wall Street yesterday, stock surge in the last 30  minutes of trading.  On news of a softening trade dispute between the U.S.  and the E.U.  President Trump talking about working toward zero tariffs.   Yesterday, the Dow Industrials up 172 points at the close with that huge  rally in the final 30 minutes.  The NASDAQ was up 91 points, better than  one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank in a sense of when rising interest rates might be on the  horizon.  What happens next with European stimulus.  The European markets  are fractionally better on the session with the CAC Quarante in Paris up  three quarters of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up one and a  third percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets mostly lower at the close, as you can see best  performer was Korea.  Kospi Index up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Easing trade tensions, President Trump and European Commission President  Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to negotiate a  trade deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Over the years the United  States has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars with the European  Union and we just want it to be a level playing field for our farmers, for  our manufacturers, for everybody.</p><p>And we also want a big beneficiary to be the European Union, so we think it  can be good for everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning we take a look at the key issues at stake coming  up right now.  Plus, an explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the  only person injured was the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We  have the very latest on this investigation coming up.</p><p>President Trump star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame destroyed.  Take a look,  the suspect using a pick axe and later charged with felony vandalism.  We  will tell you who is bailing him out of jail this morning, coming up.</p><p>Plus, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones standing firm in his support for the  national anthem, he says all players will be required to stand during the  national anthem.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Former NFL Star and  the Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer with us this morning.  Along with CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of news this morning.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  It's going to be a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.  Facebook obviously the story of the moment  Lindsey.  Is that going to be an overhang over the -- over the broader  markets in your view?</p><p>BELL:  You know what, I think it will be an overhang on the tech sector  today but hopefully Amazon can turn the ship around this evening when they  report results.</p><p>I think one thing to note about tech and the overall market in general is  going into the earning season.  I was really concerned about CAPEX  declining because it had been up on average 40 percent over the last three  quarters.</p><p>But you saw even though Facebook's numbers weren't great and the outlook  was poor, they increase CAPEX spending, so did Google.  They more -- they  like doubled it.  And then you're also seeing industrial companies  increased their CAPEX, so it's very good for future growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That conference call really sounded wild last night Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Again, there's an  incredible, what they call in journalism a tick tock in the Wall Street  Journal about that conference call.  How Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl  Sandberg come on the call and talk about how awesome business is and  Instagram is so amazing.</p><p>And then the chief financial officer comes on and drops one bomb after  another in terms of talking about the growth -- revenue growth rate isn't  just slowing in the second quarter but it's going to continue to do that in  the third and fourth quarter. </p><p>There was trouble because of the new European regulations.  Currency  headwinds, new privacy options for users, he -- that was part of the blame  but he said that new ad formats such as those within the Instagram stories  are not pulling the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and  Instagram feeds.  So there's a lot of bad news in there.  </p><p>Just putting exclamation point on it, we had Facebook at a new all-time  high yesterday.  In one day the stock is almost in bear market territory.   In one day it went from an all-time high to nearly a bear market which  would be a 20 percent drop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Seventy percent drop right now and I guess it became clear last  night that all those investment into security, into privacy as a result of  what's been going on with privacy is going to cut into growth.</p><p>Bottom line, Facebook is not going to be immune to this.  You mentioned  story segments section in Instagram, that's not going to bring the margins  that the rest of the company has been bringing, that's the bottom line.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  So they're going to have to figure out--again, because  the story is a memo--it's sort of an offshoot of Snapchat, they put those  in place to take on Snapchat because they're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where it goes away in 24 hours.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  They're -- but I -- following those stories and using  them, there are ways that they can better integrate the actual -- to  monetize those and then to place the ads in those stories.  So they're  asking for a long runway.  Well today, investors are not giving an answer  on them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  It says margins are getting cut going forward because of all this  and their investments especially in security.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, this is the group that has been the  leadership in terms of gains for the broader markets.  This is where the  money has been moving.  So there's probably expectations up here and the  realities over here.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And just real quick, because I'm not a phony, that was an  outstanding news coming out of the White House yesterday, that's exactly  what investors needed to hear in terms of cooling the tariff tensions, the  trade tensions and giving kind of some insights to the road ahead, a  renegotiating trade deals.  Maybe even with Europe which is a goal but then  NAFTA and then taking on China. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets obviously reacted to that immediately.  The president  comes out with Mr. Juncker and starts talking about working towards zero  tariffs which by the way was exactly what the president has been trying to  get for -- from a lot of these players.  </p><p>Yesterday we heard from a number of players that Mexico may be next.  We'll  see if they can do a deal with Mexico and then Canada follows along.  This  whole wild, you know, upset over the tariffs will go away.  So we'll see.   And then there's the NFL Jack Brewer, what do you think about Jerry Jones?</p><p>BREWER:  Ah, it's expected.  You know, Jerry has -- he stood strong, this  is not a change in his approach, in his tone in regards to this whole  situation.  You know, it's one thing to talk about kneeling with the goal  and to actually pass a policy then pull it back, go back and forth.</p><p>I'm interested in owner seat like Jerry Jones.  His fan base wants to see  his players stand for the national anthem, I understand that.  I know, I've  said this before, right, people, this is America, you can stand, you can  kneel, you can do what you want.  But if your boss tells you to stand, you  stand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you stand.  And that's what we are this morning.  A lot of  stories to cover.  </p><p>We want to kick it off right here with our trade ceasefire story, top of  news.  President Trump headed to Granite City, Illinois this morning where  he is set to tour a steel mill that is now boosting production following  the president's move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  earlier this year.  This visit coming a day after announcing a breakthrough  in trade talks with the European Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We agreed today first of all to work together towards zero tariffs,  zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,  thank you.</p><p>While we are working on this, we will not go against the spirit of this  agreement unless either party terminates the negotiation.  So we're  starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it's going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still, the tariffs on aluminum and steel are costing American  companies.  Both Coca Cola and General Motors now say they will have to  raise prices on their products in large part because of the president's  trade fights.</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in from Washington is Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Thank you for having me on Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a big deal yesterday with the president and Mr.  Juncker.  Can you go through what was -- what was agreed upon?</p><p>ROSS:  Surely.  The objectives of a new trade negotiation have been very  firmly set, zero -- we're going towards zero tariffs, zero nontariff trade  barriers, zero subsidies.</p><p>So that should really level the playing field and enable American companies  to be fully competitive and get the kind of market access that they need.   Meanwhile, the steel and aluminum tariffs stay in place, we will continue  pursuing our investigation of the Automotive 232 and hopefully these  negotiations will be completed fairly quickly so that we can get to the  stable situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is the plan to eventually do away with the aluminum and  steel tariffs or the auto tariffs?  I mean, even on light trucks the U.S.  charges, what, 255 percent, right?</p><p>ROSS:  Well you notice on light trucks, the -- there was an exception for  automotive products.  It's said we'd work toward zero tariffs on  nonautomotive industrial products.  And to steel and aluminum, there's no  attention to abandon those industries.</p><p>So the president is very happy with the progress they have made and opening  new facilities.  I'm joining them today as we go out to visit one that had  just recently been reopened.  He's not going to do anything to destroy  steel and aluminum from their new found substance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was there a timeline discussed Secretary in terms of when we  might see actual clarity on what the trade deal will look like between the  U.S. and the E.U.?</p><p>ROSS:  There's no precise time table set because that's not a meaningful  thing.  But the president made it very clear he is not going to sit around  for the normal two, three years to get a trade deal done.</p><p>Since we've got the broad principals agreed, it now should be more filling  in the blanks than starting from ground zero.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what do you think about these tariffs hitting Detroit?   General Motors, Ford, and FiatChrysler all yesterday lowered guidance.   Are you suggesting their full year outlook says they revealed lower than  expected second quarter earnings, all of which were impacted by the rising  cost of steel and aluminum.</p><p>So Mr. Secretary, will the president's negotiations with the E.U. reverse  what's going on with the automakers?  We are already seeing that they're  expecting this to impact their business.</p><p>ROSS:  Well, I have said before, the impact of steel and aluminum on the  auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about one percent on the  cost of the vehicle.  </p><p>So to the degree that that might be passed along, that's possible.  But the  offsetting thing is what you're seeing unemployment figures.  Record low  unemployment, more jobs available than there are people available to fill  them for the first time ever.</p><p>Record low unemployment for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for women,  for young people.  I mean, the economy is booming and that's what's really  important.  The other important thing though is the president has made  clear he's not going to abandon the industries that just has helped to  revitalized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what's the next priority then Wilbur?  We've been  talking a lot about the potential for a deal with Mexico.  Is that the  priority now as you continue to work with the E.U.?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we're working on a lot of different fronts all at the same  time.  And that shows you the speed and the breath of the president's  sculpt of these trace issues.</p><p>We have to get them fixed in a fairly short period of time.  They've gone  on too long, unchecked by prior administrations.  As to Mexico, the new  president very quickly appointed the team that would do the trade  negotiations for him has made very clear he wants to get a deal done.</p><p>And he did all of this without even waiting for his inauguration.  He'll be  inaugurated on the first of December and it looks pretty clear that his  goal would be to try to get something resolved between the United States  and Mexico prior to even his inauguration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think you -- is it fair to say then the change in  leadership in Mexico also was very positive toward better relations with  the U.S.?</p><p>ROSS:  Well potentially so.  It certainly has made us all feel a lot better  than we did during some of the campaign rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think that Canada will be close behind once you do do a  deal -- a new NAFTA deal with Mexico?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we hope so but the immediate focus is much more on Mexico.  The  issues there are more complex and we think we can get very good progress  very quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  Let me move on to China Secretary, the president  there said this morning that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.  Your reaction to what's coming out of China?  </p><p>Do you feel that you've been able to move the needle yet in terms of their  theft of intellectual property and technology?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we haven't seen any formal steps to resolve those issues.  But  you see these repeated announcements coming out of China, things that  they're doing with the banking system bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.</p><p>Clearly, they're feeling a pressure from the tariffs that the president has  put on and equally clearly they're having some difficulty implementing  their retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you feel better now that there's this agreement in place  with the E.U. potentially teaming up with the E.U. against China to  pressure China to stop bad behavior?</p><p>ROSS:  Well as we know, the E.U. has suggested several times publicly that  they hope they could resolve things with us so that they could join with us  very aggressively in dealings with China.</p><p>We'll have to see what turns out from that but it certainly is a good step  regardless what happens with China to move toward a level playing field and  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barrier and zero subsidy environment with the  E.U.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  A lot of great information Secretary, good to see  you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ROSS:  Thanks Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us there.  Coming up, breaking  overnight, an explosion outside the U.S. Embassy in China.  We will have  the very latest on this Beijing blast.  </p><p>Then big oil, big profits.  Analysts predicting another huge earning  season, we're taking a closer look at big oil as they start reporting  today.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A bomb exploding near the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing overnight, Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines.   Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  We're trying to get more  details Maria but here's what we know so far, police say the blast injured  the 26-year-old man, he was holding the device.</p><p>It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is from  Mongolia.  The motive though, we don't know at this point.  The U.S.  Embassy was not damaged and thankfully no U.S. personnel or anyone in the  area were hurt by this blast.</p><p>Well, Qualcomm now planning to scrap its plan to buy NXP semiconductors  after the deadline passed at midnight without any word on Chinese  regulatory approval.  China was the last of nine markets, they needed to  approve the $44 billion deal.</p><p>This appears to be the latest victim of U.S.-China trade tensions.  Shares  of Qualcomm, well, they're saving some money I guess, think of it that way.   The stock is up a little more than five percent in the premarket right now.  </p><p>All right.  Some other companies we want to talk about, Royal Dutch Shell  reporting its second quarter earnings jumping about 30 percent.  Net income  rise in the $6.02 billion from $1.54 billion from a year earlier.  He oil  company is obviously benefiting from higher energy prices.  Shell now plans  to buy back about $25 billion of its stock over the next two years.  </p><p>They made that announcement.  Shares of Shell, lower in the premarket, down  almost two and a half percent.  The earnings missed analysts estimates but  sell over of a mix back for Shell.  A lot of more earnings coming up,  Amazon as well today Maria.  So a lot of big names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Amazon after the bell.  And Qualcomm also  this morning announcing it's going to be buying back $30 billion of stock.   Buybacks continuing as well.  Cheryl, Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, if you're suit up to play, stand for the national anthem.   That's the mandate from the owner of the Dallas Cowboys this morning.  It  is the latest twist in this controversy.  </p><p>Then this, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame is smashed to pieces  again, you won't believe who bailed this guy out of jail after he did that.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Standing for the national anthem, Jared Max now  with the latest on the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' new requirement.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  New and similar to what we've seen  Maria.  Jerry Jones hasn't really waffled in his public stance on the  importance of his players, the men he employs and pays handsomely to stand  for the national anthem.</p><p>While there is currently no active policy on the anthem as the NFL and  Players Association said last week in a joint statement, they are working  toward resolution privately.  Yesterday Jones spoke out publicly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JERRY JONES, OWNER, DALLAS COWBOY:  Obviously wouldn't dare speak for any  of the other owners much less in general about 31 other owners.  But as far  as the Dallas Cowboys are concerned, you know where I stand.</p><p>It's our position that we've always had a written policy in place.  Our  policy is that you stand at the anthem, tow on the line.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Tow on the line.  But what about actions speak louder than words?   Remember last season after President Trump had weighed in heavily on the  anthem, Jones joined his players and team staff at a momentary kneel before  they stood for the anthem.  Jerry Jones, where are you today on President  Trump?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  His interest in what we're doing is problematic from my chair and I  would say in general the owner's share.  It's unprecedented if you really  think about it.  Like the very game itself, that's the way it is and we'll  deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  And for now there are no new national anthem policies into the NFL,  the League and Players Association said last week it will be several weeks  before we have a policy in place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Your reaction Jack?</p><p>BREWER:  Well I got two things to say, you know, we talked about this for a  long time and I don't think it's going anywhere.  You know, the National  Football League is the largest wealth creator for young African-American  men in this country.</p><p>And I just hate to see anything being done that's going to take away from  that.  I don't want to piss off any fans, I don't want make anyone upset,  because I know that those revenues and those resources that are going into  communities of color because of these African-American men getting wealth,  I want to keep that going.</p><p>And so I'll say that first.  The second thing I'll say is there are so many  issues that are facing NFL players, we talked about this before Jared  particularly with concussions and you have all of the drug issues with  giving guys too many opioids and all of the crisis that are going on, let's  talk about that too Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  And --</p><p>BREWER:  I mean --</p><p>MAX:  -- players, also the retired players --</p><p>BREWER:  Exactly.</p><p>MAX:  -- you know, we hear -- you know, we're waiting for a lot of money  from NFL settlements.  But, again, this anthem issue Maria is tremendous.   Jerry Jones, I think speaks the volumes when he says I like everybody would  like for this to go away because very much, you know, sports is always the  divider where we didn't get politics into sports, that's where we went to  get away --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MAX:  -- from that.  But here we have this intersection where it doesn't  necessarily work for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  I like what Jack said earlier, if your boss tells you to  stand you do it.  If my boss tells me to stand giving a presentation, I'm  going to do it, you know.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  I mean it's --</p><p>BREWER:  And with football, it's even deeper because we know, we do  everything uniform, right?  You have -- you wear the same socks, you go to  pull them up, you wear the same uniform.  You can't wear Adidas, you got to  wear Nike.</p><p>You know, there's rules.  So I'm a big believer in that.  You know, I  listen to my dad, I listen to my teacher, I listen to law enforcement.  I  think, you know, that is a reflection of the new society that we have.  You  know, we've got to start respecting authority again.  We got to start  listening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you say the NFL is this great wealth creator, that's  because of America.  </p><p>BREWER:  One hundred percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's more than just your boss tells you to stand up, it's  because you're honoring America and the flag.  </p><p>BREWER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But a lot -- but you'll agree with this and it comes down to the  issue of when you go to work, you have to abide by your employer's rules  and it's -- and it's different in NFL because there's a player's contract,  there's a union contract with the league.</p><p>But I can't say whatever I feel like quite frankly, certainly not even in  my private life.  Is Twitter my private account or is it part of an  extension of where I work?  I can't say or do whatever I want and not face  any consequences.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though we firmly believe in the first amendment, the right  to free speech and a free press.  It -- that is not an unbridled right in  this country.  And when you're in the workplace, you kind of have -- like  you said, there are rules in the NFL and there will be rules about what you  can say and do during the national anthem.</p><p>BREWER:  Right.</p><p>MAX:  And they're working it out.  Hopefully they're going to work it out.   Nobody has got here.  Roger Goodell isn't, President Trump isn't.  This is  -- this is working it out, you know, in a sense of just we're going to do  it for the first time, we don't have the answers, right?  We don't have the  answers.  The other leagues stand.  The other leagues stand.  So --</p><p>BREWER:  That's why (INAUDIBLE) they're not picking on the NFL.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>BREWER:  They're not doing anything than any other sports league. </p><p>MAX:  And two other football leagues coming.</p><p>BREWER:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's  sports report on FOX News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio on XM115.  </p><p>We'll take a break, we got a lot going on this morning.  Coming up,  removing Rod Rosenstein, a group of House Republicans have introduced  articles of impeachment against the Deputy Attorney General.  More on that  move and whether or not it will take him out.</p><p>Then Wal-Mart driving sales in a whole new way, a glimpse into the future  of shopping right here.  </p><p>Plus, the latest on Facebook, setting the tone for market this morning,  down 17 percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 26th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Investors disconnecting from Facebook, this morning, the stock is getting  hammered after the company reported disappointing sales and revenue  guidance, the company lost $150 billion in market value, yesterday alone.   The conference call created some confusion in terms of will the company  continue to be able to grow the way it has, 30 percent, looks like, not.</p><p>Futures this morning, indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages,  take a look, Dow Industrials up 24, but the NASDAQ, taking a hit hard, down  almost one percent, largely on weakness on technology on the heels of  Facebook.  </p><p>Stocks surged in last 30 minutes of trading, yesterday, on reports of a  softening trade dispute between the E.U. and the U.S.  They -- the two  leaders, yesterday, came out and said that they are working toward a zero  policy, zero tariffs, and zero subsidies between the two.</p><p>In Europe this morning, investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank.  We will get a sense of when rising interest rates might be  on the horizon.  FT-100 is flat this morning, but the CAC Quarante is up a  third of a percent.  The DAX Index in Germany up better than one percent.  </p><p>Asian markets closed lower, mostly, overnight, with the exception of Korea.   Worst performer was China.  Shanghai composite down three quarters of one  percent.  </p><p>Easing the trade tip, President Trump coming away from his meeting with the  European Commission president, with a renewed sense of optimism after  making progress toward a deal.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a call for impeachment, Conservative lawmakers were taking the  first steps to try to impeach Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  We  are taking a look at whether this resolution has a path forward, straight  ahead.</p><p>President Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized,  again.  You won't believe who is helping the vandal get out of jail, this  morning.  And if you're shopping at Wal-Mart, your next ride could be a  self-driving car.  Details on the retailers partnership with Waymo, coming  up this hour.</p><p>All that coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour, House  Republicans versus the Justice Department, House Conservatives filing  articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>The move coming after months of back and forth over documents related to  the Hillary Clinton and Trump investigations.  Congressman Mark Meadows and  Jim Jordan who filed the articles of impeachment, spoke with Fox News'  Laura Engram, last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  Well, we get the documents or we  impeach him.  And the only thing that we have control over is the ability  to bring impeachment straight to the floor.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  When was the last time you ever saw the FBI  take a disproven document with no credibility, no validity, no  corroboration, take it to a secret court, not tell the court who paid for  it, not tell the court that the guy who had wrote it had been leaking  information to the press, and not just once, four stinking times, and the  last one, Rod Rosenstein signed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Christopher  Bedford, he's the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Caller.  Chris, good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you the think this has legs impeaching Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>BEDFORD:  More on the public relations front, it seems.  The Conservatives  have been frustrated for a number of weeks.  And this document, the  articles of impeachment, has been circulating leadership and the  Republicans have been trying to tamp down on it, and say, guys, hold on a  second.  </p><p>Department of Justice have been meeting with people, just last night,  meeting with congressman in the Hill to try and see if they could figure  out a way to avoid this.  But Meadows and Jordan are pushing on.  Now, what  they would need, they need to force votes.  They haven't done yet.  </p><p>Right now, they referred it to the judiciary committee.  They could do that  as early as today, and then it would take two days or maybe longer to force  a vote.  But they would need half of the U.S. Congress to impeach him, and  they would need two thirds of the U.S. Congress to actually remove him.   And since Republicans are so split on this, I don't see either of those  things happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, the documents that have been delayed, do you  think this maybe puts a fire under the DOJ to get those documents to the  congressional investigators?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's one of the arrows in the repertoire here.  It's difficult to  try and put a fire under the DOJ and then Jordan and Meadows have been  saying that they're having more trouble getting documents out of out of  this DOJ or as much as they had under Eric Holder's DOJ, the Obama  administration's DOJ.  They are redacting information that's embarrassing.  </p><p>They're not being forthcoming and what it seems to be the last draw for the  Conservatives, was Rosenstein signing off on the actual -- on the -- on the  FISA court that used the discredited dossier, that seems to have been the  last straw that pushed Conservatives over and said, you know what, we're  going to push this out now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meadows -- Chris, it's Dagen McDowell, Meadows, last night, on  Laura Ingraham show, kind of hinted that they could make this resolution  live today, that would force a vote in the House.  However, after -- I  think there's a vote this morning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  After that,  Congress is gone until September the Fourth, so --</p><p>BEDFORD:  It would take a while for them to be able to do that.  So they  move very quickly this morning and very few things move very quickly in  Congress.  They can potentially force a vote that would have to be made  within the next two days.  </p><p>But as you said with recess coming up, this seems like it's more trying to  draw attention to the battle the Conservatives are having with DOJ than  actually realistic effort to remove the attorney general -- deputy attorney  general.  </p><p>BREWER:  Chris, this is Jack Brewer, how much did the past Trump-Putin  summit hurt the rally of support around this latest effort?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I strongly suspect that that was the reason we didn't see this  last week because the Conservatives have been pushing to move this last  week, and then after Trump took so much -- President Trump took so much  criticism over how he appeared to handle the summit, they -- I think they  held it off over a week and seems like it was dead.  </p><p>We had reporters that were ready to break the news that was happening.  But  we assumed that it was dead, and heard that it was dead after that summit.   And then I think what really pushed it over again was signing the warrant  here on the evidence here for the FISA warrant.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we knew that he signed off on the FISA warrant for  the fourth time.  We've known that for some time.  National Security  Adviser, John Bolton, commented on a future Trump-Putin summit.  </p><p>He issued this statement saying this, the President believes that the next  bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia  witch-hunt is over, so we've agreed that it will be after the first of the  year.</p><p>This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified yesterday before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defending the administration's policies  on Russia.  I thought he did really well.  Check out this exchange he had  with the Democratic Senator that was Chris Murphy.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT:  How do I know the difference between a  presidential statement that is not a policy and a statement that is?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  Senator, here's what you  should look at, compare the following, Barack Obama speaking tough on  Russia and doing nothing.</p><p>MURPHY:  Those are true.</p><p>POMPEO:  It is true.</p><p>MURPHY:  I understand you want to rewrite the Obama policy on Russia.  But  that's simply --</p><p>POMPEO:  OK.  </p><p>MURPHY:  He organized all of Europe and all over the world.  </p><p>POMPEO:  Let's go.  Let's go, Senator.  Let's go.  Let's go task to task.</p><p>MURPHY:  To put a comprehensive on president instead of sanctions on  Russia.</p><p>POMPEO:  The man said he would have more flexibility after --</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm not listening --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on what took place yesterday, and what do  you think the Russia policy is going forward?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It was a pretty fiery exchange, the Secretary came absolutely  ready to do battle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I really enjoyed some of the back and forth, that was -- it was  good television.  But I'm not sure how much further we got toward  understanding much.  I think he made a forceful defense of the  administration here, when he pointed out to the senators who were doubtful.  </p><p>That President Trump and his administration are not -- or inseparable, if  the administration doubles down on sanctions, removes more spies, shuts  down more compounds, deregulates energy, sends natural gas to Europe,  pushes for a stronger NATO, lethal aid to Ukraine, missiles back to Poland,  those aren't actions that take place without the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  His signatures on every one of those.  And the Senate didn't seem  to want to believe that and they were really seemingly trying to push a  narrative that was different.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he said a couple of times.  This is President Trump's  state department.  So, President Trump, at the end of the day, is in charge  of this decision-making.  But I thought it was really interesting the way  he defended the private meeting, the one-on-one with Putin.  He did a very  good job on that, Dagen, what did you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Incredibly measured.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And any of us watching the Secretary of State, had to sit there,  and listen to the garbage that was pouring out of the mouths of the  Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We tip our hats --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They put on a show.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, in terms of the level of insanity among  Democrats about Russia, Chuck Schumer, yesterday, was talking about the aid  to farmers because of the tariff fight that we've got into, as something  from the Soviet Union.</p><p>Number one, when did a Democrat hate a handout?  And number two, they have  to somehow link that whether you like it or not, to Russia and Putin and  the USSR, Chris, that -- again, that is something that does not resonate  with most Americans.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The USSR comparisons I saw yesterday were absolutely shameful.   Comparing President Trump's economic policy to the five-year plan, last  time I heard President Trump wasn't rounding up millions of Americans and  putting them in industrial labor camps at North Dakota and executing them  in mass.  </p><p>There was absolutely no comparison between aiding farmers during a trade  war that the administration is intending to win.  It doesn't want to leave  casualties in the battlefield.  And then Stalin asked economic planning  which murdered millions of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was pathetic, it was shameful, but it was more of the same,  right?  So, you know, with the immigration story, the next thing is abolish  ICE.  You know, I mean, they just go way too far with the analysis here.  </p><p>The Russia-Putin strategy, though, do you think it has been tougher than  the Obama administration?  I mean, that's a fair statement that regardless  of what happened in Helsinki at that press conference, the actual policies  have been tough on Russia?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Demonstrably tougher.  Every single difficult or tough step that  the Obama administration took, President Trump's administration has  maintained and then doubled down on most of those being economic and people  being deported or expelled from the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  In addition to that, the lethal aid and the energy aid to Europe  have been absolutely crucial.  The Russia gets its courage from energy  prices, deregulating the U.S. energy industry and sending natural gas to  Europe, that hurts Russia directly in its pocketbook.  </p><p>And being willing to about -- talk to Russia or as Secretary Pompeo said  (INAUDIBLE) remote chances are that we could come to an understanding with  Russia is something that should be pursued by any administration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  in the meantime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was a topic that was discussed yesterday with Mr.  Juncker, as well.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, it was.  I just -- Chris, I just wonder, there wasn't a lot of  information that came out of this and maybe that is to the secretaries --  you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By design?</p><p>BELL:  Yes, by design.  But the question is, though, does this lead to a  request for the translator to come in or for the Senate to see their notes?</p><p>BEDFORD:  The level of partisanship that we've seen that's absolutely  possible, we have seen the translators, the gentleman who translated for  President Bush, President Barack Obama, President Clinton, saying that this  President would be obscene.  </p><p>The ability for a leader to be able to have a private discussion with a  member of a cabinet or another foreign leader is critical.  I think it  would be a bad step.  </p><p>And if Republicans would very likely try as best they could to hold the  line, although people like Senator John McCain, have shown that they're  really disappointed in President Trump's interactions with Putin.  And they  may switch, also Senator Bob Corker who is one of the leaders yesterday in  grilling the Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the Secretary kept saying things like, well, look,  you do a private meeting and you keep it private because you're hoping to  have a second private meeting, and to actually make progress, and he kept  saying it back to them.  I'm sure you've had one-on-one meetings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was a gift, though, to delay the second meeting with Putin,  to delay it after the midterm elections, that's just a gift to anybody  running -- any Republican running for re-election because they can focus on  the issues and the things that truly matter to the American people, like  this booming economy, and not the tete-a-tete with Putin and Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great point.  Chris, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, Christopher Bedford, Daily Caller, there.   Coming up, days after a fatal shooting rampage in Toronto, officials there  want to ban handgun sales, more on that plan, coming up.  </p><p>Then, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame, smashed to pieces, once  again.  And you won't believe who reportedly wants to pay the guy's bail to  get him out of jail after doing that, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Toronto seeking a ban of handguns sales in the  city, following a deadly shooting.  Cheryl Casone on details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, reaction is pretty swift there in Toronto.  The City  Council voting 41 to four to ban handgun sales along with sales of  ammunition for handguns, after two people died in shooting rampage last  Sunday.  13 others were hurt when the gunman opened fire in Toronto's great  town neighborhood.  Now, the suspect, 29-year-old, Faisal Hussein,  reportedly died after shooting himself.  Police are still looking into a  motive for that deadly attack.  </p><p>Well, back here at home, President Trump's star in the Hollywood walk of  fame has been vandalized again.  The 24-year-old vandal turned himself in  the police -- turned himself in -- after he destroyed it early Wednesday  morning.  Now, he's been held on $20,000 bail.  Here's what's interesting,  you may remember this guy, take a look at this guy who took a sledgehammer  and axe to President Trump's star just before the election in 2016.  Well,  reportedly, he wants to bail out the newest perpetrator.  Crews have  already started working to repair that damaged star.  </p><p>OK.  Waymo teaming up with Wal-Mart.  The company going to give shoppers a  lift to Wal-Mart in its self-driving cars under a pilot program.  Right  now, up to 400 people in Phoenix, Arizona -- known as early riders -- can  order their food on Wal-Mart.com, pick it up at a Waymo vehicle, and they  get dropped off back at home.  Shares of Wal-Mart are down about 10 percent  this year.  Shares of Alphabet, which is of course the parent of Waymo, up  about 20 percent, Maria.  So, you know, if you're going to pick up and take  me there and bring me, yes, I'm OK with that -- as long as it's free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The elderly still, you know, who still want to shop for  themselves and have trouble getting into the store, how about people who  just need a helping hand?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very important.  Yes.  Coming up, Kalahari Resorts, the  sport and entertainment leader about to team up with a fall tradition for  one of a kind partnership -- details on that high-flying deal next.  And  we're following Facebook this morning, down 17 percent; setting the tone  for markets after growth is being questioned that the company, after its  latest second quarter earnings.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, how cool is that?  That storm chaser an interactive  waterslide in videogame at Kalahari Resorts in Sandusky, Ohio.  Kalahari is  valued at a billion-dollar and just announced a new float in this year's  Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.  Joining us right is Kalahari Resorts and  Conventions Owner, Todd Nelson.  Todd, great to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>TODD NELSON, OWNER, KALAHARI RESORTS AND CONVENTIONS:  Well, great to be  back again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll get to that Macy's partnership in a second, but how's  business going, characterize the environment that you're seeing right now.  </p><p>NELSON:  Business is really solid.  The economy is great.  People are  traveling and so we were just knocking on wood every day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to raise prices?  </p><p>NELSON:  No.  No, we would never do that, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Never.  Never is a long time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How sensitive are your customers to rising gas prices?  Though,  they're not -- they're up from a year ago but -- that has eased back a  little bit.  And I just wonder because you did so well during the great  recession of 2008, part of that, you know, oil and gas prices collapsed,  but how sensitive are the customers to gas?  </p><p>NELSON:  I don't think gas prices has a huge effect on us.  We drive  through destinations in all of our resorts and that's why we did so well  during the recession.  You know, we're typically a tank-full a gas away  from our four-hour driving switches our markets.  </p><p>BELL:  So, you're opening a new location in Round Rock, Texas; how do you  pick the locations for these parks?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, that one was really interesting.  We looked at Dallas and we  looked all over the state, and then 40 to 50 percent of our business comes  through our convention center.  So, Round Rock is just centrally located  right in the middle of the state -- 20 miles our of Austin.  Fantastic.   They really get business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, then, it's relying somewhat on the business community and  doing conventions?  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh, yes, 40 to 50 percent of our occupied rooms are.  But we're  very much into association business and in different types and even during  the recession, it really did not affect.  </p><p>BREWER:  Do you have a membership club or do you have any type of -- kind  of elite membership opportunities that you offer?  </p><p>NELSON:  No, we don't, but we are open to the community.  You don't have to  stay there to come in and enjoy our restaurants, shopping, and spa.  You  can even buy daily passes to come into the waterpark for a sustain.  So,  it's really resort-center build for everybody and every age.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important to get the balloon in the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day parade for you, tell us about that partnership?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, it's actually a float.  And it's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's water involved?</p><p>NELSON:  Yes, animatronics is involved, and it is going to be spectacular.   It's goings to be one of the Macy's -- it's just really cool.  54 million  people watch the parade.  They air it twice and in our market area, it's a  perfect partnership.  They're wonder people.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will there be people in bathing suits on this float in the water  because it's cold here in November?  </p><p>NELSON:  Yes, I don't think there'll be anybody swimming on our float.   There is going to be a, I think, a dozen people on the float, but it's  really going to be a cool float.  We visited the studio yesterday, it's  about half finished and it's gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm actually serious, I love a good water park, so anything  that screams -- that screams water slide is awesome.  How are you  innovating in terms of the rides and the attractions in the park?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, the first ride you saw, that's a virtual reality riding --  you actually play a game as you're going down it.  What we're trying to do  is we hit all age groups.  So, if you fear -- if you want to go to swim-up  in (INAUDIBLE), that's great for our older ones.  We have 12 grandchildren  now, so we've gotten really good at the five and under.  So, every age  bracket, there's something to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute this strength in the economy in the  backdrop in your business?  </p><p>NELSON:  I think there's consumer confidence right now.  I think people are  pretty -- into the economy and they said we do well in good economies and  bad economies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did the tax plan have an impact on your business?  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The tax cut plan?</p><p>NELSON:  Yes, I think it had a real nice effect on the business.  It put  more money on people's pockets, you know.  And people have to feel good  about spending their money.  </p><p>BELL:  What about National Waterpark Day?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it's Saturday.  </p><p>NELSON:  It's Saturday July 28th.  We actually founded National Waterpark  Day.  It is a holiday -- it's a national holiday now, and it was quite an  interesting process, and so we're going to turn that into a big deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Well, cheers to you and congrats, Todd.  Thanks very  much for telling us about it.  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, thank you very much, great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Todd Nelson, Kalahari Resorts.  Still ahead,  no more free lunch at Facebook.

Welcome back.  Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday.  It is Thursday, July 26th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Facebook unfriended on Wall Street this morning.  The stock is plunging on  disappointing sales and revenue guidance, nearly $150 billion of market  value wiped out in the after hours trading session.  The stock right now  down about 19 percent right now.</p><p>Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the tech sector.  The biggest  names in technology under pressure this morning.  Amazon is going to be the  one to watch today.  It reports after the close.  Going into the numbers,  the stock is down one and three-quarters percent.  Check out Twitter down  3.5 percent, Snap down 4 percent.</p><p>Broader markets meanwhile look like this.  Dow Industrials are fine, up 30  points.  But the Nasdaq taking a hit on the weakness in tech.  Nasdaq down  64 points right now, almost 1 percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a  percent.</p><p>It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday particularly in the final  hour of trading.  Stocks surging in just the last 30 minutes of trading on  reports of a softening trade dispute between the U.S. and the E.U.   President Trump explained why it's important to get a trade deal in place.   Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States and the  European Union together count for more than 830 million citizens and more  than 50 percent of the global GDP.  In other words, together we're more  than 50 percent of trade.  If we team up, we can make our planet a better,  more secure and more prosperous place.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Global markets this morning reacting.  We've got the CAC 40 in  Paris up a third of a percent.  The DAX index in Germany up better than 1  percent.  The FT 100 in London up just a fraction.</p><p>In Europe investors are waiting to hear from the European Central Bank.  We  will hear from the ECB and get a sense of when interest rates will be on  the rise coming up.  And we will bring that to you as soon as it hits the  tape.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly lower with the exception of  Korea.  That was up three-quarters of a percent.  </p><p>And then this -- censoring conservative ideas; a startling new report says  Twitter is shadow banning top Republican officials.  It's not happening to  Democrats.  The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>Bitcoin making a comeback -- the cryptocurrency surging above $8,000 for  the first time in months -- a closer look at the crypto craze this morning.</p><p>And there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, San Francisco is  trying to take away the free food at technology companies' cafeterias.   We'll tell you why.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Former NFL star and the  Brewer Group CEO Jack Brewer with us this morning; and CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.  </p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  Great to be here. BARTIROMO:  And the big story is Facebook this morning is down now 19  percent, Lindsey -- because people are now questioning about this 30  percent growth number that we've been seeing for so long at Facebook.   Looks like that's in the rear view mirror at this point.  </p><p>BELL:  But even declining by high single digits sequentially quarter over  quarter, which is the guidance that management provided, you're still  getting 20 percent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- top line growth.  Where else are you going to get that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  But you have to wonder if the stock where it's  trading at is equal to that kind of growth versus what else we were seeing  at Facebook.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'll point to the Instagram  stories issue, because it was in the Instagram stories -- they're not  pulling in the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and in the  Instagram feeds.  </p><p>And this is particularly troubling because as of next year Facebook had  been predicting that the stories would have more essentially traffic than  the original photo feeds on Instagram.  So again, that's where they were  placing their bets.  Now they have to figure out a better way to monetize  these Facebook stories.</p><p>And they have been gaining traction.  A lot of people use those rather than  just kind of posting the run-of-the-mill photos and videos to their  Instagram feeds.  They're using those ones that disappear in 24 hours.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think Jack was posting a story earlier this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you posting?</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  I post the story -- I always post stories.  But they're  going to have to evolve that business model on the ad side when you talk  about stories.  I think at the end of the day you'll see over the next  maybe six to 12 months they're going to start using their influencers a  little bit more.  I think you'll see more partnerships with influencers  because those are the ones that are really driving the traffic.</p><p>Even -- look at YouTube now.  I mean if you go on YouTube now, a lot of  those ads and those pieces they're putting out, YouTube is actually  assisting the companies in producing those ads.</p><p>And so these social media companies are going to have to get more hands-on  with the way that they're putting the stories out, with the way that  they're actually generating the content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the news on Facebook is offsetting other positive news in  terms of trade.  Markets rallied on the results of a meeting yesterday with  the European Commission's Mr. Juncker and President Trump.</p><p>Joining us right now on the telephone is LJH Investment Advisers managing  director Larry Haverty.  Larry -- thanks very much for calling in this  morning.  Your reaction to Facebook?</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISERS:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry -- unfortunately, you're going in and out.  We're not  hearing you well.  Obviously, you're on a cell phone.  We would love to get  your insights on this.</p><p>But of course, $150 billion in lost market value in the after hours trading  session is what people are reacting to today.  Was it an overreaction in  your view?  </p><p>BELL:  No, I mean I think this has been a high flier.  It was up 25 percent  going into this press (ph).  There were high expectations.  And you know,  we got lucky in the first quarter.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not -- you didn't see it in the  numbers.  Now you're seeing it in the numbers.  There are repercussions for  this type of activity.  And there's -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially as they invest more in privacy tools.  That's going  to cost money.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's maybe short-term loss for a long-term gain.  These are  problems that have to get fixed if Facebook wants to retain this giant user  base that it has and continue to grow and monetize.  The people are using  say WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>But to shine a spotlight on what the stock is doing, shares hit an all-time  high yesterday -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and so in less than 24 hours essentially, it's gone into bear  market territory with almost down 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Left it all out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is so astonishing to see that.  And it is -- it's a lesson  to people when you invest in a company, a stock that has a really high  valuation on it, you better be in for the long haul.  You could lose -- if  you're going to sell today you could lose 28 percent of whatever you put in  yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"Journal\" story was great, going through the tick tock of  the conference call and sort of what, you know, Sheryl Sandberg said versus  Mark Zuckerberg versus the CFO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg saying Instagram has been this amazing success and  highlighting.  And then Sheryl Sandberg comes on and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- everything.  Yes, \"The Lego Movie\", \"everything is awesome\".   And then the CFO comes on.  Leave it to the money guy to be fair  (INAUDIBLE) and go, well, I've got a couple of bombs I'm about to drop on  you,\" 20 minutes into this conference call. .  It's not funny.  It's not  funny.</p><p>But there were a lot of problem areas that the finance chief highlighted.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that certainly is setting the tone for technology this  morning.  Facebook right now down 20 percent.</p><p>And then there's this, Trump talking tariffs.  President Trump off to  Illinois this morning to talk workforce development and tour a steel  factory that's reopened as a result of his tariff regulations.</p><p>Just in the last hour I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who  touted the President's tough stance on steel and aluminum tariffs.  Here's  what he told me this morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  So steel and aluminum, there's no  intention to abandon those industries.  So the President is very happy with  the progress they have made in opening new facilities.   I'm joining him  today as we go out to visit one that had just recently been reopened.  He's  not going to do anything to destroy steel and aluminum from their new-found  substance.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet, it's a double edged sword.  Both Coca-Cola and General  Motors will be raising prices they say on their iconic products in large  part because of the fallout over tariffs.</p><p>Joining me right now is Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz.  He is former deputy  secretary of Defense, former ambassador to Indonesia and former assistant  secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.  Ambassador -- good  to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be here -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Secretary Ross' notion that the steel and  aluminum tariffs are remaining intact.  The markets rallied hugely last  night on this idea that the E.U. and the U.S. are going to work toward no  tariffs but we know that the aluminum and steel tariffs are still in place.  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  And I think they're hurting some of our best friends including  Japan pretty badly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your thoughts on this strategy that the President has.  You  know, he comes into this saying ok, we lost $151 billion with the E.U.  We  lost you know, $500 billion with China.  We want a more level playing  field.</p><p>And do you think this is all a negotiation, that at the end of the day  maybe the U.S. comes out in a better place as it seems like the markets are  viewing this?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly hope so because there's no question, we need  a more level playing field.  But we could end up with a very, very rocky  one instead if this escalates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the President and the European Commission president Mr.  Juncker yesterday came out very positive and discussed that they are going  to have a breakthrough in trade talks to avoid a transatlantic trade war.   The two leaders agreeing to hold off on further tariffs signaling a pause  in the President's auto tariff threat.  Ambassador -- could zero tariffs  with Europe become a reality in your view?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It will certainly surprise me if it happens but it would be a  good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is your take in terms of what's happening in terms of a  cease fire when it comes to China?  President Xi issuing a stark threat to  President Trump claiming that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.</p><p>Your reaction to President Xi's comments?  What does yesterday's deal  between the U.S. and Europe mean for China?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  I think it puts more pressure on China.  And the issue with  China is not so much about the tariffs although they're relevant.  But the  real issue with China is the way it's been stealing intellectual property  here, not only by forcing companies to reveal what they have but also by  cyber methods, breaking into corporate secrets.  I think it's a very, very  dangerous trend that they've been on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  And I think it's good to be opposing them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're glad in terms of the pushback from America to China  in terms of the consistent theft of intellectual property?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  If it doesn't get out of control -- but my sense is from Xi's  comments is he's much more worried about where it could go than we are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Ambassador, let me move on to the President's bilateral meeting with  Vladimir Putin.  National security adviser John Bolton citing special  counsel Robert Mueller's investigation for a delay issuing this statement.   \"The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President  Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over.  So we've  agreed that it will be after the first of the year.\"</p><p>How do you expect the U.S. policy toward Russia moving forward and any  thoughts on the President's foreign policy decisions?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You know, one of the ironies here is that Putin has obviously  succeeded in sowing enormous dissension in the United States over our own  political process which is one of his goals.  But he's actually ended up  with a Russia policy that is probably much tougher than he might have had  otherwise and may even get tougher still.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that -- then, I guess that's a positive in your  view?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Positive that the meeting's postponed?  Absolutely.  But what I  would like to see more talk about is measures like this Magnitsky Act that  put pressure on Russian plutocrats to make it much more difficult for them  to hide their money here and to launder it.</p><p>And the British (INAUDIBLE) something called the unexplained wealth orders  which are now putting a lot of pressure on probably Russians, but maybe  other people as well, who are buying expensive property in London through  offshore shell companies to hide it.  That's a real threat to Putin and his  clique.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  That's why he's apparently going after Bill  Browder, who of course, it was Bill Browder's lawyer Mr. Magnitsky who was  killed in jail and he was able to get the Magnitsky Act.</p><p>Let me ask you about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday testifying in  front of the Senate foreign relations committee facing a barrage of  questions aimed at U.S. policy on Russia and on North Korea.  Pompeo vowed  that the U.S. will not relax sanctions towards Russia but said that we  cannot make progress with Moscow unless we're open to discussions.  Listen  to this clip from yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  President Trump believes the two  great nuclear powers should not have a contentious relationship.  This is  not just in our interest but in the interest of the whole world.</p><p>He strongly believes that now is the time for direct communication in our  relationship in order to make clear to President Putin that there is the  possibility, however remote it might be, to reverse the negative course of  our relationship.  Otherwise, the administration will continue imposing  tough actions against Russia in response to its malign activities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ambassador, it looked like Mr. Pompeo did well yesterday.   Anything strike you from that testimony?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly agree with that second part of keeping up the  pressure.</p><p>I mean it's worth noting, Maria, that when President Reagan was negotiating  with the old Soviet Union, he didn't let up the pressure on Poland which  was one of their weak spots.  And even more impressively when he was  working closely with General Secretary Gorbachev to get an arms control  agreement that was very important to everybody he made that famous  statement about \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"  So he kept the  pressure up in Berlin.</p><p>I think the only way you get anywhere with people like Putin is by having  pressure on them.  If you just try to do it by being nice it never works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Ambassador -- it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, bitcoin is bouncing back.  The  cryptocurrency jumping above $8,000 for the first time in two months.   What's behind the recent gains -- coming up.</p><p>Then Twitter's shadow ban -- why some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fallout, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news -- two police officers killed in the line of duty.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWOR CORRESPONDENT:  We're getting some new  details, Maria, on this breaking news.  This happened in Milwaukee.  A 17- year police veteran was shot and killed by a suspect who was wanted on gun  and drug violations.  They do have that suspect in custody now.  A  procession of officers escorted the fallen officer's body to the medical  examiner's office.  Look at these incredible pictures.</p><p>This is the second death of a Milwaukee police officer just this summer.   What a show of support.</p><p>Meanwhile in Arizona, one officer was shot and killed and the other was  injured.  This happened last night there.  The officers responding to a  call about a man driving erratically on the roads.</p><p>Well, New York is keeping its promise to 9/11 victims' families 17 years  later.  Through improved DNA testing the medical examiner's office has  identified the 1,642nd victim of that terror attack.</p><p>Scott Michael Johnson was 26 years old.  He was working for the investment  banking firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.  He was on the 89th floor of the  South Tower.  The bone belonging to Johnson had been tested dozens of times  throughout the years but recent improvements allowed examiners to gain  enough DNA evidence to make that match.  Johnson -- the first victim to be  identified since august of last year.</p><p>Well, Mattel is cutting costs and they're cutting jobs.  The company  slashing 2,200 jobs as they continue to struggle with falling sales after  reporting weak and unexpected quarterly results.  Mattel, which is of  course, well-known for making Barbie and Hot Wheels, also hurt by the  closing of Toys R Us which happened recently this year.  Shares of Mattel,  Maria, are trading lower in the premarket -- ok, a lot lower, down by 11  percent.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big move there, cutting 2,200 jobs and the stock takes a hit.</p><p>CASONE:  Which is -- usually it's the opposite we see.  That's not good for  that company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, bitcoin bouncing back this morning, the cryptocurrency jumping  above 8,000 for the first time in two months.  What's behind that big gain,  coming up. </p><p>Then, no such thing as a free lunch, right.  Why San Francisco is now  looking to ban free cafeterias at technology companies -- one of the best  perks there is.</p><p>Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Bitcoin optimism is back.  The cryptocurrency reaching over $8,000 a token  for the first time since May.  Ripple chief market strategist Cory Johnson  joins us now to talk more about that.  Cory -- it's great to see you.  </p><p>CORY JOHNSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RIPPLE:  Good to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What do you make of this  recent move higher on bitcoin?  And tell us how you see the overall market?   Because you're really much more bullish on XRP as opposed to bitcoin.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  Well, I think -- I think for us, you know, Ripple has based  some of our software solutions on XRP because we think it's a better  technology.  We look at XRP as sort of block chain 2.0.</p><p>The bitcoin is a fascinating idea but it's really sort of breaking down in  terms of its ability to use it, closing transaction is really slow.  We're  looking at a business problem.  And the business problem is moving money  across borders.</p><p>It is crazy that today I can send a text message to a friend in Rome with  emojis and a gif of falling down and clever stuff and I can send an Excel  spreadsheet by e-mail to South Africa in 3 seconds.  But if I want to move  money from New York to Mexico City it takes five days and costs over 500  basis points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's crazy in this era of technology.  So Ripple has created a  bunch of software products to really accelerate that process, to move money  in less than a minute and for, you know, just basis points.  But using XRP  as a basis technology for some of the software solutions we can move it so  much cheaper and so much more efficiently using XRP.  We think that XRP  will have great value over time.  </p><p>BELL:  What about consumers?  Mastercard just applied for a patent to be  able to use cryptocurrencies on credit cards.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  Is that the future of currencies?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I mean we are 100 percent focused on business.  I mean I think  that there will be lots of better ways for money to move but again, when  you talk about moving money, bitcoin's slow.  Ether is slow.  XRP moves  really, really fast just because of the way the technology is a little bit  different.</p><p>I don't want to give you the technological details but fundamentally money  should move as fast as ideas move as fast as data moves.  And right now it  doesn't.  And it's really expensive.</p><p>The place that money hurts -- that slow-moving money hurts people is moving  money across borders.  If you are working and your family is in another  country, if you're on vacation in another country, if you're a business and  you want to buy products in another country to sell it where you are, it  takes so long to move money and costs so much money.</p><p>Imagine if your business is selling (ph) with 500 basis points -- the World  Bank says it's a 532-basis point cost to move money across borders for  anyone.  That's a horrible drag on business.  We're trying to fix that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory hurdles and head winds country by  country in terms of are they rising because again, we talk about no borders  in terms of virtual currencies but there are borders and regulators love to  make sure that even in the digital world that those borders exist.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Look, one person's regulation is another person's protection.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I believe it's really important for investors to be protected.   We've seen what happens when there aren't investor protections.  We've seen  investors lose so much money.  And we've seen it in the world of crypto.   We've seen some real bad actors involved.</p><p>So we're thrilled that regulators are getting involved.  It's really  interesting.  It's not what I expected when I joined this company say six  months ago and we're very much engaged in conversations with regulators.</p><p>But I'll say that a lot of other countries are moving faster than the U.S.  to try to provide really clear lanes of where business can act, what's  right and what's wrong.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like China.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, China's a really peculiar case.  Most of the bitcoin  mining, most of the ether mining is all taking place in places where power  is cheap, which is China; and where they've got the access to the best  computer chips, which is China.  And so China -- most bitcoin is mined in  China.  Most ether is mined in China.</p><p>XRP isn't being mined.  It was pre-mined, if you will.  So as a result it  uses virtually no power when it's, you know, compared to these other  things.  Running a node in the network is so much cheaper as a result.  And  there isn't any mining cost with that.  So it's a different kind of  technology as a result.</p><p>But countries like Singapore, countries like Switzerland, countries like  Thailand are working really hard to make sure that businesses develop there  around block chain.  The U.S. is starting to do some things.  The SEC has  started to try to figure some things out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But other countries aren't waiting and the entrepreneurs aren't  waiting to start business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  really exciting opportunity.</p><p>Cory -- thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  It's so good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You, too.  Great to have you -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We've known you a lot of years -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  We're not that old?  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we're not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're still innovating.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Go figure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cory Johnson.</p><p>Coming up, Twitter's shadow ban -- some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fall out coming next.</p><p>And then fighting free lunches -- why two San Francisco lawmakers are  trying to do away with free cafeterias at Silicon Valley technology  companies.  The story coming up.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top stories right now,  07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Facebook unfriended by investors this morning, take a look at the stock,  plummeting better than 20 percent.  The company taking a hit after  reporting disappointing sales and revenue guidance, the conference call had  lots of expectations and they fell short.  </p><p>It is just the tip of the iceberg for technology.  We've got Amazon and  Intel reporting this afternoon, those are the two to watch today.  Amazon  with some high expectations there, going into the quarter down 1-3/4  percent going in to the numbers.  </p><p>Futures this morning, indicating a mix opening.  The Dow Industrials are up  36 points right now but the NASDAQ is down 58 points as technology takes a  hit on the Facebook news.  </p><p>The markets ending the day yesterday higher.  Tensions over trade disputes  between the U.S. and the E.U. ease as the president spoke with the European  Commission President Mr. Juncker and said they are going to work toward an  agreement toward zero tariffs.  Markets rallied on that.  Dow Industrials  finished up 172 points.  The NASDAQ was up 91.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, money is moving into  stocks.  The DAX Index up better than one percent.  No real agreement on  autos and yet the DAX Index in Germany quite strong today, up better than  one percent.  CAC Quarante up quarter of a percent.  The FT-100 unchanged  as the European markets await the European Central Bank news this morning.  </p><p>Asian markets closing mostly in the red overnight.  Take a look, the KOSPI  was up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>President Trump on Twitter declaring a big day for free and fair trade  after his meeting with the European Commission president.  The president  said that the goal would be zero tariffs.  I spoke with U.S. Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier this morning to get his take.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY, U.S. COMMERCE:  Well, you notice on light trucks,  there was an exception for automotive products.  It said we'd work towards  zero tariffs on nonautomotive industrial products.  Steel and aluminum,  there's no attention to abandon those industries.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Twitter accused of hiding conservative voices in the  search results at the company.  The company taking heat this morning for  so-called \"shadow banning.\"  We will tell you all about it with the details  coming up.  </p><p>Then, local businesses are up in arms in San Francisco over free lunches at  technology companies.  They want to force workers to pay up, leave campus  to get food and pay for it.  The controversy, coming up.  </p><p>We're in the middle of the summer blockbuster season where there are big  movies, there is IMAX.  We are checking in to see surprises the company's  got in store for movie goers.  We'll check in with the IMAX CEO on earnings  and what's ahead.  </p><p>All that coming up, but first, Facebook shares, falling out of bed this  morning, that's for sure.  The stock down 20 percent on news from the  company's earnings report which basically opened up the idea that growth is  slowing down at Facebook as they invest more in security and privacy tools.  </p><p>Joining us right now on the telephone is Arete senior analyst Richard  Kramer.  Richard, great to have you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.   Your reaction to the Facebook news yesterday?  </p><p>RICHARD KRAMER, SENIOR ANALYST, ARETE (via telephone):  Well, I think we  had already had a growth slowdown from extremely high levels in our  numbers.  I don't think that was a big surprise.  The biggest surprise was  that Facebook is extremely happy to continue spending the kind of money it  does, both on cap-ex, on staff growth, on buybacks and so forth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- I mean, when you look at the kind of growth numbers that  we've been accustomed to at Facebook, 30 percent revenue growth, are those  days now in the rear view mirror?  Is that the issue here that we're not  going to see the kind of growth that we expected in the past?  </p><p>KRAMER:  I think you need to put this in the context of the law of large  numbers.  And Facebook ended last year at a $40 billion company.  And  finding an incremental 50 percent growth on top of that, which is the clip  that they were running at last year, is -- you know, finding another $20  billion of advertising revenue and that's just simply a very hard to do.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Richard, Lindsey Bell here.   Interesting, revenue per user was actually up, which I thought was kind of  a highlight, if you could find one.  But the real question we've talked  about all morning is Instagram, this is supposed to be the growth engine  for the company going forward.  How are they going to monetize it?  They've  kind of lagged there.  What do you see going forward with that?  </p><p>KRAMER:  I mean, Instagram is incredibly powerful platform.  And if you  look at brand like, Nike, that has 80 million followers on Instagram, where  else will it be able to tap into a global audience to directly market its  products to?  I wouldn't be overly concerned about that transition.  That's  something that we've written about earlier this year.  I think there's also  another important narrative which is Facebook is desperate to avoid  regulation, by showing -- saying that they're going to invest more and show  lower margins, they're creating a sort of oh, woe is me narrative around  the stock that hopefully will keep for them regulators at day.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Richard, it's Dagen McDowell  on Instagram, it's not the feeds per say and the ad revenue that that pulls  in, it was the ad revenue generated on the Instagram stories because  Facebook has predicted that activity on those stories, those photos and  videos that disappear after 24 hours, would eclipse the time spent just  scrolling through feeds next year.  How can they better monetize the ads  that are -- and activity in Instagram stories.  What do you expect them to  do?  </p><p>KRAMER:  Well, I think what you're -- I think what you're pointing out is  that story's clearly is a new format and they're transitioning to it and  they're willing to take the pain clearly as a company with $42 billion of  cash.  They can absorb quite a bit of that pain.  I think you have to give  them some time.  Because the next thing that will clearly be coming on  Instagram is shoppable icons that -- it will turn into -- rapidly turn into  an e-commerce platform alongside stories.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of directions they can take Instagram.  The focus right  now is on this transition to stories.  But that overlooks a whole range of  other options that they have with the platform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you buy the stock right here at 173 and change?  </p><p>KRAMER:  Well, we're obviously not supposed to talk about our ratings on  the air but we are -- we have a -- we have a positive view on the stock.  I  don't think that -- I don't think Facebook's days are completely over  because they're planning to spend more money.  I think if you look out  three, five years, and ask yourself will the platforms that they have still  be as relevant?  It's main Facebook may not be as relevant but Instagram  may be a lot more relevant.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Richard, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining the conversation this morning.  </p><p>KRAMER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard Kramer joining us.  </p><p>Turning now to Twitter being under fire.  The social media company facing  backlash for reportedly restricting the visibility of top Republicans, but  not Democrats, in its search results.  The technique is called shadow  banning.  And according to the Vice News, people like RNC Chair Ronna  McDaniel do not appear in Twitter's auto populated dropdown search box on  the site.  </p><p>McDaniel twitted about it yesterday writing this, the notion that social  media companies could suppress certain political points of view should  concern every American.  Twitter owns the public -- owes the public answers  to what's really going on.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Caldwell Strategic Consulting founder and Fox News  political analyst Gianno Caldwell.  Gianno, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  What do you think is going on?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this, Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, I mean, this comes as no surprise to me and many other  conservatives.  You think about what happened with Diamond and Silk with  (INAUDIBLE) members of congress being impacted by Facebook and other social  media networks who don't like the political speech of conservatives, it's  fairly problematic.  We've seen hearings on this on Capitol Hill.  I think  that it's now time for members of congress to take a deeper look and begin  to put regulations on these companies that do this, that really try to  interfere with the equitable actions of every American.  </p><p>So, whereas as you can be Louis Farrakhan and not be shadow banned or  impacted in any way, who obviously uses forms of hate speech or you can be  Madonna and threaten the president of the United States in ways.  These  individuals still have a social media presence that's glowing for their  viewers.  </p><p>So, why is it that conservatives who talk about being pro life, who talk  about other capitalism, why is it that they're being shadow banned?  This  is problematic on many levels and it's something that congress must take a  deeper look, a heightened look, I think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know when we had Kevin McCarthy on and other Republican  congressmen, they all said that -- you know, you don't want necessarily the  government to come in and start being big government on companies, right?   I don't think anybody wants that because we are in a free market.  What you  would like to see is competition come in and we'll see if this leads to  that.  Because, obviously, there's an issue here.  If Twitter is going to  censor conservative ideas.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One issue is -- and that's why Facebook is spending so much  money on privacy, that's why they're dedicating themselves to improving the  protections on the platform.  And they've been accused of censor --  obviously, censoring conservative content as well.  </p><p>But that's -- but they understand the danger of regulation.  Or they're  beginning to understand that.  </p><p>But in terms of the problem that you expressed with Ronna McDaniel, it's  still apparent, like this is something that Twitter could fix in  spontaneously.  If you put the name Ronna in the search, Ronna's got a  verified Twitter account.  But instead, the first results, if you put Ronna  in, you get somebody who has a verified account with a few thousand  followers, not 85,000 like Ronna McDaniel.  You get somebody with a  verified account with a few hundred.  </p><p>And by the way, I follow a lot of conservatives on Twitter and they follow  me back but they're not giving me that search result.  That's something  that Twitter could easily fix and so far they haven't done it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they haven't.  </p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  So, Gianno, this is Jack Brewer.  What  can influencers do, conservative minded influencers, what can we do to  really push forward this messaging?  Because at the end of the day, these  social media companies are dependent upon influencers.  That's where people  are going, that's who they're following.  And so, you know, I'm just trying  to figure out, come up with an idea on what steps we can take to make our  voices bigger?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, interestingly enough, I think especially when it comes  to the shadow banning issue, there's been a lot of folks that have spoken  up.  That's the reason why we had those big hearings on Capitol Hill.  You  saw Diamond and Silk actually on Capitol Hill in a hearing where we had  this discussion.  Many of these social media companies have said that they  were taking steps to correct this.  But you continue to see the same issue  pop up time and time again.  </p><p>When we have the president of the United States who's a -- the biggest  government leader using this service.  And we know that there's other  government leaders who've been shadow banned as well, members of congress,  that's when it's necessities.</p><p>In my view, of course, we don't like regulation, competition is great, but  this is something that the government is fully using.  This is a -- this is  a spear where public dialogue is happening on a regular basis.  So yes,  it's great to have competition but it will take a while before competition  is able to compete with that kind of search profile, these social media  sites.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  So, yes, this is the time I think that we should be going in and  talking about listen, if you're not going to correct this, you made claims  time and time again, there should be some form of a penalty because there's  voices that are seriously being silenced.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quick, Jack Dorsey has been meeting privately a lot  of conservative thought leaders and having a lot of discussions.  But that  talk needs to turn into a walk in terms of the policies and the way that  Twitter is actually managed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it hasn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has not.  Gianno, good to get your insight.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Gianno Caldwell there.</p><p>Coming up, no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, why San Francisco  is now looking to ban free lavish cafeterias at technology companies, one  of the best perks for tech workers, that story coming up.  </p><p>Then, pump up the volume.  We are going deeper into the ultimate high  quality movie going experience with the CEO of IMAX, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A move to ban free lunches at technology company  cafeterias in an attempt to support local restaurants.  Gerri Willis with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right.  If you are one of the thousands of San Francisco workers used to  enjoying a free lunch every day at work, get ready for a change.  The  city's Board of Supervisors wants to ban the free lunch, saying it hurts  local restaurants.  Look, even the restaurants say they can't compete.  </p><p>Free lunches are a perk at big tech companies and offered by the likes of  Google, Twitter, but also Levi Strauss.  That's an old one.  There are 51  such employee cafeterias in San Francisco.  One supporter of the law  banning in house cafeterias said this \"We don't want employees biking or  driving to their office, staying there all day and going home.  This is  about getting people out of their office.\"</p><p>However, if the law is passive and only applied a new companies putting a  cafeteria is not existing once.  Well, the proposals in usual, it's not  without president.  Nearby Mountain View, California barred Facebook from  subsidizing on-site meals for 2,000 workers for the tech company offices.   Says one San Francisco restaurant to -- restaurant tour that it's hard to  compete with free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what?  I mean, companies are allowed to offer their  employees whatever they want.  I mean, this is basically to me big  government telling companies how to do their business.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Or just mouthy small government, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  It's a board of supervisors here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, a board of supervisors.  Local city supervisors telling  technology companies how to pay their employees.  That's a perk that  companies have a right to give.  </p><p>BREWER:  And what about the food service companies, right?  They're most  the -- most of them are outsourcing us.  So you have you know, major food  service companies now that are going to be losing contracts and it makes no  sense.  Another thing, why don't they just charge them a quarter, come eat  a full meal, a quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's good.  Then the local restaurants will have to  compete with that.  </p><p>BREWER:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why, I can't figure out why some of these companies haven't  moved to more free market cities?  I know that all the talent is in Silicon  Valley and in San Francisco.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, they have moved south, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And some of them have moved to Texas which is a no income tax  state, maybe even -- I know, I think Zappos is based in Las Vegas, of all  places.  But that's owned by Amazon.  </p><p>But I'll point out, again, it's because these bureaucrats think they know  better --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- than people who have created some of the greatest companies  in the history of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why they're getting the (INAUDIBLE) that they're  getting.  Because they got all these perks.  So what?  They're allowed.  </p><p>WILLIS:  What if you're an employee of one of these companies and city hall  saying we're going to take this away from you.  I would really be pissed.   Is this really going to help them?  I don't think so.  This is exactly like  the big debate three years ago over busses, Google busses.  Local groups  complained hey, this is texploitation.  They're there ganking up major  arteries in the city. </p><p>By the way, it was free to the city to transport Google employees.  They  didn't have to pay for city busses --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>WILLIS:  -- to get people anywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  I think we all agree.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Listen, I lived in San Francisco --</p><p>BELL:  Keep out of the business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for less than a year and I hated it for that very reason.  </p><p>WILLIS:  We were there at the same time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we we're there at the same --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  City officials -- City officials trying to tell businesses how  to run their businesses.  Gerri, thank you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of technology, President Trump is just tweeting this,  he says this, Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.  </p><p>Yes, we were just talking about this, obviously.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, blockbusters on the big, big screen.</p><p>I'm talking to the CEO of IMAX next hour about his company's high quality  theater experience and summer movie going surprises.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a clip, that was a clip from \"Mission: Impossible- Fallout\".  The sixth installment of the wildly successful franchise of  \"Mission Impossible\".  The Tom Cruise led blockbuster is the latest IMAX  offering.  It hit screens nationwide tomorrow -- tonight.  </p><p>IMAX meanwhile, reporting second quarter earnings last night in earnings  per share $00.30 on 98.3 million revenue.  EPS beating expectations with  revenue narrowly missing expectations.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of IMAX, Richard Gelfond.  Richard, it's  great to see you.  </p><p>RICHARD GELFOND, CEO, IMAX:  Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GELFOND:  I'm happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good quarter.  </p><p>GELFOND:  Very good quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What drove the quarter?  </p><p>GELFOND:  Well, first of all, the second quarter was the highest box office  quarter in the history of the movie business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>GELFOND:  Somewhat surprising, people think it's somewhat stagnant industry  but it's actually still growing.  And IMAX's case, what we do is global  blockbusters.  So, a large majority of our revenues were international.  We  did over $100 million in China in box office, over $100 million  domestically and over $100 million in the rest of the world.  We were  firing on all cylinders.  I think the public has an appetite for these  blockbusters in a premium way and that's where IMAX's fits.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's really important information that you're giving us.   Because the international story is such an important growth story for so  many companies, IMAX included.  You haven't been caught up in this tariff  fight with China.  </p><p>GELFOND:  No, we haven't.  You know, I don't think we will either.  And  some of the reasons for that, Maria, are it's been a very good relationship  between Hollywood and China.  So Hollywood's made a lot of money exporting  its films to China.  We have a separate public company in China that's  worth over $1 billion, a big business.  We do a big part of the Chinese box  office.  And for the Chinese, they're portrayed in a different way than  they were years ago.  </p><p>So, they're not the bad guys anymore and they're not -- you know, the  communist enemies.  They're portrayed, you look at movies like \"The  Martian\" or you look at movies like \"The Great Wall\", in a very favorable  way.  So, I don't think China wants to poke an eye at Hollywood right now.   I don't think that works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you have to give up any of your technology, did you have to  give up any of the secrets of IMAX in order to get your company -- you  know, in a foothold in China?  </p><p>GELFOND:  We didn't.  And we didn't -- initially, we didn't grow with  Chinese partners.  We did it ourselves.  On the other hand though, we had  an ugly episode about seven or eight years ago where someone, a former  employee stole some of our technology and they were backed by the Chinese  government.  And it was drawn out.  </p><p>So, you know, I think the government has something there when they talk  about protecting the theft of I.P.  And I think China's a real world power  now.  They're not a disrupter.  They're the status quo.  They have more  engineers than anyone graduating in the world.  And I think they have to be  part of the world community and protect I.P.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The best part of IMAX is the experience.  That's why you're  seeing the growth you are in Saudi Arabia.  In China you're looking at  building and expanding, throughout the Middle East.  </p><p>Tell us what's on top in terms of the big movies and also what you're  expecting in terms of the Middle East and where the growth comes from next.  </p><p>GELFOND:  Well, Saudi Arabia is a promising market.  It just opened up to  cinema a few months ago.  And we are the second theater -- commercial  theater ever in Saudi Arabia with Vox, AMC opened the first commercial  theater there.  India's a very big growth market for us now.  We have -- I  think, 35 theaters in the Middle East today.  They love the Western movies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, fantastic.  </p><p>GELFOND:  \"Black Panther\" played amazing in the Middle East.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That did very well.  And I know you have \"Aqua Man\" coming up,  you've got the Fantastics.  </p><p>GELFOND:  \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Ant-Man\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, you're going to be our special guest this weekend in  Wall Street.  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  Richard -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  July 26th. END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  Facebook unfriended on Wall Street.  Take a look  at the stock plunging on disappointing sales and revenue guidance.  Nearly  $150 billion wiped out of market value in the after-hours trading session  for Facebook. </p><p>The stock is down better than 20 percent right now.  That sell-off setting  the tone for the rest of the technology sector.  The biggest names in tech  under pressure this morning.  Amazon will report after the close going into  the numbers.  The stock is down 1-1/4 percent.  Twitter and Snap both down  better than three percent.  Broader markets this morning mixed.  Take a  look at futures indicating a gain to the Dow, but a loss for the NASDAQ.   Dow Industrials up 44 points right now. </p><p>S&amp;P 500 is down five and the NASDAQ down 52 points.  That's by the way is  off of the lows of the morning down three quarters of a percent on NASDAQ.   It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday in the final 30 minutes of  trading.  We had a huge surge on reports of a softening trade dispute  between the U.S. and the E.U.  President Trump and European Commission  President Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to  negotiate a trade deal. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The European Union is going  to start almost immediately to buy a lot of soybeans.  They're a tremendous  market buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers.  These will open markets for  farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in  both the United States and the European Union. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a look at the key issues at stake this morning  coming up.  Checking global markets this morning, Europe is mixed.  The  European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged.  That was expected.   But investors are waiting on ECB President Mario DraghI's news conference  that happens later this hour.  We are looking for guidance on rising rates  and the end of stimulus there.  CAC Quarante is up a quarter of a percent. </p><p>DAX Index in German up one and a quarter percent this morning.  In Asia  overnight, markets are mostly lower.  As you can see there, China was the  weakest.  The Shanghai Composite down three quarters of a percent.  And  explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  The only person injured was  the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We have the very latest on  that investigation coming up.  And Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones standing firm  in his support for the national anthem. </p><p>He says all players will be required to stand.  Plus, the end of an era.   The new owner of Necco Wafers shutting down a factory.  What it means for  your candy favorites coming up.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, former NFL star and The Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer, and CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  A really big show today guys with lot  of news.  Good morning. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  A lot of news and it looks like  I've been just walking the bottom of the screen.  A lot of earnings coming  out of beatings, so I like that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McDonald's the latest beating earnings estimates in terms of  earnings and revenue. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the news out of the White  House with meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker from Europe was certainly a  relief to investors.  You saw what the market did yesterday.  It's a de- escalation of the trade fight at least starting with Europe, an important  trading partner, a tariff truce, maybe no new tariffs say on automobiles.   That will be good news.  But, again, I think it goes to Steve Forbes'  point.  You saw the market reaction.  If we weren't having this trade fight  in some way, the market would be higher than it is already. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.  And last night, you know, we know that the  steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place, but they've agreed that  there won't be additional tariffs right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  While they work out a broader trade deal that Europe also  agreeing to buy more soybeans that will help offset at least some of the  pain from that fight that we've got into that we've entered into with  China.  And also it looks like natural gas.  Again, you -- that goes a huge  way to offsetting the power that Russia is trying to claim. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And right now they have an outline of all this going.  They're  going to turn this into an agreement apparently.  Joining the conversation  this morning Energy Secretary Rick Perry is joining us today to talk about  that in terms of what kind of business can be done between the E.U. and  America when it comes to energy, South Dakota Congresswoman Kristi Noem is  with us this morning, along with Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star Pitcher, Ross  Stripling is here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney weighs in  as well. </p><p>Big show ahead.  Don't miss it.  And we kick it off right here with this  top story.  And Facebook slide bringing down all the big technology names  this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange looking at the market that is watching tick slow down, Nic. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Absolutely.  Good morning,  Maria.  So when we're watching Facebook dragging down all the tech stocks  dragging down ETF's and while we see the Dow up more than 40 points.  Good  news on tariffs talk.  But ultimately, this is going to weigh.  Let's break  this down.  So when you talk about what you saw in Facebook and when I was  talking to the analyst this morning, Joe Collina, over at Wedbush. </p><p>You see it's down 20 percent, OK.  This basically takes Facebook from  record territory yesterday into bear market territory, and missed on  everything, revenues, daily active users, monthly active users, cash on  operations, advertising guidance, and guidance.  OK.  With that what really  wild Wall Street in a negative way.  It was first (INAUDIBLE) Sandberg and  then the CFO David Winger comes on, and basically gives the outlook.  And  what really led Joe Collina to be really surprised is that he feels that  there are serious credibility issues with this management lying to  investors. </p><p>We were told there would be no impact from privacy.  And in fact, that is  not the case.  In fact, you heard from David Weiner saying that the outlook  would fall significantly and he said that the outlook is somewhat severe.   There are others who are still positive in rating the stock just fine.  But  this is a sell-off and it will drag all the other social media and ETFs  down along with it.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hi, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides looking into  market that will opening mixed this morning.  In just about an hour,  President Trump will leave to talk workforce optimism in the Midwest.  This  as some U.S. companies say that the steel and aluminum tariffs will hurt  more than they will help.  Earlier, I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The impact of steel and  aluminum on the auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about  one percent on the cost of the vehicle.  So to the degree that that might  be passed along, that's possible. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake Burman is live at the White House with the very latest.   Here and, Blake, what a reaction to the president's press conference with  Mr. Juncker yesterday? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  And we  all hear from the president later today, Maria, as he is set to leave the  White House here later this hour.  He's on the road two stops today, Iowa  and to Illinois, and it is at that second stop where the president will  indeed give a speech on trade and, of course, comes one day after the  president hosted the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude  Juncker here at the White House for two and a half hours. </p><p>That meeting culminated with an impromptu semi-press conference I guess you  could say in the Rose Garden yesterday in which those two essentially said  that they are going to try to avert a trade war.  The E.U. says it will buy  more soybeans from the U.S. for example while the president suggested that  he is willing to back off steel and aluminum tariffs for the E.U. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We also will resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues and we  will resolve retaliatory tariffs.  We have some tariffs that are  retaliatory and that will get resolve this part of what we're doing. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Now, companies as you know are citing the steel and aluminum  tariffs as a major headwind.  Yesterday alone for example, Coca-Cola  announced that it will raise prices in North America while G.M., Ford, and  FiatChrysler all lowered profit forecasts for the year all citing tariffs.   Now, just before the president and Jean-Claude Juncker met here at the  White House to try to lower the volume if nothing else on this back-and- forth emerging trade tit-for-tat. </p><p>The Chinese President Xi Jinping weighed in a speech yesterday.  This was  his warning.  He said, \"A trade war should be rejected because there will  be no winner.\"  Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us now to talk more about that is South Dakota  Congresswoman Kristi Noem, a member of the House on Ways and Means  Committee who attended a trade meeting with the president yesterday at the  White House.  Congresswoman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us. </p><p>REP. KRISTI NOEM (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Thank you for having me on today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what we have from the European leader and  President Trump in terms of this agreement.  They're calling it an outline,  not an out-and-out agreement. </p><p>NOEM:  Well, it was a good day yesterday and a great announcement for the  farmers in South Dakota, the farmers across this country that Europe is  going to immediately begin buying soybeans which is a new market for us  that has opened up that we can get more of a -- of a market to sell across  the globe.  So I think that is a good indication of what can happen as we  continue to talk to other countries.  This president has been aggressive  and making sure that we have more fair agreements, and bringing people to  the table to make sure that it is beneficial not only for farmers and  ranchers. </p><p>But for all of those involved in industries that have been struggling, and  from decades of unfair treatment. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But just to be clear, the aluminum and steel tariffs are still  in place and it is impacting the growth story and the number of  corporations. </p><p>NOEM:  It is.  You know, we certainly saw a lot of growth and we still  continue to see growth.  In fact, I think we'll have good numbers tomorrow  when they're released.  But, you know, these tariffs have brought people to  the table.  We have had years of unfair treatment.  I think that the  president is keeping his eye on the ball by making sure that he's breaking  down those barriers and getting people to give us better treatment across  the globe. </p><p>And, you know, he said yesterday to us clearly in the -- in the cabinet  room that he doesn't like tariffs.  But he's going to use them to make sure  that we're treated fairly in the future. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, who's next?  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  Who's next  in terms of because again this is still a deal in Europe that has to be  worked out with the more than two dozen nations across the whole of Europe  and in Germany and France have very different goals in terms of trade with  the United States, who's next?  Will it be Mexico?  Will it be a bilateral  deal, a full reworking of NAFTA?  And how soon will we see that? </p><p>NOEM:  You know, I spent a lot of time working on trade since I've been in  Congress and we've had great briefings the last couple of weeks with the  trade ambassador, with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue who's been aggressive in  recognizing how our farmers and ranchers need to get through this difficult  time.  We've had great discussions with the White House.  I think that  these agreements will start to come more rapidly now, now that we've seen  European come and give us a better playing field and give us another market  for soybeans that Mexico could be next. </p><p>When Mexico comes to an agreement with us in the next 30 to 60 days which  is what I'm hoping for.  That brings Canada in with better faith, efforts  than what they've demonstrated so far, so the news is positive.  And we're  going the right direction and that's what I've appreciated is this  president is by far our best negotiator that we've seen in decades.  He has  recognized the problem and the reason that farmers and ranchers are in a  tough situation today is because we've been living through four to five  years of record low commodity prices because previous administration didn't  care to have this fight. </p><p>This president is wanting to break down those barriers and get fair  agreements for us, open up new markets for our farmer and ranchers and  that's what's he's doing through all of these negotiation tactics. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined this morning and said  tariffs are starting to have effect on China in fact.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSS:  You see these repeated announcements coming out of China things that  they're doing with the banking system, bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.  Clearly they're feeling pressure from the tariffs that the  president has put on. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of pressure there, congresswoman.  But is it  going to be enough to actually change China's behavior, the thief of  intellectual property, the forced transfer of technology?  </p><p>NOEM:  I believe it will.  We've seen that when they have come back against  us by us forcing them to have more open-handed discussions with us, they  have come back in very politically motivated ways to try to punish our  farmer and ranchers.  They have been targeted in how they've gone after the  United States, and that shows that they recognize how important this fight  is, and how unfair they've been to us for decades.  So this president has  gone to bat for business and businesses and people and families across the  country by giving us tax reform, by giving us relief from regulations that  we're burdening our economy. </p><p>Now, he's fighting for more markets and more fair agreements.  This is  something that we need to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that we're  bringing people to the table, and making China give us a better open  agreement than what we've had in the past.  The trade deficit we've had  with China has been unacceptable for a long time and this president  recognizes that it needs to be rectified. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the other deficit that we talked about, a trillion  dollar deficits.  I know you're working on tax cuts 2.0 there in the House  Ways and Means Committee, what's your timeline there?  And do you worry  that paying for it is going to be a challenge? </p><p>NOEM:  You know, we're seeing growth in the economy which is exactly what  we knew we would see from tax reform.  That's why we're pursuing tax reform  2.0 to give permanence to individual rates, to continue to incentivized  families, to be successful into the future.  So we know what effects have  been already from the first step that we've taken to have 2.0 happen right  now will continue to grow this economy, give more people money in their  pockets, so they can be successful, and then help our treasury as well  continue to recovery by growth and businesses in revenues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much. </p><p>NOEM:  Thank you for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Kristi Noem joining us there.  Coming up, a blast  in Beijing.  The latest developments after a man detonates an explosive  device right outside of the U.S. Embassy.  The Jerry Jones standing up for  the national anthem.  The details as the Cowboys owner is bowing his team  will be required to stand during the anthem.  Back in the moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tech under pressure as Facebook is selling off 20 percent right  now.  McDonald's also reporting earnings this morning.  Cheryl Casone with  all the details there, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  How did breakfast do at  McDonald's, right, Maria?  Another stock to watch to your point.  They  reported better than expected results for their second quarter.  Same-store  sales in the U.S rising 2.6 percent global same-store sales climbing four  percent, all of that beating analyst forecasts thanks to the company's  popular value menu and, of course, breakfast.  Still having breakfast at  McDonald's. </p><p>Shares of McDonald's though, they are under precious at the premarket  slightly down about a quarter of a percent, so that's one name to watch  today.  We're also looking at Allergan set to open higher after results  beat the street.  The company announcing a new two billion dollar stock  buyback program.  The stock is trading higher ahead of the opening bell.   As you can see almost two percent.  American Airlines parent out with mixed  earnings. </p><p>Right now, earnings per share beat the street's estimate, but revenue fell  short of expectation.  That might be due to higher oil prices by the way.   American also cutting capacity guidance for the third and the fourth  quarters.  Capacity very important to airline analyst.  Shares of American  are lower in the premarket down about three-quarters of a percent.  Now,  the headline we're following this morning for you, a bomb exploding near  the U.S. Embassy in Beijing overnight. </p><p>Police there say the blast injured the 26-year-old man who was holding the  device.  It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is  from Mongolia.  His motive remains completely unclear.  The U.S. Embassy  was not damaged and thankfully, no one else was hurt.  Well, Nielsen CEO  Mitch Barns is retiring at the end of the year.  Barns became CEO of the  data analytics firm back in 2014.  Companies work plan to start a search  for a new CEO immediately.  Shares of Nielsen sharply lower actually in the  premarket right now on the news down 20 percent, so that's another stock to  watch today.  </p><p>Then finally, there is this.  Oh, boy.  You know those really popular  Valentine's Day candy hearts that we get.  Those.  Well, they could be in  jeopardy.  Necco that makes them has unexpectedly shut down operations at  its Massachusetts plant and they haven't even said if candy production is  going to continue at all. </p><p>Nearly 230 workers were shocked to hear the news.  They were told when to  pick up their final paycheck.  Necco was purchased by an investment company  for $17.3 million dollars at a bankruptcy auction in May and says it has  now sold the company to another buyer, so that buyer is watching.  Please  keep our candy hearts.  Necco knowingly a confectionary company is the  country's oldest continuously operating candy company, so some history  there as well, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Feel that sugar. </p><p>CASONE:  I love it.  Wow.  The video backup makes me smile. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) we think about the workers too.  We think about job  losses.  Wait.  That's not lost on us.  We came from hardworking stock of  small business owners, and so that's why when we talk about tariffs, I get  so passionate about it because I know that there are negative consequences  for some American workers and small business owners.  So, again, there's  balance.  That's what we aim for. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  When we come back, tracking a missing  college student's digital footprint, how Fitbit and Snapchat could help  with the search coming up.  Then, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowing his team  will stand for the national anthem.  Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star pitcher  Ross Stripling is here weighing in.  Plus, he's a stockbroker.  Back in a  minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From baseball to business, my next guest is an  all-star pitcher for the L.A. Dodgers who is also happens to be a licensed  stockbroker.  Joining us right now is Ross Stripling.  Ross, great to see  you.  Thanks for joining us. </p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, PITCHER, LOS ANGELES DODGERS:  Hey, guys.  Thanks for  having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we have a lot of questions for you from baseball to  business.  What -- first off, what made you decide to become a stockbroker? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Right.  You know, just took at an interest at a young age,  studied it in college, and when I got drafted, you get a sign bonus from  the Los Angeles Dodgers.  And remember asking my dad, I was like, you know,  I need to get in with your -- with your money guys.  I mean figure out  where to -- where to put this money and he was like, well, I don't know.   It's a good opportunity for you to learn how to do it yourself and ended up  investing my own signing bonus by myself and just kind of fell in love with  the market. </p><p>And as I was going up through the minor leagues, I had a Tommy John surgery  which forced me in this 14 months of my baseball career, and from there  just kind of didn't know if baseball is going to be my future, so I tried  to find something to fall back on and that's when I got in with B. Riley  who sponsored me to take my serious step and my 66, and became a licensed  stockbroker.  And that's, you know, how I kind of got here today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, good for you.  That's terrific.  We've got Jack Brewer on  the -- on the set today with us from the NFL.  And, you know, we've talked  about in the past how athletes make a lot of money and then they lose it  because they don't know how to apply it.  They don't know to save and grow  it, Jack. </p><p>JACK BREWER, FOUNDER, THE BREWER GROUP COMPANIES:  Yes.  Well, Ross set an  example, you know, Ross, I grew up in your neighboring Grapevine, Texas.  I  went to Grapevine High School.  I know you went to Southlake, so I had to  put that out there.  But as, you know, two Texas boys that -- it's a --  it's really good to see what you're doing.  You know, I had a similar story  man playing in the National Football League and I got hurt for the sixth  time. </p><p>Actually, sixth surgery and I went and got my broker's licensed, so I mean  I applaud you and your effort.  You're only 28 years old.  Tell me a little  bit.  How is it the response have been from your teammates?  Are you able  to take, you know, your example and really show other players that you  played with or other guys that may be in the league?  How have they  responded? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I think that's originally one of the main  reasons why I wanted to do it is, you know, like you said, around a lot of  guys that make a lot of money and they may not necessarily understand it.   It's a very complicated subject and, you know, there's a lot of moving  parts and then I wanted to be able to help in the locker room when guys had  questions about certain things where their money is, why it might be there  that, you know, maybe they're not comfortable asking their broker for  whatever reason or they just don't have time, and I'm much more convenient. </p><p>I'm right there.  And the response has been great.  Guys seems like I get a  question or two every day from different guys asking about just a wide  array of things from municipal bonds to the equities that they're in and  all sorts of stuff.  So that's the most -- one of the most fun things for  me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what would you do with Facebook this morning? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Man, yes.  That's going to be ugly opening, huh?  That's going  to be down like below 170, so I don't know.  I'm certainly going to be  watching it and I don't -- I haven't had a good chance to buy Facebook like  that in a while down to 170, so we'll see. </p><p>BELL:  Hey, Ross, it's Lindsey Bell.  I'm just wondering, you know, what  has been your best stock pick to date and what do you think about the  markets where we're out here, you know, we're kind of getting along into  the tooth in this bull market? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Right.  Well you know, the last time I did something like this,  I used an individual name and I got a bunch of trouble, so I'm going to --  I'm going to stay away from using an individual name.  But I'm extremely  bullish.  I'm always bullish.  It's just not in my nature to be bearish and  root for anything to go down unless they're playing football against my  aggies I guess.  But, you know, obviously, there's some good things going  on with the union, European Union right now, decrease in tariffs. </p><p>It looks like maybe getting rid of that trade war a little bit, so in the  short-term definitely some good things that Trump is doing in my opinion.   And but for me, I'm always bullish, always looking for stuff in the long  run, always looking for kind of some small and midcap disrupters in the  tech industry, or kind of what I'm looking for the most part, and just  things that I believe in, you know, moving forward in the long run that are  going to be around for a long time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So you like the stock market.  What about this  controversial national anthem protest story?  Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones  says that he's going to require his team to stand during the national  anthem.  This hasn't been an issue for the MLB we know.  But what do you  make of the environment right now? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I'm certainly glad that hasn't made its way to  the MLB like you said.  You know, that's obviously been a very  controversial thing and something that I'm glad that we haven't had to take  much part in.  But, you know, as a Cowboys fan, I respect Jerry Jones  taking the initiative and wanting guys to stand up for the anthem.   Obviously, I understand where guys are coming from when they protest and,  you know, like I said, glad that baseball is kind of been able to stay away  from it.   But, you know, look, look forward to seeing guys stand for the national  anthem, obviously, that might be continuing thing moving forward.  But we  'll see how it goes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Ross, good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much. </p><p>STRIPLING:  Cash. Thank you, guys.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us there.  Comuing up, Energy Secretary  Rick Perry will join me.  He'll weigh in on trade, tariffs, energy,  business with the E.U., and a lot more.  Plus, a new take on smart  clothing, how Tommy Hilfiger will reward customers for wearing its  merchandise, coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the east coast.  The Bears taking a  swipe at Facebook in the premarket this morning.  The social media giant  getting hammered, down 20 percent right now, after reporting disappointing  sales and revenue guidance, $150 billion in market value wiped out in the  extended hours last night after the company's conference call on earnings.</p><p>More technology stocks reporting today, Amazon and Intel, reporting this  afternoon, Amazon right after the closing bell.  That's going to be one to  watch today.  Down 1-1/3 percent going into those numbers.  We are an hour  away from the opening bell this morning, and Futures are indicating a mixed  start to trading.  We're just getting the durable goods number out.  The  durable goods report just hitting the wire coming in well below analysts'  expectations, durable goods up one percent last month, versus an estimate  of three percent, not a major reaction, though, from markets, NASDAQ still  down 50 points, that's largely on weakness in tech on the heels of  Facebook, Dow Industrials up 43 points.  Off of the highs but nonetheless  showing a gain on the Dow.</p><p>In Europe, this morning, we heard from the European Central Bank which left  interest rates unchanged.  The DAX Index in Germany up 1-1/3 percent, it's  been strong all morning on a -- on a deal with the E.U., and the U.S.  The  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent, the FT-100 in London  flat.  The Asian markets closed mostly in the red overnight with the  exception of Korea, that was up three-quarters of one percent.  </p><p>The end of tariffs troubles on the horizon, president trump detailing his  plan with the European Commission President after yesterday's meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  This is why we agreed today, first of all, to work together towards  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto  industrial goods.  We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade  and services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as  soybeans.  Soybeans is a big deal!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President calling it a big day for free and fair trade.   Meanwhile, Snapchat (INAUDIBLE) investigators are turning to Snapchat and  Fitbit to help in a search for a college student missing since July 18th.   Authorities are hoping the data can help them pinpoint her location.  Big  Tommy is watching you, apparently, Tommy Hilfiger, taking their rewards  program to the 21st century.  The company's new line features smart chip  technology in the clothes, gives you points every time you wear their  clothes, I guess they're tracking you as well.  </p><p>Poor Paul, House Speaker Paul Ryan taking a page from Jimmy Kimmel's book  reading some mean tweets about himself.  And they don't pull any punches.   We'll have that for you also, coming up.  Right now, though, America  charges forward with energy production.  The United States looks to secure  its place as the world's leading producer of oil and natural gas.  The  first natural gas liquification facility on the east coast is being  dedicated today.  It comes less than a day after the President strikes a  major energy deal with the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas, LNG,  from the United States, and they're going to be a very, very big buyer, so  they'll be able to diversify their energy supply which they want very much  to do, and we have plenty of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now, with an exclusive look at the new  facility is Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  You're welcome, Maria.   It's a beautiful place out here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are leading the dedication of this new plant today.   How important is the new plant to this trade deal and easing trade tensions  with the E.U.?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, obviously, this is one of a total of six.  We've got two that  are up and running right now, four that are in some part of being completed  and ready to be selling U.S. LNG across the world.  But this is a fabulous  opportunity to send a message.  I was in Belgium about two weeks ago  talking to my counterparts in the E.U., as I'd also talked to some folks  from other parts of the world as well.  But they know that we have this  extraordinary supply.  What's happened in the energy secretary is  phenomenal, from the standpoint of production or liquefied natural gas, and  it has multiple impacts, obviously, for national security in America.  </p><p>The idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply but  also to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for  the E.U. President yesterday, this isn't just about an economic thing for  the United States, it's about the supply and the security of our allies in  the European theater.  They don't have to sit there and be held hostage  with just one supply of gas.  The United States where there's going to be  going into Poland, where there's going to be coming in to the southern part  of the European Union.  They can rest assured that the United States is  going to be there, be a supplier with no strings attached of liquefied  natural gas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what kind of a deal are we talking about?  I mean, because  I know that the President pushed back at the NATO meeting just a couple  weeks ago, basically said look, we're protecting you from Russia and you're  buying your gas from Russia.  So, is this -- is he going to take some of  that market share?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, absolutely.  That's what we intend to do.  The Nord Stream II  and the Turkish Stream which coming in from the south.  Neither one of  those are commercially viable.  They're there so that Russia can be the  sole supplier of energy for the European Union.  The vast majority of the  E.U. understands that, and they're not for those two lines as well.   Germany is, I think Austria has a tendencies to be for it as well because  they've got a company that is going to help construct it, but the final  decision-making process, I think the Europeans recognize fully that the  United States is a supplier of LNG, that they want to have, and it does a  multitude of things, not only does it give them some security from a  national security standpoint, it also will have a massive positive impact  upon the environment.  </p><p>We've seen that right here in the United States with over the last decade,  14 percent decrease in our carbon emissions, and that's what the Europeans  are really focused on as well.  So, they can two things that are really  good for them, national security, and helping their environment, and the  United States and our LNG is going to be a major player with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about Dominion Energy Cove Point LNG.  This is the  second natural gas liquification facility to enter service and the first to  be built on the east coast.  Tell us the significance of it and what kind  of production you're expecting here?</p><p>PERRY:  Yes, in an international partnership, Japan and India are both our  partners in this plan, as you can see right over my shoulder, there's a  tanker that's waiting to be filled, and sent on its way.  When I was over  in India earlier in the year, we had a -- we had a load of gas coming in to  India for the first time, so these are amazing times, but the message is  clear.  The United States is blessed because of innovation, hydraulic  fracturing and our ability to directionally drill to have access to the  shale gas, an unconventional play.  It is putting America in a place that  we haven't been in 60 years, a net exporter of natural gas.  </p><p>So, geopolitically, you think about, Maria, five years ago, where we were  from the standpoint of being reliant upon some countries who didn't  necessarily have our best interests in mind to today being the largest oil  and gas producer in the world.  A stunning turnaround and anyone who would  argue that that's bad for the United States, and we're going to be able to  -- on the environmental side -- I think again, it can't be understated how  much of an impact it has to take those old inefficient plants off that are  running in China, in India, and in Germany, for that matter, replace it  with LNG, and I will suggest that for the Germans and for anyone else, the  best interest there is in American LNG not relying upon the Russians as  their sole source.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked a lot about the price of oil and about  manipulation going on in the market.  Do you see more production impacting  oil prices as well?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, here is the real issue from my perspective, the United States  can fill the pipelines around the world, as a matter of fact, we fill the  pipelines so much in United States that that's our limiting factor.  Going  out of the Permian Basin into the world market, it is restricted at this  particular point in time because we don't have the pipeline capacity.  So,  building those pipelines, getting the spigot open in a bigger way from my  perspective and I think from the President as well, is a clear message that  that's the way to help address the price of crude, let's get more in the  market, it's just a plain economic standpoint of supply and demand.  And  when there's a huge demand out there right now, lower restrictions in our  pipelines, but over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll be opening them up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on this, Russian hackers reportedly  infiltrated a network of electric utilities last year, it's according to  The Wall Street Journal, a Department of Homeland Security official said  that it could have led to blackouts or even worse, how serious is the risk  for hackers to be successful in the near future, Sir?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, it's obviously a real concern that we have, you know, five  years ago, this wasn't something we're particularly worried about, but over  -- I mean, literally millions of times a month, you will see companies that  are being hit, particularly these electrical control panels.  The sector- specific agency that has the responsibility for that is the Department of  Energy.  So, we're working on it, we stood up a new office called Caesar  with cybersecurity as being the real focus there.  Tuesday, I'm going to be  in New York City with the Secretary of Homeland Security and some other  folks who have cybersecurity in their portfolios as well to talk about the  United States and our focus upon cybersecurity in this country.  It is  real, but we've got some of the best in the world that are doing their due  diligence at our national labs to come up with the defensive and the  offensive ways to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Iran, America is pressuring its allies to stop  importing oil from Iran ahead of the reinstated sanctions next week.  Iran  is threatening unspecified countermeasures.  What might they be?  Your  reaction to Iran.</p><p>PERRY:  Maria, the President has been very straightforward, he's been very  blunt with the Iranians.  The destabilization of the Middle East and other  places around the world, he's just not going to put up with it.  And  whatever we need to do to send a message that Iran can be -- you know, they  can -- they can be participants in the world order, they can be  participants in that part of world and do it in a civil and a peaceful  thoughtful way.  If they don't, the President has been very clear, there  will be powerful sanctions, there will be strong pushback from United  States and our allies, sending the message -- this isn't about the Iranian  people, this is about the leadership in that country, the revolutionary  guard in particular, you know, act decent in the world you live in and you  can expect to do business with the United States.  If you don't, there will  be hell to pay. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, he has been very clear.  Secretary, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>PERRY:  Good.  Maria, so long.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Secretary Rick Perry joining us there.   Coming up, getting rewarded for wearing clothes, how Tommy Hilfiger is  giving customer prices for wearing its brand, coming up.  Then Paul Ryan  poking some fun at himself, the House Speaker's hilarious response to  reading mean tweets about himself, later this hour.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets cheering the thaw in trade tensions  between the U.S. and the European Union, following President Trump's  discussion with E.U. Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker.  We want to talk  more about that in a minute.  We're going to welcome Stuart Varney.  By the  way, yesterday, Stuart said all I want to see is Juncker and President  Trump walk out with smiles and be happy, and the markets are going to turn,  and that's exactly what happened.</p><p>BELL:  Sounds like is exactly what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at the big reaction at the -- after the close.</p><p>BELL:  There was.  I would have like to see --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, even before the close, sorry.</p><p>BELL:  -- more clarity on the auto tariffs, but you know, this is a great  step in the right direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, let's bring in Stuart Varney who called it,  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you called it.  This time  yesterday, you and I posed the question, what happens if we get some good  news on trade, does the market pop?  I said, yes.  I think you said, yes,  too, Maria.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But you -- but you had the idea, and that was a great  idea.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's true, that's exactly what the market wanted, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  And now, there may be a little bit of a follow  on today.  May I remind you that there's a delegation from Mexico in D.C.  right now, talking trade, they want to wrap up a trade deal, a bilateral  trade deal, you could possibly get some more smiling faces, not necessarily  the news conference, but some smiley faces when they walk out of the  meeting.  That could mean another small leg up for the overall market.   But, to me, the most important thing in that trade deal is that they, the  Europe (AUDIO GAP) take that China, and they're going to take a lot of our  energy, natural gas, take that Russia.  Seems to me that the Europeans  blinked and Trump won again.  That's the way it seems to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes.  We'll see.  I mean, they said that they're going to  work towards zero tariffs, but let's not forget the aluminum and steel  tariffs are still in place, and they said also, Dagen, that it's non-auto.   That's really what the sticking point was, the auto (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That rally was purely based on the fact that this is a de- escalation of tensions, it is a truce on additional tariffs, particularly  the threat of tariffs on the European automobile imports.  But, again,  we're still watching because these steel and aluminum tariffs -- what?</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, look, you're not going to have a tit-for-tat escalation with  Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, right.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's not going to happen, they agreed not to do that yesterday.   That was the heart of the good news.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But as one of our viewers just --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's when markets rallied -- yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As one of our viewers just tweeted, it's time for more go than  show.  It like let's actually get deals done and let's alleviate some of  the pain from the steel and aluminum tariffs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's doing it.  I mean, Stuart just said the Mexicans are  in the White House today and we keep hearing HHS secretary that we speak  with, Stuart, that they feel really good about a deal with Mexico over the  near-term, and they assume that Canada is going to get in line as well once  the Mexico deal is done.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, that's the way it looks.  The incoming -- the new President of  Mexico has -- his top trade advisor has publicly said, they want to wrap up  a deal, a bilateral deal with United States in a matter of months.  Now,  that's a big deal.  If that happens, well, the Canadians, they're going to  have to come on board somehow or other.  I think it's progress all around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wilbur Ross was on the show earlier, he said, look, Mexico is a  lot more complicated than Canada, and we know that, because Mexico, you  know, there are different deals in terms of workers, where car will  originate in terms of production.  So -- but he, too, was pretty optimistic  about a deal with Mexico.  Stuart, I know you're going to have a lot more  in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you got it.  Sure thing.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in just 10 minutes' time.  But first, there's  this, Paul Ryan goes from House Speaker to standup comedian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Paul Ryan  could be a live action Disney villain. #WidowsPeak\"  They used to call me  Eddie Munster so it's not too much of a stretch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of the tweets, coming up.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investigators are now focused on digital  information in the search for a missing college student in Iowa.  Cheryl  Casone with the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  Well, using search warrants, authorities are analyzing 20-year- old, Mollie Tibbett's digit info, that includes her Fitbit which she always  wore, her Instagram and her Snapchat data to track her whereabouts and at  least put a timeline together of her whereabouts the night that she  disappeared while out on a run.  She was last seen jogging in her hometown  of Brooklyn, Iowa about a week ago.  All the information is a key piece of  the investigation, it is not being made public, at this time, but they are  getting data off of her devices.</p><p>All right.  Well, check out this incredible video, dozens of people forming  a human chain to save swimmers from a riptide.  You can see them locking  arms up the coast of Emerald Isle, this is in North Carolina, by the way.   Emergency crews also got involved in some of these rescues.  Sadly, they  were unable to revive a 41-year-old man after they pulled him out of the  water.  The water looks, to me, it's terrifying.  Swimmers a lot of times  did not heed the beach safety warnings, so that's kind of what happened  there.</p><p>All right, Tommy Hilfiger is offering rewards to customers who wear its new  line of smart clothing that comes with a smart chip tracking how often  customers wear it.  So you earn points that can be used to buy concert  tickets or merchandise.  The brand hopes that interest in the new line is  going to create a microcommunity of brand ambassadors.  </p><p>And then, there is this, this is fun, House Speaker Paul Ryan posted a  video reading mean tweets about himself, taking inspiration from the  popular Jimmy Kimmel segment.  Watch!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RYAN:  Paul Ryan could be live action Disney villain.  #WidowsPeak.   Woodchucks eating Paul Ryan's car has given me hope for the future.  My car  dealer as well.  I want to high-five Paul Ryan's face with a shovel, just  hard enough to make him see birdies.  Take that smug look.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE:  There's the look.  With Ryan not seeking re-election in November,  maybe some of these critics are going to ease up on him.  At least he  proved he can take a serious joke or tell one, if you want to put it that  way, Maria.  It's really funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is very funny.  Maybe he's just taking it all in stride  now that he knows he's on his way out.</p><p>CASONE:  Why not?  Relax about it, all right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a break.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you much every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Smart, hard-working lady.  The best in the business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  Have a great day.  Go seize  that day.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day.  Yes, indeed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  Let's get right  at it.  This stuff is very important for everyone.  Facebook slowing down,  and that spells real trouble for the company and its investors.

It's time to turn  it over to Maria Bartiromo.  Good morning Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there ladies, good  morning to you.  Happy Thursday and good morning everybody, thanks for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top  stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook unfriended on Wall Street that's for sure, the stock is plunging  this morning on the edge of the plunge last night, disappointing sales and  revenue guidance.  Nearly $150 billion wiped from market value in the  afterhours trading session.  Incredible drop on Facebook, down seventeen  and a quarter percent right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the sector for sure, the big  names in technology this morning under pressure.  Take a look at Twitter  down three percent and Alphabet, parents of Google down and a third  percent.  Amazon will report its earnings after the close tonight.  Ahead  of that, the stock is down one and a three quarters percent.</p><p>Broader markets this morning look like this, in fact, it's a mixed story.   Dow Industrials are up 50 points but look at the NASDAQ where we've got so  many technology names there and that is down almost one percent, 60 points  lower on the NASDAQ this morning.</p><p>There's wild session on Wall Street yesterday, stock surge in the last 30  minutes of trading.  On news of a softening trade dispute between the U.S.  and the E.U.  President Trump talking about working toward zero tariffs.   Yesterday, the Dow Industrials up 172 points at the close with that huge  rally in the final 30 minutes.  The NASDAQ was up 91 points, better than  one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank in a sense of when rising interest rates might be on the  horizon.  What happens next with European stimulus.  The European markets  are fractionally better on the session with the CAC Quarante in Paris up  three quarters of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up one and a  third percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets mostly lower at the close, as you can see best  performer was Korea.  Kospi Index up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Easing trade tensions, President Trump and European Commission President  Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to negotiate a  trade deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Over the years the United  States has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars with the European  Union and we just want it to be a level playing field for our farmers, for  our manufacturers, for everybody.</p><p>And we also want a big beneficiary to be the European Union, so we think it  can be good for everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning we take a look at the key issues at stake coming  up right now.  Plus, an explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the  only person injured was the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We  have the very latest on this investigation coming up.</p><p>President Trump star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame destroyed.  Take a look,  the suspect using a pick axe and later charged with felony vandalism.  We  will tell you who is bailing him out of jail this morning, coming up.</p><p>Plus, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones standing firm in his support for the  national anthem, he says all players will be required to stand during the  national anthem.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Former NFL Star and  the Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer with us this morning.  Along with CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of news this morning.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  It's going to be a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.  Facebook obviously the story of the moment  Lindsey.  Is that going to be an overhang over the -- over the broader  markets in your view?</p><p>BELL:  You know what, I think it will be an overhang on the tech sector  today but hopefully Amazon can turn the ship around this evening when they  report results.</p><p>I think one thing to note about tech and the overall market in general is  going into the earning season.  I was really concerned about CAPEX  declining because it had been up on average 40 percent over the last three  quarters.</p><p>But you saw even though Facebook's numbers weren't great and the outlook  was poor, they increase CAPEX spending, so did Google.  They more -- they  like doubled it.  And then you're also seeing industrial companies  increased their CAPEX, so it's very good for future growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That conference call really sounded wild last night Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Again, there's an  incredible, what they call in journalism a tick tock in the Wall Street  Journal about that conference call.  How Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl  Sandberg come on the call and talk about how awesome business is and  Instagram is so amazing.</p><p>And then the chief financial officer comes on and drops one bomb after  another in terms of talking about the growth -- revenue growth rate isn't  just slowing in the second quarter but it's going to continue to do that in  the third and fourth quarter. </p><p>There was trouble because of the new European regulations.  Currency  headwinds, new privacy options for users, he -- that was part of the blame  but he said that new ad formats such as those within the Instagram stories  are not pulling the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and  Instagram feeds.  So there's a lot of bad news in there.  </p><p>Just putting exclamation point on it, we had Facebook at a new all-time  high yesterday.  In one day the stock is almost in bear market territory.   In one day it went from an all-time high to nearly a bear market which  would be a 20 percent drop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Seventy percent drop right now and I guess it became clear last  night that all those investment into security, into privacy as a result of  what's been going on with privacy is going to cut into growth.</p><p>Bottom line, Facebook is not going to be immune to this.  You mentioned  story segments section in Instagram, that's not going to bring the margins  that the rest of the company has been bringing, that's the bottom line.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  So they're going to have to figure out--again, because  the story is a memo--it's sort of an offshoot of Snapchat, they put those  in place to take on Snapchat because they're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where it goes away in 24 hours.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  They're -- but I -- following those stories and using  them, there are ways that they can better integrate the actual -- to  monetize those and then to place the ads in those stories.  So they're  asking for a long runway.  Well today, investors are not giving an answer  on them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  It says margins are getting cut going forward because of all this  and their investments especially in security.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, this is the group that has been the  leadership in terms of gains for the broader markets.  This is where the  money has been moving.  So there's probably expectations up here and the  realities over here.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And just real quick, because I'm not a phony, that was an  outstanding news coming out of the White House yesterday, that's exactly  what investors needed to hear in terms of cooling the tariff tensions, the  trade tensions and giving kind of some insights to the road ahead, a  renegotiating trade deals.  Maybe even with Europe which is a goal but then  NAFTA and then taking on China. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets obviously reacted to that immediately.  The president  comes out with Mr. Juncker and starts talking about working towards zero  tariffs which by the way was exactly what the president has been trying to  get for -- from a lot of these players.  </p><p>Yesterday we heard from a number of players that Mexico may be next.  We'll  see if they can do a deal with Mexico and then Canada follows along.  This  whole wild, you know, upset over the tariffs will go away.  So we'll see.   And then there's the NFL Jack Brewer, what do you think about Jerry Jones?</p><p>BREWER:  Ah, it's expected.  You know, Jerry has -- he stood strong, this  is not a change in his approach, in his tone in regards to this whole  situation.  You know, it's one thing to talk about kneeling with the goal  and to actually pass a policy then pull it back, go back and forth.</p><p>I'm interested in owner seat like Jerry Jones.  His fan base wants to see  his players stand for the national anthem, I understand that.  I know, I've  said this before, right, people, this is America, you can stand, you can  kneel, you can do what you want.  But if your boss tells you to stand, you  stand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you stand.  And that's what we are this morning.  A lot of  stories to cover.  </p><p>We want to kick it off right here with our trade ceasefire story, top of  news.  President Trump headed to Granite City, Illinois this morning where  he is set to tour a steel mill that is now boosting production following  the president's move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  earlier this year.  This visit coming a day after announcing a breakthrough  in trade talks with the European Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We agreed today first of all to work together towards zero tariffs,  zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,  thank you.</p><p>While we are working on this, we will not go against the spirit of this  agreement unless either party terminates the negotiation.  So we're  starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it's going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still, the tariffs on aluminum and steel are costing American  companies.  Both Coca Cola and General Motors now say they will have to  raise prices on their products in large part because of the president's  trade fights.</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in from Washington is Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Thank you for having me on Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this was a big deal yesterday with the president and Mr.  Juncker.  Can you go through what was -- what was agreed upon?</p><p>ROSS:  Surely.  The objectives of a new trade negotiation have been very  firmly set, zero -- we're going towards zero tariffs, zero nontariff trade  barriers, zero subsidies.</p><p>So that should really level the playing field and enable American companies  to be fully competitive and get the kind of market access that they need.   Meanwhile, the steel and aluminum tariffs stay in place, we will continue  pursuing our investigation of the Automotive 232 and hopefully these  negotiations will be completed fairly quickly so that we can get to the  stable situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is the plan to eventually do away with the aluminum and  steel tariffs or the auto tariffs?  I mean, even on light trucks the U.S.  charges, what, 255 percent, right?</p><p>ROSS:  Well you notice on light trucks, the -- there was an exception for  automotive products.  It's said we'd work toward zero tariffs on  nonautomotive industrial products.  And to steel and aluminum, there's no  attention to abandon those industries.</p><p>So the president is very happy with the progress they have made and opening  new facilities.  I'm joining them today as we go out to visit one that had  just recently been reopened.  He's not going to do anything to destroy  steel and aluminum from their new found substance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was there a timeline discussed Secretary in terms of when we  might see actual clarity on what the trade deal will look like between the  U.S. and the E.U.?</p><p>ROSS:  There's no precise time table set because that's not a meaningful  thing.  But the president made it very clear he is not going to sit around  for the normal two, three years to get a trade deal done.</p><p>Since we've got the broad principals agreed, it now should be more filling  in the blanks than starting from ground zero.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what do you think about these tariffs hitting Detroit?   General Motors, Ford, and FiatChrysler all yesterday lowered guidance.   Are you suggesting their full year outlook says they revealed lower than  expected second quarter earnings, all of which were impacted by the rising  cost of steel and aluminum.</p><p>So Mr. Secretary, will the president's negotiations with the E.U. reverse  what's going on with the automakers?  We are already seeing that they're  expecting this to impact their business.</p><p>ROSS:  Well, I have said before, the impact of steel and aluminum on the  auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about one percent on the  cost of the vehicle.  </p><p>So to the degree that that might be passed along, that's possible.  But the  offsetting thing is what you're seeing unemployment figures.  Record low  unemployment, more jobs available than there are people available to fill  them for the first time ever.</p><p>Record low unemployment for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for women,  for young people.  I mean, the economy is booming and that's what's really  important.  The other important thing though is the president has made  clear he's not going to abandon the industries that just has helped to  revitalized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And what's the next priority then Wilbur?  We've been  talking a lot about the potential for a deal with Mexico.  Is that the  priority now as you continue to work with the E.U.?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we're working on a lot of different fronts all at the same  time.  And that shows you the speed and the breath of the president's  sculpt of these trace issues.</p><p>We have to get them fixed in a fairly short period of time.  They've gone  on too long, unchecked by prior administrations.  As to Mexico, the new  president very quickly appointed the team that would do the trade  negotiations for him has made very clear he wants to get a deal done.</p><p>And he did all of this without even waiting for his inauguration.  He'll be  inaugurated on the first of December and it looks pretty clear that his  goal would be to try to get something resolved between the United States  and Mexico prior to even his inauguration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think you -- is it fair to say then the change in  leadership in Mexico also was very positive toward better relations with  the U.S.?</p><p>ROSS:  Well potentially so.  It certainly has made us all feel a lot better  than we did during some of the campaign rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think that Canada will be close behind once you do do a  deal -- a new NAFTA deal with Mexico?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we hope so but the immediate focus is much more on Mexico.  The  issues there are more complex and we think we can get very good progress  very quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  Let me move on to China Secretary, the president  there said this morning that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.  Your reaction to what's coming out of China?  </p><p>Do you feel that you've been able to move the needle yet in terms of their  theft of intellectual property and technology?</p><p>ROSS:  Well we haven't seen any formal steps to resolve those issues.  But  you see these repeated announcements coming out of China, things that  they're doing with the banking system bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.</p><p>Clearly, they're feeling a pressure from the tariffs that the president has  put on and equally clearly they're having some difficulty implementing  their retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you feel better now that there's this agreement in place  with the E.U. potentially teaming up with the E.U. against China to  pressure China to stop bad behavior?</p><p>ROSS:  Well as we know, the E.U. has suggested several times publicly that  they hope they could resolve things with us so that they could join with us  very aggressively in dealings with China.</p><p>We'll have to see what turns out from that but it certainly is a good step  regardless what happens with China to move toward a level playing field and  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barrier and zero subsidy environment with the  E.U.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  A lot of great information Secretary, good to see  you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ROSS:  Thanks Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us there.  Coming up, breaking  overnight, an explosion outside the U.S. Embassy in China.  We will have  the very latest on this Beijing blast.  </p><p>Then big oil, big profits.  Analysts predicting another huge earning  season, we're taking a closer look at big oil as they start reporting  today.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A bomb exploding near the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing overnight, Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines.   Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  We're trying to get more  details Maria but here's what we know so far, police say the blast injured  the 26-year-old man, he was holding the device.</p><p>It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is from  Mongolia.  The motive though, we don't know at this point.  The U.S.  Embassy was not damaged and thankfully no U.S. personnel or anyone in the  area were hurt by this blast.</p><p>Well, Qualcomm now planning to scrap its plan to buy NXP semiconductors  after the deadline passed at midnight without any word on Chinese  regulatory approval.  China was the last of nine markets, they needed to  approve the $44 billion deal.</p><p>This appears to be the latest victim of U.S.-China trade tensions.  Shares  of Qualcomm, well, they're saving some money I guess, think of it that way.   The stock is up a little more than five percent in the premarket right now.  </p><p>All right.  Some other companies we want to talk about, Royal Dutch Shell  reporting its second quarter earnings jumping about 30 percent.  Net income  rise in the $6.02 billion from $1.54 billion from a year earlier.  He oil  company is obviously benefiting from higher energy prices.  Shell now plans  to buy back about $25 billion of its stock over the next two years.  </p><p>They made that announcement.  Shares of Shell, lower in the premarket, down  almost two and a half percent.  The earnings missed analysts estimates but  sell over of a mix back for Shell.  A lot of more earnings coming up,  Amazon as well today Maria.  So a lot of big names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Amazon after the bell.  And Qualcomm also  this morning announcing it's going to be buying back $30 billion of stock.   Buybacks continuing as well.  Cheryl, Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, if you're suit up to play, stand for the national anthem.   That's the mandate from the owner of the Dallas Cowboys this morning.  It  is the latest twist in this controversy.  </p><p>Then this, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame is smashed to pieces  again, you won't believe who bailed this guy out of jail after he did that.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Standing for the national anthem, Jared Max now  with the latest on the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' new requirement.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  New and similar to what we've seen  Maria.  Jerry Jones hasn't really waffled in his public stance on the  importance of his players, the men he employs and pays handsomely to stand  for the national anthem.</p><p>While there is currently no active policy on the anthem as the NFL and  Players Association said last week in a joint statement, they are working  toward resolution privately.  Yesterday Jones spoke out publicly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JERRY JONES, OWNER, DALLAS COWBOY:  Obviously wouldn't dare speak for any  of the other owners much less in general about 31 other owners.  But as far  as the Dallas Cowboys are concerned, you know where I stand.</p><p>It's our position that we've always had a written policy in place.  Our  policy is that you stand at the anthem, tow on the line.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Tow on the line.  But what about actions speak louder than words?   Remember last season after President Trump had weighed in heavily on the  anthem, Jones joined his players and team staff at a momentary kneel before  they stood for the anthem.  Jerry Jones, where are you today on President  Trump?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  His interest in what we're doing is problematic from my chair and I  would say in general the owner's share.  It's unprecedented if you really  think about it.  Like the very game itself, that's the way it is and we'll  deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  And for now there are no new national anthem policies into the NFL,  the League and Players Association said last week it will be several weeks  before we have a policy in place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Your reaction Jack?</p><p>BREWER:  Well I got two things to say, you know, we talked about this for a  long time and I don't think it's going anywhere.  You know, the National  Football League is the largest wealth creator for young African-American  men in this country.</p><p>And I just hate to see anything being done that's going to take away from  that.  I don't want to piss off any fans, I don't want make anyone upset,  because I know that those revenues and those resources that are going into  communities of color because of these African-American men getting wealth,  I want to keep that going.</p><p>And so I'll say that first.  The second thing I'll say is there are so many  issues that are facing NFL players, we talked about this before Jared  particularly with concussions and you have all of the drug issues with  giving guys too many opioids and all of the crisis that are going on, let's  talk about that too Jared.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  And --</p><p>BREWER:  I mean --</p><p>MAX:  -- players, also the retired players --</p><p>BREWER:  Exactly.</p><p>MAX:  -- you know, we hear -- you know, we're waiting for a lot of money  from NFL settlements.  But, again, this anthem issue Maria is tremendous.   Jerry Jones, I think speaks the volumes when he says I like everybody would  like for this to go away because very much, you know, sports is always the  divider where we didn't get politics into sports, that's where we went to  get away --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MAX:  -- from that.  But here we have this intersection where it doesn't  necessarily work for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  I like what Jack said earlier, if your boss tells you to  stand you do it.  If my boss tells me to stand giving a presentation, I'm  going to do it, you know.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  I mean it's --</p><p>BREWER:  And with football, it's even deeper because we know, we do  everything uniform, right?  You have -- you wear the same socks, you go to  pull them up, you wear the same uniform.  You can't wear Adidas, you got to  wear Nike.</p><p>You know, there's rules.  So I'm a big believer in that.  You know, I  listen to my dad, I listen to my teacher, I listen to law enforcement.  I  think, you know, that is a reflection of the new society that we have.  You  know, we've got to start respecting authority again.  We got to start  listening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you say the NFL is this great wealth creator, that's  because of America.  </p><p>BREWER:  One hundred percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's more than just your boss tells you to stand up, it's  because you're honoring America and the flag.  </p><p>BREWER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But a lot -- but you'll agree with this and it comes down to the  issue of when you go to work, you have to abide by your employer's rules  and it's -- and it's different in NFL because there's a player's contract,  there's a union contract with the league.</p><p>But I can't say whatever I feel like quite frankly, certainly not even in  my private life.  Is Twitter my private account or is it part of an  extension of where I work?  I can't say or do whatever I want and not face  any consequences.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though we firmly believe in the first amendment, the right  to free speech and a free press.  It -- that is not an unbridled right in  this country.  And when you're in the workplace, you kind of have -- like  you said, there are rules in the NFL and there will be rules about what you  can say and do during the national anthem.</p><p>BREWER:  Right.</p><p>MAX:  And they're working it out.  Hopefully they're going to work it out.   Nobody has got here.  Roger Goodell isn't, President Trump isn't.  This is  -- this is working it out, you know, in a sense of just we're going to do  it for the first time, we don't have the answers, right?  We don't have the  answers.  The other leagues stand.  The other leagues stand.  So --</p><p>BREWER:  That's why (INAUDIBLE) they're not picking on the NFL.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>BREWER:  They're not doing anything than any other sports league. </p><p>MAX:  And two other football leagues coming.</p><p>BREWER:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's  sports report on FOX News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio on XM115.  </p><p>We'll take a break, we got a lot going on this morning.  Coming up,  removing Rod Rosenstein, a group of House Republicans have introduced  articles of impeachment against the Deputy Attorney General.  More on that  move and whether or not it will take him out.</p><p>Then Wal-Mart driving sales in a whole new way, a glimpse into the future  of shopping right here.  </p><p>Plus, the latest on Facebook, setting the tone for market this morning,  down 17 percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 26th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Investors disconnecting from Facebook, this morning, the stock is getting  hammered after the company reported disappointing sales and revenue  guidance, the company lost $150 billion in market value, yesterday alone.   The conference call created some confusion in terms of will the company  continue to be able to grow the way it has, 30 percent, looks like, not.</p><p>Futures this morning, indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages,  take a look, Dow Industrials up 24, but the NASDAQ, taking a hit hard, down  almost one percent, largely on weakness on technology on the heels of  Facebook.  </p><p>Stocks surged in last 30 minutes of trading, yesterday, on reports of a  softening trade dispute between the E.U. and the U.S.  They -- the two  leaders, yesterday, came out and said that they are working toward a zero  policy, zero tariffs, and zero subsidies between the two.</p><p>In Europe this morning, investors are waiting to hear from the European  Central Bank.  We will get a sense of when rising interest rates might be  on the horizon.  FT-100 is flat this morning, but the CAC Quarante is up a  third of a percent.  The DAX Index in Germany up better than one percent.  </p><p>Asian markets closed lower, mostly, overnight, with the exception of Korea.   Worst performer was China.  Shanghai composite down three quarters of one  percent.  </p><p>Easing the trade tip, President Trump coming away from his meeting with the  European Commission president, with a renewed sense of optimism after  making progress toward a deal.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a call for impeachment, Conservative lawmakers were taking the  first steps to try to impeach Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  We  are taking a look at whether this resolution has a path forward, straight  ahead.</p><p>President Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized,  again.  You won't believe who is helping the vandal get out of jail, this  morning.  And if you're shopping at Wal-Mart, your next ride could be a  self-driving car.  Details on the retailers partnership with Waymo, coming  up this hour.</p><p>All that coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour, House  Republicans versus the Justice Department, House Conservatives filing  articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>The move coming after months of back and forth over documents related to  the Hillary Clinton and Trump investigations.  Congressman Mark Meadows and  Jim Jordan who filed the articles of impeachment, spoke with Fox News'  Laura Engram, last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  Well, we get the documents or we  impeach him.  And the only thing that we have control over is the ability  to bring impeachment straight to the floor.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  When was the last time you ever saw the FBI  take a disproven document with no credibility, no validity, no  corroboration, take it to a secret court, not tell the court who paid for  it, not tell the court that the guy who had wrote it had been leaking  information to the press, and not just once, four stinking times, and the  last one, Rod Rosenstein signed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Christopher  Bedford, he's the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Caller.  Chris, good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you the think this has legs impeaching Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>BEDFORD:  More on the public relations front, it seems.  The Conservatives  have been frustrated for a number of weeks.  And this document, the  articles of impeachment, has been circulating leadership and the  Republicans have been trying to tamp down on it, and say, guys, hold on a  second.  </p><p>Department of Justice have been meeting with people, just last night,  meeting with congressman in the Hill to try and see if they could figure  out a way to avoid this.  But Meadows and Jordan are pushing on.  Now, what  they would need, they need to force votes.  They haven't done yet.  </p><p>Right now, they referred it to the judiciary committee.  They could do that  as early as today, and then it would take two days or maybe longer to force  a vote.  But they would need half of the U.S. Congress to impeach him, and  they would need two thirds of the U.S. Congress to actually remove him.   And since Republicans are so split on this, I don't see either of those  things happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, the documents that have been delayed, do you  think this maybe puts a fire under the DOJ to get those documents to the  congressional investigators?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's one of the arrows in the repertoire here.  It's difficult to  try and put a fire under the DOJ and then Jordan and Meadows have been  saying that they're having more trouble getting documents out of out of  this DOJ or as much as they had under Eric Holder's DOJ, the Obama  administration's DOJ.  They are redacting information that's embarrassing.  </p><p>They're not being forthcoming and what it seems to be the last draw for the  Conservatives, was Rosenstein signing off on the actual -- on the -- on the  FISA court that used the discredited dossier, that seems to have been the  last straw that pushed Conservatives over and said, you know what, we're  going to push this out now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meadows -- Chris, it's Dagen McDowell, Meadows, last night, on  Laura Ingraham show, kind of hinted that they could make this resolution  live today, that would force a vote in the House.  However, after -- I  think there's a vote this morning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  After that,  Congress is gone until September the Fourth, so --</p><p>BEDFORD:  It would take a while for them to be able to do that.  So they  move very quickly this morning and very few things move very quickly in  Congress.  They can potentially force a vote that would have to be made  within the next two days.  </p><p>But as you said with recess coming up, this seems like it's more trying to  draw attention to the battle the Conservatives are having with DOJ than  actually realistic effort to remove the attorney general -- deputy attorney  general.  </p><p>BREWER:  Chris, this is Jack Brewer, how much did the past Trump-Putin  summit hurt the rally of support around this latest effort?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I strongly suspect that that was the reason we didn't see this  last week because the Conservatives have been pushing to move this last  week, and then after Trump took so much -- President Trump took so much  criticism over how he appeared to handle the summit, they -- I think they  held it off over a week and seems like it was dead.  </p><p>We had reporters that were ready to break the news that was happening.  But  we assumed that it was dead, and heard that it was dead after that summit.   And then I think what really pushed it over again was signing the warrant  here on the evidence here for the FISA warrant.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we knew that he signed off on the FISA warrant for  the fourth time.  We've known that for some time.  National Security  Adviser, John Bolton, commented on a future Trump-Putin summit.  </p><p>He issued this statement saying this, the President believes that the next  bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia  witch-hunt is over, so we've agreed that it will be after the first of the  year.</p><p>This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified yesterday before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defending the administration's policies  on Russia.  I thought he did really well.  Check out this exchange he had  with the Democratic Senator that was Chris Murphy.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT:  How do I know the difference between a  presidential statement that is not a policy and a statement that is?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  Senator, here's what you  should look at, compare the following, Barack Obama speaking tough on  Russia and doing nothing.</p><p>MURPHY:  Those are true.</p><p>POMPEO:  It is true.</p><p>MURPHY:  I understand you want to rewrite the Obama policy on Russia.  But  that's simply --</p><p>POMPEO:  OK.  </p><p>MURPHY:  He organized all of Europe and all over the world.  </p><p>POMPEO:  Let's go.  Let's go, Senator.  Let's go.  Let's go task to task.</p><p>MURPHY:  To put a comprehensive on president instead of sanctions on  Russia.</p><p>POMPEO:  The man said he would have more flexibility after --</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm not listening --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on what took place yesterday, and what do  you think the Russia policy is going forward?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It was a pretty fiery exchange, the Secretary came absolutely  ready to do battle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I really enjoyed some of the back and forth, that was -- it was  good television.  But I'm not sure how much further we got toward  understanding much.  I think he made a forceful defense of the  administration here, when he pointed out to the senators who were doubtful.  </p><p>That President Trump and his administration are not -- or inseparable, if  the administration doubles down on sanctions, removes more spies, shuts  down more compounds, deregulates energy, sends natural gas to Europe,  pushes for a stronger NATO, lethal aid to Ukraine, missiles back to Poland,  those aren't actions that take place without the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  His signatures on every one of those.  And the Senate didn't seem  to want to believe that and they were really seemingly trying to push a  narrative that was different.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he said a couple of times.  This is President Trump's  state department.  So, President Trump, at the end of the day, is in charge  of this decision-making.  But I thought it was really interesting the way  he defended the private meeting, the one-on-one with Putin.  He did a very  good job on that, Dagen, what did you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Incredibly measured.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And any of us watching the Secretary of State, had to sit there,  and listen to the garbage that was pouring out of the mouths of the  Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We tip our hats --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They put on a show.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, in terms of the level of insanity among  Democrats about Russia, Chuck Schumer, yesterday, was talking about the aid  to farmers because of the tariff fight that we've got into, as something  from the Soviet Union.</p><p>Number one, when did a Democrat hate a handout?  And number two, they have  to somehow link that whether you like it or not, to Russia and Putin and  the USSR, Chris, that -- again, that is something that does not resonate  with most Americans.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The USSR comparisons I saw yesterday were absolutely shameful.   Comparing President Trump's economic policy to the five-year plan, last  time I heard President Trump wasn't rounding up millions of Americans and  putting them in industrial labor camps at North Dakota and executing them  in mass.  </p><p>There was absolutely no comparison between aiding farmers during a trade  war that the administration is intending to win.  It doesn't want to leave  casualties in the battlefield.  And then Stalin asked economic planning  which murdered millions of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was pathetic, it was shameful, but it was more of the same,  right?  So, you know, with the immigration story, the next thing is abolish  ICE.  You know, I mean, they just go way too far with the analysis here.  </p><p>The Russia-Putin strategy, though, do you think it has been tougher than  the Obama administration?  I mean, that's a fair statement that regardless  of what happened in Helsinki at that press conference, the actual policies  have been tough on Russia?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Demonstrably tougher.  Every single difficult or tough step that  the Obama administration took, President Trump's administration has  maintained and then doubled down on most of those being economic and people  being deported or expelled from the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  In addition to that, the lethal aid and the energy aid to Europe  have been absolutely crucial.  The Russia gets its courage from energy  prices, deregulating the U.S. energy industry and sending natural gas to  Europe, that hurts Russia directly in its pocketbook.  </p><p>And being willing to about -- talk to Russia or as Secretary Pompeo said  (INAUDIBLE) remote chances are that we could come to an understanding with  Russia is something that should be pursued by any administration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  in the meantime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was a topic that was discussed yesterday with Mr.  Juncker, as well.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, it was.  I just -- Chris, I just wonder, there wasn't a lot of  information that came out of this and maybe that is to the secretaries --  you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By design?</p><p>BELL:  Yes, by design.  But the question is, though, does this lead to a  request for the translator to come in or for the Senate to see their notes?</p><p>BEDFORD:  The level of partisanship that we've seen that's absolutely  possible, we have seen the translators, the gentleman who translated for  President Bush, President Barack Obama, President Clinton, saying that this  President would be obscene.  </p><p>The ability for a leader to be able to have a private discussion with a  member of a cabinet or another foreign leader is critical.  I think it  would be a bad step.  </p><p>And if Republicans would very likely try as best they could to hold the  line, although people like Senator John McCain, have shown that they're  really disappointed in President Trump's interactions with Putin.  And they  may switch, also Senator Bob Corker who is one of the leaders yesterday in  grilling the Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the Secretary kept saying things like, well, look,  you do a private meeting and you keep it private because you're hoping to  have a second private meeting, and to actually make progress, and he kept  saying it back to them.  I'm sure you've had one-on-one meetings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was a gift, though, to delay the second meeting with Putin,  to delay it after the midterm elections, that's just a gift to anybody  running -- any Republican running for re-election because they can focus on  the issues and the things that truly matter to the American people, like  this booming economy, and not the tete-a-tete with Putin and Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great point.  Chris, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, Christopher Bedford, Daily Caller, there.   Coming up, days after a fatal shooting rampage in Toronto, officials there  want to ban handgun sales, more on that plan, coming up.  </p><p>Then, President Trump's star on the Walk of Fame, smashed to pieces, once  again.  And you won't believe who reportedly wants to pay the guy's bail to  get him out of jail after doing that, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Toronto seeking a ban of handguns sales in the  city, following a deadly shooting.  Cheryl Casone on details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, reaction is pretty swift there in Toronto.  The City  Council voting 41 to four to ban handgun sales along with sales of  ammunition for handguns, after two people died in shooting rampage last  Sunday.  13 others were hurt when the gunman opened fire in Toronto's great  town neighborhood.  Now, the suspect, 29-year-old, Faisal Hussein,  reportedly died after shooting himself.  Police are still looking into a  motive for that deadly attack.  </p><p>Well, back here at home, President Trump's star in the Hollywood walk of  fame has been vandalized again.  The 24-year-old vandal turned himself in  the police -- turned himself in -- after he destroyed it early Wednesday  morning.  Now, he's been held on $20,000 bail.  Here's what's interesting,  you may remember this guy, take a look at this guy who took a sledgehammer  and axe to President Trump's star just before the election in 2016.  Well,  reportedly, he wants to bail out the newest perpetrator.  Crews have  already started working to repair that damaged star.  </p><p>OK.  Waymo teaming up with Wal-Mart.  The company going to give shoppers a  lift to Wal-Mart in its self-driving cars under a pilot program.  Right  now, up to 400 people in Phoenix, Arizona -- known as early riders -- can  order their food on Wal-Mart.com, pick it up at a Waymo vehicle, and they  get dropped off back at home.  Shares of Wal-Mart are down about 10 percent  this year.  Shares of Alphabet, which is of course the parent of Waymo, up  about 20 percent, Maria.  So, you know, if you're going to pick up and take  me there and bring me, yes, I'm OK with that -- as long as it's free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The elderly still, you know, who still want to shop for  themselves and have trouble getting into the store, how about people who  just need a helping hand?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, very important.  Yes.  Coming up, Kalahari Resorts, the  sport and entertainment leader about to team up with a fall tradition for  one of a kind partnership -- details on that high-flying deal next.  And  we're following Facebook this morning, down 17 percent; setting the tone  for markets after growth is being questioned that the company, after its  latest second quarter earnings.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, how cool is that?  That storm chaser an interactive  waterslide in videogame at Kalahari Resorts in Sandusky, Ohio.  Kalahari is  valued at a billion-dollar and just announced a new float in this year's  Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.  Joining us right is Kalahari Resorts and  Conventions Owner, Todd Nelson.  Todd, great to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>TODD NELSON, OWNER, KALAHARI RESORTS AND CONVENTIONS:  Well, great to be  back again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll get to that Macy's partnership in a second, but how's  business going, characterize the environment that you're seeing right now.  </p><p>NELSON:  Business is really solid.  The economy is great.  People are  traveling and so we were just knocking on wood every day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to raise prices?  </p><p>NELSON:  No.  No, we would never do that, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Never.  Never is a long time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How sensitive are your customers to rising gas prices?  Though,  they're not -- they're up from a year ago but -- that has eased back a  little bit.  And I just wonder because you did so well during the great  recession of 2008, part of that, you know, oil and gas prices collapsed,  but how sensitive are the customers to gas?  </p><p>NELSON:  I don't think gas prices has a huge effect on us.  We drive  through destinations in all of our resorts and that's why we did so well  during the recession.  You know, we're typically a tank-full a gas away  from our four-hour driving switches our markets.  </p><p>BELL:  So, you're opening a new location in Round Rock, Texas; how do you  pick the locations for these parks?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, that one was really interesting.  We looked at Dallas and we  looked all over the state, and then 40 to 50 percent of our business comes  through our convention center.  So, Round Rock is just centrally located  right in the middle of the state -- 20 miles our of Austin.  Fantastic.   They really get business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, then, it's relying somewhat on the business community and  doing conventions?  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh, yes, 40 to 50 percent of our occupied rooms are.  But we're  very much into association business and in different types and even during  the recession, it really did not affect.  </p><p>BREWER:  Do you have a membership club or do you have any type of -- kind  of elite membership opportunities that you offer?  </p><p>NELSON:  No, we don't, but we are open to the community.  You don't have to  stay there to come in and enjoy our restaurants, shopping, and spa.  You  can even buy daily passes to come into the waterpark for a sustain.  So,  it's really resort-center build for everybody and every age.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important to get the balloon in the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day parade for you, tell us about that partnership?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, it's actually a float.  And it's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's water involved?</p><p>NELSON:  Yes, animatronics is involved, and it is going to be spectacular.   It's goings to be one of the Macy's -- it's just really cool.  54 million  people watch the parade.  They air it twice and in our market area, it's a  perfect partnership.  They're wonder people.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will there be people in bathing suits on this float in the water  because it's cold here in November?  </p><p>NELSON:  Yes, I don't think there'll be anybody swimming on our float.   There is going to be a, I think, a dozen people on the float, but it's  really going to be a cool float.  We visited the studio yesterday, it's  about half finished and it's gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm actually serious, I love a good water park, so anything  that screams -- that screams water slide is awesome.  How are you  innovating in terms of the rides and the attractions in the park?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, the first ride you saw, that's a virtual reality riding --  you actually play a game as you're going down it.  What we're trying to do  is we hit all age groups.  So, if you fear -- if you want to go to swim-up  in (INAUDIBLE), that's great for our older ones.  We have 12 grandchildren  now, so we've gotten really good at the five and under.  So, every age  bracket, there's something to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute this strength in the economy in the  backdrop in your business?  </p><p>NELSON:  I think there's consumer confidence right now.  I think people are  pretty -- into the economy and they said we do well in good economies and  bad economies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did the tax plan have an impact on your business?  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The tax cut plan?</p><p>NELSON:  Yes, I think it had a real nice effect on the business.  It put  more money on people's pockets, you know.  And people have to feel good  about spending their money.  </p><p>BELL:  What about National Waterpark Day?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it's Saturday.  </p><p>NELSON:  It's Saturday July 28th.  We actually founded National Waterpark  Day.  It is a holiday -- it's a national holiday now, and it was quite an  interesting process, and so we're going to turn that into a big deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Well, cheers to you and congrats, Todd.  Thanks very  much for telling us about it.  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, thank you very much, great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Todd Nelson, Kalahari Resorts.  Still ahead,  no more free lunch at Facebook.

Welcome back.  Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday.  It is Thursday, July 26th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Facebook unfriended on Wall Street this morning.  The stock is plunging on  disappointing sales and revenue guidance, nearly $150 billion of market  value wiped out in the after hours trading session.  The stock right now  down about 19 percent right now.</p><p>Facebook setting the tone for the rest of the tech sector.  The biggest  names in technology under pressure this morning.  Amazon is going to be the  one to watch today.  It reports after the close.  Going into the numbers,  the stock is down one and three-quarters percent.  Check out Twitter down  3.5 percent, Snap down 4 percent.</p><p>Broader markets meanwhile look like this.  Dow Industrials are fine, up 30  points.  But the Nasdaq taking a hit on the weakness in tech.  Nasdaq down  64 points right now, almost 1 percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a  percent.</p><p>It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday particularly in the final  hour of trading.  Stocks surging in just the last 30 minutes of trading on  reports of a softening trade dispute between the U.S. and the E.U.   President Trump explained why it's important to get a trade deal in place.   Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States and the  European Union together count for more than 830 million citizens and more  than 50 percent of the global GDP.  In other words, together we're more  than 50 percent of trade.  If we team up, we can make our planet a better,  more secure and more prosperous place.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Global markets this morning reacting.  We've got the CAC 40 in  Paris up a third of a percent.  The DAX index in Germany up better than 1  percent.  The FT 100 in London up just a fraction.</p><p>In Europe investors are waiting to hear from the European Central Bank.  We  will hear from the ECB and get a sense of when interest rates will be on  the rise coming up.  And we will bring that to you as soon as it hits the  tape.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly lower with the exception of  Korea.  That was up three-quarters of a percent.  </p><p>And then this -- censoring conservative ideas; a startling new report says  Twitter is shadow banning top Republican officials.  It's not happening to  Democrats.  The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>Bitcoin making a comeback -- the cryptocurrency surging above $8,000 for  the first time in months -- a closer look at the crypto craze this morning.</p><p>And there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, San Francisco is  trying to take away the free food at technology companies' cafeterias.   We'll tell you why.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Former NFL star and the  Brewer Group CEO Jack Brewer with us this morning; and CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.  </p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Yes.  Great to be here. BARTIROMO:  And the big story is Facebook this morning is down now 19  percent, Lindsey -- because people are now questioning about this 30  percent growth number that we've been seeing for so long at Facebook.   Looks like that's in the rear view mirror at this point.  </p><p>BELL:  But even declining by high single digits sequentially quarter over  quarter, which is the guidance that management provided, you're still  getting 20 percent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- top line growth.  Where else are you going to get that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  But you have to wonder if the stock where it's  trading at is equal to that kind of growth versus what else we were seeing  at Facebook.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I'll point to the Instagram  stories issue, because it was in the Instagram stories -- they're not  pulling in the same amount of money as ads shown in Facebook and in the  Instagram feeds.  </p><p>And this is particularly troubling because as of next year Facebook had  been predicting that the stories would have more essentially traffic than  the original photo feeds on Instagram.  So again, that's where they were  placing their bets.  Now they have to figure out a better way to monetize  these Facebook stories.</p><p>And they have been gaining traction.  A lot of people use those rather than  just kind of posting the run-of-the-mill photos and videos to their  Instagram feeds.  They're using those ones that disappear in 24 hours.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think Jack was posting a story earlier this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you posting?</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  I post the story -- I always post stories.  But they're  going to have to evolve that business model on the ad side when you talk  about stories.  I think at the end of the day you'll see over the next  maybe six to 12 months they're going to start using their influencers a  little bit more.  I think you'll see more partnerships with influencers  because those are the ones that are really driving the traffic.</p><p>Even -- look at YouTube now.  I mean if you go on YouTube now, a lot of  those ads and those pieces they're putting out, YouTube is actually  assisting the companies in producing those ads.</p><p>And so these social media companies are going to have to get more hands-on  with the way that they're putting the stories out, with the way that  they're actually generating the content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the news on Facebook is offsetting other positive news in  terms of trade.  Markets rallied on the results of a meeting yesterday with  the European Commission's Mr. Juncker and President Trump.</p><p>Joining us right now on the telephone is LJH Investment Advisers managing  director Larry Haverty.  Larry -- thanks very much for calling in this  morning.  Your reaction to Facebook?</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISERS:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry -- unfortunately, you're going in and out.  We're not  hearing you well.  Obviously, you're on a cell phone.  We would love to get  your insights on this.</p><p>But of course, $150 billion in lost market value in the after hours trading  session is what people are reacting to today.  Was it an overreaction in  your view?  </p><p>BELL:  No, I mean I think this has been a high flier.  It was up 25 percent  going into this press (ph).  There were high expectations.  And you know,  we got lucky in the first quarter.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not -- you didn't see it in the  numbers.  Now you're seeing it in the numbers.  There are repercussions for  this type of activity.  And there's -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially as they invest more in privacy tools.  That's going  to cost money.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's maybe short-term loss for a long-term gain.  These are  problems that have to get fixed if Facebook wants to retain this giant user  base that it has and continue to grow and monetize.  The people are using  say WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>But to shine a spotlight on what the stock is doing, shares hit an all-time  high yesterday -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and so in less than 24 hours essentially, it's gone into bear  market territory with almost down 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Left it all out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is so astonishing to see that.  And it is -- it's a lesson  to people when you invest in a company, a stock that has a really high  valuation on it, you better be in for the long haul.  You could lose -- if  you're going to sell today you could lose 28 percent of whatever you put in  yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"Journal\" story was great, going through the tick tock of  the conference call and sort of what, you know, Sheryl Sandberg said versus  Mark Zuckerberg versus the CFO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg saying Instagram has been this amazing success and  highlighting.  And then Sheryl Sandberg comes on and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- everything.  Yes, \"The Lego Movie\", \"everything is awesome\".   And then the CFO comes on.  Leave it to the money guy to be fair  (INAUDIBLE) and go, well, I've got a couple of bombs I'm about to drop on  you,\" 20 minutes into this conference call. .  It's not funny.  It's not  funny.</p><p>But there were a lot of problem areas that the finance chief highlighted.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that certainly is setting the tone for technology this  morning.  Facebook right now down 20 percent.</p><p>And then there's this, Trump talking tariffs.  President Trump off to  Illinois this morning to talk workforce development and tour a steel  factory that's reopened as a result of his tariff regulations.</p><p>Just in the last hour I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who  touted the President's tough stance on steel and aluminum tariffs.  Here's  what he told me this morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  So steel and aluminum, there's no  intention to abandon those industries.  So the President is very happy with  the progress they have made in opening new facilities.   I'm joining him  today as we go out to visit one that had just recently been reopened.  He's  not going to do anything to destroy steel and aluminum from their new-found  substance.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet, it's a double edged sword.  Both Coca-Cola and General  Motors will be raising prices they say on their iconic products in large  part because of the fallout over tariffs.</p><p>Joining me right now is Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz.  He is former deputy  secretary of Defense, former ambassador to Indonesia and former assistant  secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.  Ambassador -- good  to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be here -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Secretary Ross' notion that the steel and  aluminum tariffs are remaining intact.  The markets rallied hugely last  night on this idea that the E.U. and the U.S. are going to work toward no  tariffs but we know that the aluminum and steel tariffs are still in place.  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  And I think they're hurting some of our best friends including  Japan pretty badly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your thoughts on this strategy that the President has.  You  know, he comes into this saying ok, we lost $151 billion with the E.U.  We  lost you know, $500 billion with China.  We want a more level playing  field.</p><p>And do you think this is all a negotiation, that at the end of the day  maybe the U.S. comes out in a better place as it seems like the markets are  viewing this?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly hope so because there's no question, we need  a more level playing field.  But we could end up with a very, very rocky  one instead if this escalates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the President and the European Commission president Mr.  Juncker yesterday came out very positive and discussed that they are going  to have a breakthrough in trade talks to avoid a transatlantic trade war.   The two leaders agreeing to hold off on further tariffs signaling a pause  in the President's auto tariff threat.  Ambassador -- could zero tariffs  with Europe become a reality in your view?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It will certainly surprise me if it happens but it would be a  good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is your take in terms of what's happening in terms of a  cease fire when it comes to China?  President Xi issuing a stark threat to  President Trump claiming that there would be no winner in a global trade  war.</p><p>Your reaction to President Xi's comments?  What does yesterday's deal  between the U.S. and Europe mean for China?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  I think it puts more pressure on China.  And the issue with  China is not so much about the tariffs although they're relevant.  But the  real issue with China is the way it's been stealing intellectual property  here, not only by forcing companies to reveal what they have but also by  cyber methods, breaking into corporate secrets.  I think it's a very, very  dangerous trend that they've been on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  And I think it's good to be opposing them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're glad in terms of the pushback from America to China  in terms of the consistent theft of intellectual property?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  If it doesn't get out of control -- but my sense is from Xi's  comments is he's much more worried about where it could go than we are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Ambassador, let me move on to the President's bilateral meeting with  Vladimir Putin.  National security adviser John Bolton citing special  counsel Robert Mueller's investigation for a delay issuing this statement.   \"The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President  Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over.  So we've  agreed that it will be after the first of the year.\"</p><p>How do you expect the U.S. policy toward Russia moving forward and any  thoughts on the President's foreign policy decisions?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You know, one of the ironies here is that Putin has obviously  succeeded in sowing enormous dissension in the United States over our own  political process which is one of his goals.  But he's actually ended up  with a Russia policy that is probably much tougher than he might have had  otherwise and may even get tougher still.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that -- then, I guess that's a positive in your  view?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Positive that the meeting's postponed?  Absolutely.  But what I  would like to see more talk about is measures like this Magnitsky Act that  put pressure on Russian plutocrats to make it much more difficult for them  to hide their money here and to launder it.</p><p>And the British (INAUDIBLE) something called the unexplained wealth orders  which are now putting a lot of pressure on probably Russians, but maybe  other people as well, who are buying expensive property in London through  offshore shell companies to hide it.  That's a real threat to Putin and his  clique.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  That's why he's apparently going after Bill  Browder, who of course, it was Bill Browder's lawyer Mr. Magnitsky who was  killed in jail and he was able to get the Magnitsky Act.</p><p>Let me ask you about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday testifying in  front of the Senate foreign relations committee facing a barrage of  questions aimed at U.S. policy on Russia and on North Korea.  Pompeo vowed  that the U.S. will not relax sanctions towards Russia but said that we  cannot make progress with Moscow unless we're open to discussions.  Listen  to this clip from yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  President Trump believes the two  great nuclear powers should not have a contentious relationship.  This is  not just in our interest but in the interest of the whole world.</p><p>He strongly believes that now is the time for direct communication in our  relationship in order to make clear to President Putin that there is the  possibility, however remote it might be, to reverse the negative course of  our relationship.  Otherwise, the administration will continue imposing  tough actions against Russia in response to its malign activities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ambassador, it looked like Mr. Pompeo did well yesterday.   Anything strike you from that testimony?  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, I certainly agree with that second part of keeping up the  pressure.</p><p>I mean it's worth noting, Maria, that when President Reagan was negotiating  with the old Soviet Union, he didn't let up the pressure on Poland which  was one of their weak spots.  And even more impressively when he was  working closely with General Secretary Gorbachev to get an arms control  agreement that was very important to everybody he made that famous  statement about \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"  So he kept the  pressure up in Berlin.</p><p>I think the only way you get anywhere with people like Putin is by having  pressure on them.  If you just try to do it by being nice it never works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Ambassador -- it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, bitcoin is bouncing back.  The  cryptocurrency jumping above $8,000 for the first time in two months.   What's behind the recent gains -- coming up.</p><p>Then Twitter's shadow ban -- why some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fallout, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news -- two police officers killed in the line of duty.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWOR CORRESPONDENT:  We're getting some new  details, Maria, on this breaking news.  This happened in Milwaukee.  A 17- year police veteran was shot and killed by a suspect who was wanted on gun  and drug violations.  They do have that suspect in custody now.  A  procession of officers escorted the fallen officer's body to the medical  examiner's office.  Look at these incredible pictures.</p><p>This is the second death of a Milwaukee police officer just this summer.   What a show of support.</p><p>Meanwhile in Arizona, one officer was shot and killed and the other was  injured.  This happened last night there.  The officers responding to a  call about a man driving erratically on the roads.</p><p>Well, New York is keeping its promise to 9/11 victims' families 17 years  later.  Through improved DNA testing the medical examiner's office has  identified the 1,642nd victim of that terror attack.</p><p>Scott Michael Johnson was 26 years old.  He was working for the investment  banking firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.  He was on the 89th floor of the  South Tower.  The bone belonging to Johnson had been tested dozens of times  throughout the years but recent improvements allowed examiners to gain  enough DNA evidence to make that match.  Johnson -- the first victim to be  identified since august of last year.</p><p>Well, Mattel is cutting costs and they're cutting jobs.  The company  slashing 2,200 jobs as they continue to struggle with falling sales after  reporting weak and unexpected quarterly results.  Mattel, which is of  course, well-known for making Barbie and Hot Wheels, also hurt by the  closing of Toys R Us which happened recently this year.  Shares of Mattel,  Maria, are trading lower in the premarket -- ok, a lot lower, down by 11  percent.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big move there, cutting 2,200 jobs and the stock takes a hit.</p><p>CASONE:  Which is -- usually it's the opposite we see.  That's not good for  that company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, bitcoin bouncing back this morning, the cryptocurrency jumping  above 8,000 for the first time in two months.  What's behind that big gain,  coming up. </p><p>Then, no such thing as a free lunch, right.  Why San Francisco is now  looking to ban free cafeterias at technology companies -- one of the best  perks there is.</p><p>Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Bitcoin optimism is back.  The cryptocurrency reaching over $8,000 a token  for the first time since May.  Ripple chief market strategist Cory Johnson  joins us now to talk more about that.  Cory -- it's great to see you.  </p><p>CORY JOHNSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RIPPLE:  Good to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What do you make of this  recent move higher on bitcoin?  And tell us how you see the overall market?   Because you're really much more bullish on XRP as opposed to bitcoin.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  Well, I think -- I think for us, you know, Ripple has based  some of our software solutions on XRP because we think it's a better  technology.  We look at XRP as sort of block chain 2.0.</p><p>The bitcoin is a fascinating idea but it's really sort of breaking down in  terms of its ability to use it, closing transaction is really slow.  We're  looking at a business problem.  And the business problem is moving money  across borders.</p><p>It is crazy that today I can send a text message to a friend in Rome with  emojis and a gif of falling down and clever stuff and I can send an Excel  spreadsheet by e-mail to South Africa in 3 seconds.  But if I want to move  money from New York to Mexico City it takes five days and costs over 500  basis points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's crazy in this era of technology.  So Ripple has created a  bunch of software products to really accelerate that process, to move money  in less than a minute and for, you know, just basis points.  But using XRP  as a basis technology for some of the software solutions we can move it so  much cheaper and so much more efficiently using XRP.  We think that XRP  will have great value over time.  </p><p>BELL:  What about consumers?  Mastercard just applied for a patent to be  able to use cryptocurrencies on credit cards.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  Is that the future of currencies?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I mean we are 100 percent focused on business.  I mean I think  that there will be lots of better ways for money to move but again, when  you talk about moving money, bitcoin's slow.  Ether is slow.  XRP moves  really, really fast just because of the way the technology is a little bit  different.</p><p>I don't want to give you the technological details but fundamentally money  should move as fast as ideas move as fast as data moves.  And right now it  doesn't.  And it's really expensive.</p><p>The place that money hurts -- that slow-moving money hurts people is moving  money across borders.  If you are working and your family is in another  country, if you're on vacation in another country, if you're a business and  you want to buy products in another country to sell it where you are, it  takes so long to move money and costs so much money.</p><p>Imagine if your business is selling (ph) with 500 basis points -- the World  Bank says it's a 532-basis point cost to move money across borders for  anyone.  That's a horrible drag on business.  We're trying to fix that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the regulatory hurdles and head winds country by  country in terms of are they rising because again, we talk about no borders  in terms of virtual currencies but there are borders and regulators love to  make sure that even in the digital world that those borders exist.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Look, one person's regulation is another person's protection.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I believe it's really important for investors to be protected.   We've seen what happens when there aren't investor protections.  We've seen  investors lose so much money.  And we've seen it in the world of crypto.   We've seen some real bad actors involved.</p><p>So we're thrilled that regulators are getting involved.  It's really  interesting.  It's not what I expected when I joined this company say six  months ago and we're very much engaged in conversations with regulators.</p><p>But I'll say that a lot of other countries are moving faster than the U.S.  to try to provide really clear lanes of where business can act, what's  right and what's wrong.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like China.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, China's a really peculiar case.  Most of the bitcoin  mining, most of the ether mining is all taking place in places where power  is cheap, which is China; and where they've got the access to the best  computer chips, which is China.  And so China -- most bitcoin is mined in  China.  Most ether is mined in China.</p><p>XRP isn't being mined.  It was pre-mined, if you will.  So as a result it  uses virtually no power when it's, you know, compared to these other  things.  Running a node in the network is so much cheaper as a result.  And  there isn't any mining cost with that.  So it's a different kind of  technology as a result.</p><p>But countries like Singapore, countries like Switzerland, countries like  Thailand are working really hard to make sure that businesses develop there  around block chain.  The U.S. is starting to do some things.  The SEC has  started to try to figure some things out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But other countries aren't waiting and the entrepreneurs aren't  waiting to start business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  really exciting opportunity.</p><p>Cory -- thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  It's so good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You, too.  Great to have you -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We've known you a lot of years -- Cory Johnson.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  We're not that old?  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we're not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're still innovating.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Go figure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cory Johnson.</p><p>Coming up, Twitter's shadow ban -- some prominent conservatives are now  failing to appear in search results on the social media platform.  We've  got the story and the fall out coming next.</p><p>And then fighting free lunches -- why two San Francisco lawmakers are  trying to do away with free cafeterias at Silicon Valley technology  companies.  The story coming up.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.  Your top stories right now,  07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Facebook unfriended by investors this morning, take a look at the stock,  plummeting better than 20 percent.  The company taking a hit after  reporting disappointing sales and revenue guidance, the conference call had  lots of expectations and they fell short.  </p><p>It is just the tip of the iceberg for technology.  We've got Amazon and  Intel reporting this afternoon, those are the two to watch today.  Amazon  with some high expectations there, going into the quarter down 1-3/4  percent going in to the numbers.  </p><p>Futures this morning, indicating a mix opening.  The Dow Industrials are up  36 points right now but the NASDAQ is down 58 points as technology takes a  hit on the Facebook news.  </p><p>The markets ending the day yesterday higher.  Tensions over trade disputes  between the U.S. and the E.U. ease as the president spoke with the European  Commission President Mr. Juncker and said they are going to work toward an  agreement toward zero tariffs.  Markets rallied on that.  Dow Industrials  finished up 172 points.  The NASDAQ was up 91.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, money is moving into  stocks.  The DAX Index up better than one percent.  No real agreement on  autos and yet the DAX Index in Germany quite strong today, up better than  one percent.  CAC Quarante up quarter of a percent.  The FT-100 unchanged  as the European markets await the European Central Bank news this morning.  </p><p>Asian markets closing mostly in the red overnight.  Take a look, the KOSPI  was up three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>President Trump on Twitter declaring a big day for free and fair trade  after his meeting with the European Commission president.  The president  said that the goal would be zero tariffs.  I spoke with U.S. Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross earlier this morning to get his take.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY, U.S. COMMERCE:  Well, you notice on light trucks,  there was an exception for automotive products.  It said we'd work towards  zero tariffs on nonautomotive industrial products.  Steel and aluminum,  there's no attention to abandon those industries.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Twitter accused of hiding conservative voices in the  search results at the company.  The company taking heat this morning for  so-called \"shadow banning.\"  We will tell you all about it with the details  coming up.  </p><p>Then, local businesses are up in arms in San Francisco over free lunches at  technology companies.  They want to force workers to pay up, leave campus  to get food and pay for it.  The controversy, coming up.  </p><p>We're in the middle of the summer blockbuster season where there are big  movies, there is IMAX.  We are checking in to see surprises the company's  got in store for movie goers.  We'll check in with the IMAX CEO on earnings  and what's ahead.  </p><p>All that coming up, but first, Facebook shares, falling out of bed this  morning, that's for sure.  The stock down 20 percent on news from the  company's earnings report which basically opened up the idea that growth is  slowing down at Facebook as they invest more in security and privacy tools.  </p><p>Joining us right now on the telephone is Arete senior analyst Richard  Kramer.  Richard, great to have you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.   Your reaction to the Facebook news yesterday?  </p><p>RICHARD KRAMER, SENIOR ANALYST, ARETE (via telephone):  Well, I think we  had already had a growth slowdown from extremely high levels in our  numbers.  I don't think that was a big surprise.  The biggest surprise was  that Facebook is extremely happy to continue spending the kind of money it  does, both on cap-ex, on staff growth, on buybacks and so forth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- I mean, when you look at the kind of growth numbers that  we've been accustomed to at Facebook, 30 percent revenue growth, are those  days now in the rear view mirror?  Is that the issue here that we're not  going to see the kind of growth that we expected in the past?  </p><p>KRAMER:  I think you need to put this in the context of the law of large  numbers.  And Facebook ended last year at a $40 billion company.  And  finding an incremental 50 percent growth on top of that, which is the clip  that they were running at last year, is -- you know, finding another $20  billion of advertising revenue and that's just simply a very hard to do.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Richard, Lindsey Bell here.   Interesting, revenue per user was actually up, which I thought was kind of  a highlight, if you could find one.  But the real question we've talked  about all morning is Instagram, this is supposed to be the growth engine  for the company going forward.  How are they going to monetize it?  They've  kind of lagged there.  What do you see going forward with that?  </p><p>KRAMER:  I mean, Instagram is incredibly powerful platform.  And if you  look at brand like, Nike, that has 80 million followers on Instagram, where  else will it be able to tap into a global audience to directly market its  products to?  I wouldn't be overly concerned about that transition.  That's  something that we've written about earlier this year.  I think there's also  another important narrative which is Facebook is desperate to avoid  regulation, by showing -- saying that they're going to invest more and show  lower margins, they're creating a sort of oh, woe is me narrative around  the stock that hopefully will keep for them regulators at day.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Richard, it's Dagen McDowell  on Instagram, it's not the feeds per say and the ad revenue that that pulls  in, it was the ad revenue generated on the Instagram stories because  Facebook has predicted that activity on those stories, those photos and  videos that disappear after 24 hours, would eclipse the time spent just  scrolling through feeds next year.  How can they better monetize the ads  that are -- and activity in Instagram stories.  What do you expect them to  do?  </p><p>KRAMER:  Well, I think what you're -- I think what you're pointing out is  that story's clearly is a new format and they're transitioning to it and  they're willing to take the pain clearly as a company with $42 billion of  cash.  They can absorb quite a bit of that pain.  I think you have to give  them some time.  Because the next thing that will clearly be coming on  Instagram is shoppable icons that -- it will turn into -- rapidly turn into  an e-commerce platform alongside stories.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of directions they can take Instagram.  The focus right  now is on this transition to stories.  But that overlooks a whole range of  other options that they have with the platform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you buy the stock right here at 173 and change?  </p><p>KRAMER:  Well, we're obviously not supposed to talk about our ratings on  the air but we are -- we have a -- we have a positive view on the stock.  I  don't think that -- I don't think Facebook's days are completely over  because they're planning to spend more money.  I think if you look out  three, five years, and ask yourself will the platforms that they have still  be as relevant?  It's main Facebook may not be as relevant but Instagram  may be a lot more relevant.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Richard, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining the conversation this morning.  </p><p>KRAMER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard Kramer joining us.  </p><p>Turning now to Twitter being under fire.  The social media company facing  backlash for reportedly restricting the visibility of top Republicans, but  not Democrats, in its search results.  The technique is called shadow  banning.  And according to the Vice News, people like RNC Chair Ronna  McDaniel do not appear in Twitter's auto populated dropdown search box on  the site.  </p><p>McDaniel twitted about it yesterday writing this, the notion that social  media companies could suppress certain political points of view should  concern every American.  Twitter owns the public -- owes the public answers  to what's really going on.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Caldwell Strategic Consulting founder and Fox News  political analyst Gianno Caldwell.  Gianno, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  What do you think is going on?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this, Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, I mean, this comes as no surprise to me and many other  conservatives.  You think about what happened with Diamond and Silk with  (INAUDIBLE) members of congress being impacted by Facebook and other social  media networks who don't like the political speech of conservatives, it's  fairly problematic.  We've seen hearings on this on Capitol Hill.  I think  that it's now time for members of congress to take a deeper look and begin  to put regulations on these companies that do this, that really try to  interfere with the equitable actions of every American.  </p><p>So, whereas as you can be Louis Farrakhan and not be shadow banned or  impacted in any way, who obviously uses forms of hate speech or you can be  Madonna and threaten the president of the United States in ways.  These  individuals still have a social media presence that's glowing for their  viewers.  </p><p>So, why is it that conservatives who talk about being pro life, who talk  about other capitalism, why is it that they're being shadow banned?  This  is problematic on many levels and it's something that congress must take a  deeper look, a heightened look, I think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know when we had Kevin McCarthy on and other Republican  congressmen, they all said that -- you know, you don't want necessarily the  government to come in and start being big government on companies, right?   I don't think anybody wants that because we are in a free market.  What you  would like to see is competition come in and we'll see if this leads to  that.  Because, obviously, there's an issue here.  If Twitter is going to  censor conservative ideas.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One issue is -- and that's why Facebook is spending so much  money on privacy, that's why they're dedicating themselves to improving the  protections on the platform.  And they've been accused of censor --  obviously, censoring conservative content as well.  </p><p>But that's -- but they understand the danger of regulation.  Or they're  beginning to understand that.  </p><p>But in terms of the problem that you expressed with Ronna McDaniel, it's  still apparent, like this is something that Twitter could fix in  spontaneously.  If you put the name Ronna in the search, Ronna's got a  verified Twitter account.  But instead, the first results, if you put Ronna  in, you get somebody who has a verified account with a few thousand  followers, not 85,000 like Ronna McDaniel.  You get somebody with a  verified account with a few hundred.  </p><p>And by the way, I follow a lot of conservatives on Twitter and they follow  me back but they're not giving me that search result.  That's something  that Twitter could easily fix and so far they haven't done it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they haven't.  </p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  So, Gianno, this is Jack Brewer.  What  can influencers do, conservative minded influencers, what can we do to  really push forward this messaging?  Because at the end of the day, these  social media companies are dependent upon influencers.  That's where people  are going, that's who they're following.  And so, you know, I'm just trying  to figure out, come up with an idea on what steps we can take to make our  voices bigger?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  You know, interestingly enough, I think especially when it comes  to the shadow banning issue, there's been a lot of folks that have spoken  up.  That's the reason why we had those big hearings on Capitol Hill.  You  saw Diamond and Silk actually on Capitol Hill in a hearing where we had  this discussion.  Many of these social media companies have said that they  were taking steps to correct this.  But you continue to see the same issue  pop up time and time again.  </p><p>When we have the president of the United States who's a -- the biggest  government leader using this service.  And we know that there's other  government leaders who've been shadow banned as well, members of congress,  that's when it's necessities.</p><p>In my view, of course, we don't like regulation, competition is great, but  this is something that the government is fully using.  This is a -- this is  a spear where public dialogue is happening on a regular basis.  So yes,  it's great to have competition but it will take a while before competition  is able to compete with that kind of search profile, these social media  sites.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  So, yes, this is the time I think that we should be going in and  talking about listen, if you're not going to correct this, you made claims  time and time again, there should be some form of a penalty because there's  voices that are seriously being silenced.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quick, Jack Dorsey has been meeting privately a lot  of conservative thought leaders and having a lot of discussions.  But that  talk needs to turn into a walk in terms of the policies and the way that  Twitter is actually managed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it hasn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has not.  Gianno, good to get your insight.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Gianno Caldwell there.</p><p>Coming up, no such thing as a free lunch, right?  Well, why San Francisco  is now looking to ban free lavish cafeterias at technology companies, one  of the best perks for tech workers, that story coming up.  </p><p>Then, pump up the volume.  We are going deeper into the ultimate high  quality movie going experience with the CEO of IMAX, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A move to ban free lunches at technology company  cafeterias in an attempt to support local restaurants.  Gerri Willis with  the details now, Gerri.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's  right.  If you are one of the thousands of San Francisco workers used to  enjoying a free lunch every day at work, get ready for a change.  The  city's Board of Supervisors wants to ban the free lunch, saying it hurts  local restaurants.  Look, even the restaurants say they can't compete.  </p><p>Free lunches are a perk at big tech companies and offered by the likes of  Google, Twitter, but also Levi Strauss.  That's an old one.  There are 51  such employee cafeterias in San Francisco.  One supporter of the law  banning in house cafeterias said this \"We don't want employees biking or  driving to their office, staying there all day and going home.  This is  about getting people out of their office.\"</p><p>However, if the law is passive and only applied a new companies putting a  cafeteria is not existing once.  Well, the proposals in usual, it's not  without president.  Nearby Mountain View, California barred Facebook from  subsidizing on-site meals for 2,000 workers for the tech company offices.   Says one San Francisco restaurant to -- restaurant tour that it's hard to  compete with free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what?  I mean, companies are allowed to offer their  employees whatever they want.  I mean, this is basically to me big  government telling companies how to do their business.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Or just mouthy small government, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  It's a board of supervisors here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, a board of supervisors.  Local city supervisors telling  technology companies how to pay their employees.  That's a perk that  companies have a right to give.  </p><p>BREWER:  And what about the food service companies, right?  They're most  the -- most of them are outsourcing us.  So you have you know, major food  service companies now that are going to be losing contracts and it makes no  sense.  Another thing, why don't they just charge them a quarter, come eat  a full meal, a quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's good.  Then the local restaurants will have to  compete with that.  </p><p>BREWER:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why, I can't figure out why some of these companies haven't  moved to more free market cities?  I know that all the talent is in Silicon  Valley and in San Francisco.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, they have moved south, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And some of them have moved to Texas which is a no income tax  state, maybe even -- I know, I think Zappos is based in Las Vegas, of all  places.  But that's owned by Amazon.  </p><p>But I'll point out, again, it's because these bureaucrats think they know  better --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- than people who have created some of the greatest companies  in the history of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why they're getting the (INAUDIBLE) that they're  getting.  Because they got all these perks.  So what?  They're allowed.  </p><p>WILLIS:  What if you're an employee of one of these companies and city hall  saying we're going to take this away from you.  I would really be pissed.   Is this really going to help them?  I don't think so.  This is exactly like  the big debate three years ago over busses, Google busses.  Local groups  complained hey, this is texploitation.  They're there ganking up major  arteries in the city. </p><p>By the way, it was free to the city to transport Google employees.  They  didn't have to pay for city busses --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>WILLIS:  -- to get people anywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.  I think we all agree.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Listen, I lived in San Francisco --</p><p>BELL:  Keep out of the business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for less than a year and I hated it for that very reason.  </p><p>WILLIS:  We were there at the same time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we we're there at the same --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  City officials -- City officials trying to tell businesses how  to run their businesses.  Gerri, thank you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of technology, President Trump is just tweeting this,  he says this, Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.  </p><p>Yes, we were just talking about this, obviously.  We're going to take a  short break.  When we come back, blockbusters on the big, big screen.</p><p>I'm talking to the CEO of IMAX next hour about his company's high quality  theater experience and summer movie going surprises.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a clip, that was a clip from \"Mission: Impossible- Fallout\".  The sixth installment of the wildly successful franchise of  \"Mission Impossible\".  The Tom Cruise led blockbuster is the latest IMAX  offering.  It hit screens nationwide tomorrow -- tonight.  </p><p>IMAX meanwhile, reporting second quarter earnings last night in earnings  per share $00.30 on 98.3 million revenue.  EPS beating expectations with  revenue narrowly missing expectations.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of IMAX, Richard Gelfond.  Richard, it's  great to see you.  </p><p>RICHARD GELFOND, CEO, IMAX:  Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GELFOND:  I'm happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good quarter.  </p><p>GELFOND:  Very good quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What drove the quarter?  </p><p>GELFOND:  Well, first of all, the second quarter was the highest box office  quarter in the history of the movie business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>GELFOND:  Somewhat surprising, people think it's somewhat stagnant industry  but it's actually still growing.  And IMAX's case, what we do is global  blockbusters.  So, a large majority of our revenues were international.  We  did over $100 million in China in box office, over $100 million  domestically and over $100 million in the rest of the world.  We were  firing on all cylinders.  I think the public has an appetite for these  blockbusters in a premium way and that's where IMAX's fits.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's really important information that you're giving us.   Because the international story is such an important growth story for so  many companies, IMAX included.  You haven't been caught up in this tariff  fight with China.  </p><p>GELFOND:  No, we haven't.  You know, I don't think we will either.  And  some of the reasons for that, Maria, are it's been a very good relationship  between Hollywood and China.  So Hollywood's made a lot of money exporting  its films to China.  We have a separate public company in China that's  worth over $1 billion, a big business.  We do a big part of the Chinese box  office.  And for the Chinese, they're portrayed in a different way than  they were years ago.  </p><p>So, they're not the bad guys anymore and they're not -- you know, the  communist enemies.  They're portrayed, you look at movies like \"The  Martian\" or you look at movies like \"The Great Wall\", in a very favorable  way.  So, I don't think China wants to poke an eye at Hollywood right now.   I don't think that works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you have to give up any of your technology, did you have to  give up any of the secrets of IMAX in order to get your company -- you  know, in a foothold in China?  </p><p>GELFOND:  We didn't.  And we didn't -- initially, we didn't grow with  Chinese partners.  We did it ourselves.  On the other hand though, we had  an ugly episode about seven or eight years ago where someone, a former  employee stole some of our technology and they were backed by the Chinese  government.  And it was drawn out.  </p><p>So, you know, I think the government has something there when they talk  about protecting the theft of I.P.  And I think China's a real world power  now.  They're not a disrupter.  They're the status quo.  They have more  engineers than anyone graduating in the world.  And I think they have to be  part of the world community and protect I.P.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The best part of IMAX is the experience.  That's why you're  seeing the growth you are in Saudi Arabia.  In China you're looking at  building and expanding, throughout the Middle East.  </p><p>Tell us what's on top in terms of the big movies and also what you're  expecting in terms of the Middle East and where the growth comes from next.  </p><p>GELFOND:  Well, Saudi Arabia is a promising market.  It just opened up to  cinema a few months ago.  And we are the second theater -- commercial  theater ever in Saudi Arabia with Vox, AMC opened the first commercial  theater there.  India's a very big growth market for us now.  We have -- I  think, 35 theaters in the Middle East today.  They love the Western movies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, fantastic.  </p><p>GELFOND:  \"Black Panther\" played amazing in the Middle East.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That did very well.  And I know you have \"Aqua Man\" coming up,  you've got the Fantastics.  </p><p>GELFOND:  \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The \"Fantastic Beasts\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Ant-Man\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, you're going to be our special guest this weekend in  Wall Street.  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  Richard -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  July 26th. END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  Facebook unfriended on Wall Street.  Take a look  at the stock plunging on disappointing sales and revenue guidance.  Nearly  $150 billion wiped out of market value in the after-hours trading session  for Facebook. </p><p>The stock is down better than 20 percent right now.  That sell-off setting  the tone for the rest of the technology sector.  The biggest names in tech  under pressure this morning.  Amazon will report after the close going into  the numbers.  The stock is down 1-1/4 percent.  Twitter and Snap both down  better than three percent.  Broader markets this morning mixed.  Take a  look at futures indicating a gain to the Dow, but a loss for the NASDAQ.   Dow Industrials up 44 points right now. </p><p>S&amp;P 500 is down five and the NASDAQ down 52 points.  That's by the way is  off of the lows of the morning down three quarters of a percent on NASDAQ.   It was a wild session on Wall Street yesterday in the final 30 minutes of  trading.  We had a huge surge on reports of a softening trade dispute  between the U.S. and the E.U.  President Trump and European Commission  President Jean-Claude Juncker putting new tariffs on hold as they work to  negotiate a trade deal. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The European Union is going  to start almost immediately to buy a lot of soybeans.  They're a tremendous  market buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers.  These will open markets for  farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in  both the United States and the European Union. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are taking a look at the key issues at stake this morning  coming up.  Checking global markets this morning, Europe is mixed.  The  European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged.  That was expected.   But investors are waiting on ECB President Mario DraghI's news conference  that happens later this hour.  We are looking for guidance on rising rates  and the end of stimulus there.  CAC Quarante is up a quarter of a percent. </p><p>DAX Index in German up one and a quarter percent this morning.  In Asia  overnight, markets are mostly lower.  As you can see there, China was the  weakest.  The Shanghai Composite down three quarters of a percent.  And  explosion near the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  The only person injured was  the bomber who allegedly set off the device.  We have the very latest on  that investigation coming up.  And Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones standing firm  in his support for the national anthem. </p><p>He says all players will be required to stand.  Plus, the end of an era.   The new owner of Necco Wafers shutting down a factory.  What it means for  your candy favorites coming up.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, former NFL star and The Brewer Group CEO, Jack Brewer, and CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  A really big show today guys with lot  of news.  Good morning. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  A lot of news and it looks like  I've been just walking the bottom of the screen.  A lot of earnings coming  out of beatings, so I like that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  McDonald's the latest beating earnings estimates in terms of  earnings and revenue. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the news out of the White  House with meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker from Europe was certainly a  relief to investors.  You saw what the market did yesterday.  It's a de- escalation of the trade fight at least starting with Europe, an important  trading partner, a tariff truce, maybe no new tariffs say on automobiles.   That will be good news.  But, again, I think it goes to Steve Forbes'  point.  You saw the market reaction.  If we weren't having this trade fight  in some way, the market would be higher than it is already. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.  And last night, you know, we know that the  steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place, but they've agreed that  there won't be additional tariffs right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  While they work out a broader trade deal that Europe also  agreeing to buy more soybeans that will help offset at least some of the  pain from that fight that we've got into that we've entered into with  China.  And also it looks like natural gas.  Again, you -- that goes a huge  way to offsetting the power that Russia is trying to claim. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And right now they have an outline of all this going.  They're  going to turn this into an agreement apparently.  Joining the conversation  this morning Energy Secretary Rick Perry is joining us today to talk about  that in terms of what kind of business can be done between the E.U. and  America when it comes to energy, South Dakota Congresswoman Kristi Noem is  with us this morning, along with Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star Pitcher, Ross  Stripling is here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney weighs in  as well. </p><p>Big show ahead.  Don't miss it.  And we kick it off right here with this  top story.  And Facebook slide bringing down all the big technology names  this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange looking at the market that is watching tick slow down, Nic. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Absolutely.  Good morning,  Maria.  So when we're watching Facebook dragging down all the tech stocks  dragging down ETF's and while we see the Dow up more than 40 points.  Good  news on tariffs talk.  But ultimately, this is going to weigh.  Let's break  this down.  So when you talk about what you saw in Facebook and when I was  talking to the analyst this morning, Joe Collina, over at Wedbush. </p><p>You see it's down 20 percent, OK.  This basically takes Facebook from  record territory yesterday into bear market territory, and missed on  everything, revenues, daily active users, monthly active users, cash on  operations, advertising guidance, and guidance.  OK.  With that what really  wild Wall Street in a negative way.  It was first (INAUDIBLE) Sandberg and  then the CFO David Winger comes on, and basically gives the outlook.  And  what really led Joe Collina to be really surprised is that he feels that  there are serious credibility issues with this management lying to  investors. </p><p>We were told there would be no impact from privacy.  And in fact, that is  not the case.  In fact, you heard from David Weiner saying that the outlook  would fall significantly and he said that the outlook is somewhat severe.   There are others who are still positive in rating the stock just fine.  But  this is a sell-off and it will drag all the other social media and ETFs  down along with it.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hi, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides looking into  market that will opening mixed this morning.  In just about an hour,  President Trump will leave to talk workforce optimism in the Midwest.  This  as some U.S. companies say that the steel and aluminum tariffs will hurt  more than they will help.  Earlier, I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The impact of steel and  aluminum on the auto industry's cost is really fairly minor.  It's about  one percent on the cost of the vehicle.  So to the degree that that might  be passed along, that's possible. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake Burman is live at the White House with the very latest.   Here and, Blake, what a reaction to the president's press conference with  Mr. Juncker yesterday? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  And we  all hear from the president later today, Maria, as he is set to leave the  White House here later this hour.  He's on the road two stops today, Iowa  and to Illinois, and it is at that second stop where the president will  indeed give a speech on trade and, of course, comes one day after the  president hosted the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude  Juncker here at the White House for two and a half hours. </p><p>That meeting culminated with an impromptu semi-press conference I guess you  could say in the Rose Garden yesterday in which those two essentially said  that they are going to try to avert a trade war.  The E.U. says it will buy  more soybeans from the U.S. for example while the president suggested that  he is willing to back off steel and aluminum tariffs for the E.U. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We also will resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues and we  will resolve retaliatory tariffs.  We have some tariffs that are  retaliatory and that will get resolve this part of what we're doing. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Now, companies as you know are citing the steel and aluminum  tariffs as a major headwind.  Yesterday alone for example, Coca-Cola  announced that it will raise prices in North America while G.M., Ford, and  FiatChrysler all lowered profit forecasts for the year all citing tariffs.   Now, just before the president and Jean-Claude Juncker met here at the  White House to try to lower the volume if nothing else on this back-and- forth emerging trade tit-for-tat. </p><p>The Chinese President Xi Jinping weighed in a speech yesterday.  This was  his warning.  He said, \"A trade war should be rejected because there will  be no winner.\"  Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us now to talk more about that is South Dakota  Congresswoman Kristi Noem, a member of the House on Ways and Means  Committee who attended a trade meeting with the president yesterday at the  White House.  Congresswoman, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us. </p><p>REP. KRISTI NOEM (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Thank you for having me on today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what we have from the European leader and  President Trump in terms of this agreement.  They're calling it an outline,  not an out-and-out agreement. </p><p>NOEM:  Well, it was a good day yesterday and a great announcement for the  farmers in South Dakota, the farmers across this country that Europe is  going to immediately begin buying soybeans which is a new market for us  that has opened up that we can get more of a -- of a market to sell across  the globe.  So I think that is a good indication of what can happen as we  continue to talk to other countries.  This president has been aggressive  and making sure that we have more fair agreements, and bringing people to  the table to make sure that it is beneficial not only for farmers and  ranchers. </p><p>But for all of those involved in industries that have been struggling, and  from decades of unfair treatment. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But just to be clear, the aluminum and steel tariffs are still  in place and it is impacting the growth story and the number of  corporations. </p><p>NOEM:  It is.  You know, we certainly saw a lot of growth and we still  continue to see growth.  In fact, I think we'll have good numbers tomorrow  when they're released.  But, you know, these tariffs have brought people to  the table.  We have had years of unfair treatment.  I think that the  president is keeping his eye on the ball by making sure that he's breaking  down those barriers and getting people to give us better treatment across  the globe. </p><p>And, you know, he said yesterday to us clearly in the -- in the cabinet  room that he doesn't like tariffs.  But he's going to use them to make sure  that we're treated fairly in the future. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, who's next?  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  Who's next  in terms of because again this is still a deal in Europe that has to be  worked out with the more than two dozen nations across the whole of Europe  and in Germany and France have very different goals in terms of trade with  the United States, who's next?  Will it be Mexico?  Will it be a bilateral  deal, a full reworking of NAFTA?  And how soon will we see that? </p><p>NOEM:  You know, I spent a lot of time working on trade since I've been in  Congress and we've had great briefings the last couple of weeks with the  trade ambassador, with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue who's been aggressive in  recognizing how our farmers and ranchers need to get through this difficult  time.  We've had great discussions with the White House.  I think that  these agreements will start to come more rapidly now, now that we've seen  European come and give us a better playing field and give us another market  for soybeans that Mexico could be next. </p><p>When Mexico comes to an agreement with us in the next 30 to 60 days which  is what I'm hoping for.  That brings Canada in with better faith, efforts  than what they've demonstrated so far, so the news is positive.  And we're  going the right direction and that's what I've appreciated is this  president is by far our best negotiator that we've seen in decades.  He has  recognized the problem and the reason that farmers and ranchers are in a  tough situation today is because we've been living through four to five  years of record low commodity prices because previous administration didn't  care to have this fight. </p><p>This president is wanting to break down those barriers and get fair  agreements for us, open up new markets for our farmer and ranchers and  that's what's he's doing through all of these negotiation tactics. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined this morning and said  tariffs are starting to have effect on China in fact.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSS:  You see these repeated announcements coming out of China things that  they're doing with the banking system, bolstering capital, bolstering  liquidity.  Clearly they're feeling pressure from the tariffs that the  president has put on. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of pressure there, congresswoman.  But is it  going to be enough to actually change China's behavior, the thief of  intellectual property, the forced transfer of technology?  </p><p>NOEM:  I believe it will.  We've seen that when they have come back against  us by us forcing them to have more open-handed discussions with us, they  have come back in very politically motivated ways to try to punish our  farmer and ranchers.  They have been targeted in how they've gone after the  United States, and that shows that they recognize how important this fight  is, and how unfair they've been to us for decades.  So this president has  gone to bat for business and businesses and people and families across the  country by giving us tax reform, by giving us relief from regulations that  we're burdening our economy. </p><p>Now, he's fighting for more markets and more fair agreements.  This is  something that we need to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that we're  bringing people to the table, and making China give us a better open  agreement than what we've had in the past.  The trade deficit we've had  with China has been unacceptable for a long time and this president  recognizes that it needs to be rectified. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the other deficit that we talked about, a trillion  dollar deficits.  I know you're working on tax cuts 2.0 there in the House  Ways and Means Committee, what's your timeline there?  And do you worry  that paying for it is going to be a challenge? </p><p>NOEM:  You know, we're seeing growth in the economy which is exactly what  we knew we would see from tax reform.  That's why we're pursuing tax reform  2.0 to give permanence to individual rates, to continue to incentivized  families, to be successful into the future.  So we know what effects have  been already from the first step that we've taken to have 2.0 happen right  now will continue to grow this economy, give more people money in their  pockets, so they can be successful, and then help our treasury as well  continue to recovery by growth and businesses in revenues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much. </p><p>NOEM:  Thank you for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Kristi Noem joining us there.  Coming up, a blast  in Beijing.  The latest developments after a man detonates an explosive  device right outside of the U.S. Embassy.  The Jerry Jones standing up for  the national anthem.  The details as the Cowboys owner is bowing his team  will be required to stand during the anthem.  Back in the moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tech under pressure as Facebook is selling off 20 percent right  now.  McDonald's also reporting earnings this morning.  Cheryl Casone with  all the details there, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  How did breakfast do at  McDonald's, right, Maria?  Another stock to watch to your point.  They  reported better than expected results for their second quarter.  Same-store  sales in the U.S rising 2.6 percent global same-store sales climbing four  percent, all of that beating analyst forecasts thanks to the company's  popular value menu and, of course, breakfast.  Still having breakfast at  McDonald's. </p><p>Shares of McDonald's though, they are under precious at the premarket  slightly down about a quarter of a percent, so that's one name to watch  today.  We're also looking at Allergan set to open higher after results  beat the street.  The company announcing a new two billion dollar stock  buyback program.  The stock is trading higher ahead of the opening bell.   As you can see almost two percent.  American Airlines parent out with mixed  earnings. </p><p>Right now, earnings per share beat the street's estimate, but revenue fell  short of expectation.  That might be due to higher oil prices by the way.   American also cutting capacity guidance for the third and the fourth  quarters.  Capacity very important to airline analyst.  Shares of American  are lower in the premarket down about three-quarters of a percent.  Now,  the headline we're following this morning for you, a bomb exploding near  the U.S. Embassy in Beijing overnight. </p><p>Police there say the blast injured the 26-year-old man who was holding the  device.  It was made out of fireworks.  Authorities say that the suspect is  from Mongolia.  His motive remains completely unclear.  The U.S. Embassy  was not damaged and thankfully, no one else was hurt.  Well, Nielsen CEO  Mitch Barns is retiring at the end of the year.  Barns became CEO of the  data analytics firm back in 2014.  Companies work plan to start a search  for a new CEO immediately.  Shares of Nielsen sharply lower actually in the  premarket right now on the news down 20 percent, so that's another stock to  watch today.  </p><p>Then finally, there is this.  Oh, boy.  You know those really popular  Valentine's Day candy hearts that we get.  Those.  Well, they could be in  jeopardy.  Necco that makes them has unexpectedly shut down operations at  its Massachusetts plant and they haven't even said if candy production is  going to continue at all. </p><p>Nearly 230 workers were shocked to hear the news.  They were told when to  pick up their final paycheck.  Necco was purchased by an investment company  for $17.3 million dollars at a bankruptcy auction in May and says it has  now sold the company to another buyer, so that buyer is watching.  Please  keep our candy hearts.  Necco knowingly a confectionary company is the  country's oldest continuously operating candy company, so some history  there as well, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Feel that sugar. </p><p>CASONE:  I love it.  Wow.  The video backup makes me smile. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) we think about the workers too.  We think about job  losses.  Wait.  That's not lost on us.  We came from hardworking stock of  small business owners, and so that's why when we talk about tariffs, I get  so passionate about it because I know that there are negative consequences  for some American workers and small business owners.  So, again, there's  balance.  That's what we aim for. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  When we come back, tracking a missing  college student's digital footprint, how Fitbit and Snapchat could help  with the search coming up.  Then, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowing his team  will stand for the national anthem.  Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star pitcher  Ross Stripling is here weighing in.  Plus, he's a stockbroker.  Back in a  minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From baseball to business, my next guest is an  all-star pitcher for the L.A. Dodgers who is also happens to be a licensed  stockbroker.  Joining us right now is Ross Stripling.  Ross, great to see  you.  Thanks for joining us. </p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, PITCHER, LOS ANGELES DODGERS:  Hey, guys.  Thanks for  having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we have a lot of questions for you from baseball to  business.  What -- first off, what made you decide to become a stockbroker? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Right.  You know, just took at an interest at a young age,  studied it in college, and when I got drafted, you get a sign bonus from  the Los Angeles Dodgers.  And remember asking my dad, I was like, you know,  I need to get in with your -- with your money guys.  I mean figure out  where to -- where to put this money and he was like, well, I don't know.   It's a good opportunity for you to learn how to do it yourself and ended up  investing my own signing bonus by myself and just kind of fell in love with  the market. </p><p>And as I was going up through the minor leagues, I had a Tommy John surgery  which forced me in this 14 months of my baseball career, and from there  just kind of didn't know if baseball is going to be my future, so I tried  to find something to fall back on and that's when I got in with B. Riley  who sponsored me to take my serious step and my 66, and became a licensed  stockbroker.  And that's, you know, how I kind of got here today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, good for you.  That's terrific.  We've got Jack Brewer on  the -- on the set today with us from the NFL.  And, you know, we've talked  about in the past how athletes make a lot of money and then they lose it  because they don't know how to apply it.  They don't know to save and grow  it, Jack. </p><p>JACK BREWER, FOUNDER, THE BREWER GROUP COMPANIES:  Yes.  Well, Ross set an  example, you know, Ross, I grew up in your neighboring Grapevine, Texas.  I  went to Grapevine High School.  I know you went to Southlake, so I had to  put that out there.  But as, you know, two Texas boys that -- it's a --  it's really good to see what you're doing.  You know, I had a similar story  man playing in the National Football League and I got hurt for the sixth  time. </p><p>Actually, sixth surgery and I went and got my broker's licensed, so I mean  I applaud you and your effort.  You're only 28 years old.  Tell me a little  bit.  How is it the response have been from your teammates?  Are you able  to take, you know, your example and really show other players that you  played with or other guys that may be in the league?  How have they  responded? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I think that's originally one of the main  reasons why I wanted to do it is, you know, like you said, around a lot of  guys that make a lot of money and they may not necessarily understand it.   It's a very complicated subject and, you know, there's a lot of moving  parts and then I wanted to be able to help in the locker room when guys had  questions about certain things where their money is, why it might be there  that, you know, maybe they're not comfortable asking their broker for  whatever reason or they just don't have time, and I'm much more convenient. </p><p>I'm right there.  And the response has been great.  Guys seems like I get a  question or two every day from different guys asking about just a wide  array of things from municipal bonds to the equities that they're in and  all sorts of stuff.  So that's the most -- one of the most fun things for  me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what would you do with Facebook this morning? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Man, yes.  That's going to be ugly opening, huh?  That's going  to be down like below 170, so I don't know.  I'm certainly going to be  watching it and I don't -- I haven't had a good chance to buy Facebook like  that in a while down to 170, so we'll see. </p><p>BELL:  Hey, Ross, it's Lindsey Bell.  I'm just wondering, you know, what  has been your best stock pick to date and what do you think about the  markets where we're out here, you know, we're kind of getting along into  the tooth in this bull market? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Right.  Well you know, the last time I did something like this,  I used an individual name and I got a bunch of trouble, so I'm going to --  I'm going to stay away from using an individual name.  But I'm extremely  bullish.  I'm always bullish.  It's just not in my nature to be bearish and  root for anything to go down unless they're playing football against my  aggies I guess.  But, you know, obviously, there's some good things going  on with the union, European Union right now, decrease in tariffs. </p><p>It looks like maybe getting rid of that trade war a little bit, so in the  short-term definitely some good things that Trump is doing in my opinion.   And but for me, I'm always bullish, always looking for stuff in the long  run, always looking for kind of some small and midcap disrupters in the  tech industry, or kind of what I'm looking for the most part, and just  things that I believe in, you know, moving forward in the long run that are  going to be around for a long time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So you like the stock market.  What about this  controversial national anthem protest story?  Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones  says that he's going to require his team to stand during the national  anthem.  This hasn't been an issue for the MLB we know.  But what do you  make of the environment right now? </p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, I'm certainly glad that hasn't made its way to  the MLB like you said.  You know, that's obviously been a very  controversial thing and something that I'm glad that we haven't had to take  much part in.  But, you know, as a Cowboys fan, I respect Jerry Jones  taking the initiative and wanting guys to stand up for the anthem.   Obviously, I understand where guys are coming from when they protest and,  you know, like I said, glad that baseball is kind of been able to stay away  from it.   But, you know, look, look forward to seeing guys stand for the national  anthem, obviously, that might be continuing thing moving forward.  But we  'll see how it goes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Ross, good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much. </p><p>STRIPLING:  Cash. Thank you, guys.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us there.  Comuing up, Energy Secretary  Rick Perry will join me.  He'll weigh in on trade, tariffs, energy,  business with the E.U., and a lot more.  Plus, a new take on smart  clothing, how Tommy Hilfiger will reward customers for wearing its  merchandise, coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, July 26th.   Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the east coast.  The Bears taking a  swipe at Facebook in the premarket this morning.  The social media giant  getting hammered, down 20 percent right now, after reporting disappointing  sales and revenue guidance, $150 billion in market value wiped out in the  extended hours last night after the company's conference call on earnings.</p><p>More technology stocks reporting today, Amazon and Intel, reporting this  afternoon, Amazon right after the closing bell.  That's going to be one to  watch today.  Down 1-1/3 percent going into those numbers.  We are an hour  away from the opening bell this morning, and Futures are indicating a mixed  start to trading.  We're just getting the durable goods number out.  The  durable goods report just hitting the wire coming in well below analysts'  expectations, durable goods up one percent last month, versus an estimate  of three percent, not a major reaction, though, from markets, NASDAQ still  down 50 points, that's largely on weakness in tech on the heels of  Facebook, Dow Industrials up 43 points.  Off of the highs but nonetheless  showing a gain on the Dow.</p><p>In Europe, this morning, we heard from the European Central Bank which left  interest rates unchanged.  The DAX Index in Germany up 1-1/3 percent, it's  been strong all morning on a -- on a deal with the E.U., and the U.S.  The  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent, the FT-100 in London  flat.  The Asian markets closed mostly in the red overnight with the  exception of Korea, that was up three-quarters of one percent.  </p><p>The end of tariffs troubles on the horizon, president trump detailing his  plan with the European Commission President after yesterday's meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  This is why we agreed today, first of all, to work together towards  zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto  industrial goods.  We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade  and services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as  soybeans.  Soybeans is a big deal!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President calling it a big day for free and fair trade.   Meanwhile, Snapchat (INAUDIBLE) investigators are turning to Snapchat and  Fitbit to help in a search for a college student missing since July 18th.   Authorities are hoping the data can help them pinpoint her location.  Big  Tommy is watching you, apparently, Tommy Hilfiger, taking their rewards  program to the 21st century.  The company's new line features smart chip  technology in the clothes, gives you points every time you wear their  clothes, I guess they're tracking you as well.  </p><p>Poor Paul, House Speaker Paul Ryan taking a page from Jimmy Kimmel's book  reading some mean tweets about himself.  And they don't pull any punches.   We'll have that for you also, coming up.  Right now, though, America  charges forward with energy production.  The United States looks to secure  its place as the world's leading producer of oil and natural gas.  The  first natural gas liquification facility on the east coast is being  dedicated today.  It comes less than a day after the President strikes a  major energy deal with the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas, LNG,  from the United States, and they're going to be a very, very big buyer, so  they'll be able to diversify their energy supply which they want very much  to do, and we have plenty of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now, with an exclusive look at the new  facility is Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Mr. Secretary, it's good to see  you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  You're welcome, Maria.   It's a beautiful place out here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are leading the dedication of this new plant today.   How important is the new plant to this trade deal and easing trade tensions  with the E.U.?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, obviously, this is one of a total of six.  We've got two that  are up and running right now, four that are in some part of being completed  and ready to be selling U.S. LNG across the world.  But this is a fabulous  opportunity to send a message.  I was in Belgium about two weeks ago  talking to my counterparts in the E.U., as I'd also talked to some folks  from other parts of the world as well.  But they know that we have this  extraordinary supply.  What's happened in the energy secretary is  phenomenal, from the standpoint of production or liquefied natural gas, and  it has multiple impacts, obviously, for national security in America.  </p><p>The idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply but  also to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for  the E.U. President yesterday, this isn't just about an economic thing for  the United States, it's about the supply and the security of our allies in  the European theater.  They don't have to sit there and be held hostage  with just one supply of gas.  The United States where there's going to be  going into Poland, where there's going to be coming in to the southern part  of the European Union.  They can rest assured that the United States is  going to be there, be a supplier with no strings attached of liquefied  natural gas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what kind of a deal are we talking about?  I mean, because  I know that the President pushed back at the NATO meeting just a couple  weeks ago, basically said look, we're protecting you from Russia and you're  buying your gas from Russia.  So, is this -- is he going to take some of  that market share?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, absolutely.  That's what we intend to do.  The Nord Stream II  and the Turkish Stream which coming in from the south.  Neither one of  those are commercially viable.  They're there so that Russia can be the  sole supplier of energy for the European Union.  The vast majority of the  E.U. understands that, and they're not for those two lines as well.   Germany is, I think Austria has a tendencies to be for it as well because  they've got a company that is going to help construct it, but the final  decision-making process, I think the Europeans recognize fully that the  United States is a supplier of LNG, that they want to have, and it does a  multitude of things, not only does it give them some security from a  national security standpoint, it also will have a massive positive impact  upon the environment.  </p><p>We've seen that right here in the United States with over the last decade,  14 percent decrease in our carbon emissions, and that's what the Europeans  are really focused on as well.  So, they can two things that are really  good for them, national security, and helping their environment, and the  United States and our LNG is going to be a major player with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about Dominion Energy Cove Point LNG.  This is the  second natural gas liquification facility to enter service and the first to  be built on the east coast.  Tell us the significance of it and what kind  of production you're expecting here?</p><p>PERRY:  Yes, in an international partnership, Japan and India are both our  partners in this plan, as you can see right over my shoulder, there's a  tanker that's waiting to be filled, and sent on its way.  When I was over  in India earlier in the year, we had a -- we had a load of gas coming in to  India for the first time, so these are amazing times, but the message is  clear.  The United States is blessed because of innovation, hydraulic  fracturing and our ability to directionally drill to have access to the  shale gas, an unconventional play.  It is putting America in a place that  we haven't been in 60 years, a net exporter of natural gas.  </p><p>So, geopolitically, you think about, Maria, five years ago, where we were  from the standpoint of being reliant upon some countries who didn't  necessarily have our best interests in mind to today being the largest oil  and gas producer in the world.  A stunning turnaround and anyone who would  argue that that's bad for the United States, and we're going to be able to  -- on the environmental side -- I think again, it can't be understated how  much of an impact it has to take those old inefficient plants off that are  running in China, in India, and in Germany, for that matter, replace it  with LNG, and I will suggest that for the Germans and for anyone else, the  best interest there is in American LNG not relying upon the Russians as  their sole source.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has talked a lot about the price of oil and about  manipulation going on in the market.  Do you see more production impacting  oil prices as well?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, here is the real issue from my perspective, the United States  can fill the pipelines around the world, as a matter of fact, we fill the  pipelines so much in United States that that's our limiting factor.  Going  out of the Permian Basin into the world market, it is restricted at this  particular point in time because we don't have the pipeline capacity.  So,  building those pipelines, getting the spigot open in a bigger way from my  perspective and I think from the President as well, is a clear message that  that's the way to help address the price of crude, let's get more in the  market, it's just a plain economic standpoint of supply and demand.  And  when there's a huge demand out there right now, lower restrictions in our  pipelines, but over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll be opening them up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on this, Russian hackers reportedly  infiltrated a network of electric utilities last year, it's according to  The Wall Street Journal, a Department of Homeland Security official said  that it could have led to blackouts or even worse, how serious is the risk  for hackers to be successful in the near future, Sir?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, it's obviously a real concern that we have, you know, five  years ago, this wasn't something we're particularly worried about, but over  -- I mean, literally millions of times a month, you will see companies that  are being hit, particularly these electrical control panels.  The sector- specific agency that has the responsibility for that is the Department of  Energy.  So, we're working on it, we stood up a new office called Caesar  with cybersecurity as being the real focus there.  Tuesday, I'm going to be  in New York City with the Secretary of Homeland Security and some other  folks who have cybersecurity in their portfolios as well to talk about the  United States and our focus upon cybersecurity in this country.  It is  real, but we've got some of the best in the world that are doing their due  diligence at our national labs to come up with the defensive and the  offensive ways to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Iran, America is pressuring its allies to stop  importing oil from Iran ahead of the reinstated sanctions next week.  Iran  is threatening unspecified countermeasures.  What might they be?  Your  reaction to Iran.</p><p>PERRY:  Maria, the President has been very straightforward, he's been very  blunt with the Iranians.  The destabilization of the Middle East and other  places around the world, he's just not going to put up with it.  And  whatever we need to do to send a message that Iran can be -- you know, they  can -- they can be participants in the world order, they can be  participants in that part of world and do it in a civil and a peaceful  thoughtful way.  If they don't, the President has been very clear, there  will be powerful sanctions, there will be strong pushback from United  States and our allies, sending the message -- this isn't about the Iranian  people, this is about the leadership in that country, the revolutionary  guard in particular, you know, act decent in the world you live in and you  can expect to do business with the United States.  If you don't, there will  be hell to pay. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, he has been very clear.  Secretary, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>PERRY:  Good.  Maria, so long.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it, Secretary Rick Perry joining us there.   Coming up, getting rewarded for wearing clothes, how Tommy Hilfiger is  giving customer prices for wearing its brand, coming up.  Then Paul Ryan  poking some fun at himself, the House Speaker's hilarious response to  reading mean tweets about himself, later this hour.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets cheering the thaw in trade tensions  between the U.S. and the European Union, following President Trump's  discussion with E.U. Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker.  We want to talk  more about that in a minute.  We're going to welcome Stuart Varney.  By the  way, yesterday, Stuart said all I want to see is Juncker and President  Trump walk out with smiles and be happy, and the markets are going to turn,  and that's exactly what happened.</p><p>BELL:  Sounds like is exactly what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at the big reaction at the -- after the close.</p><p>BELL:  There was.  I would have like to see --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, even before the close, sorry.</p><p>BELL:  -- more clarity on the auto tariffs, but you know, this is a great  step in the right direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, let's bring in Stuart Varney who called it,  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you called it.  This time  yesterday, you and I posed the question, what happens if we get some good  news on trade, does the market pop?  I said, yes.  I think you said, yes,  too, Maria.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But you -- but you had the idea, and that was a great  idea.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's true, that's exactly what the market wanted, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, that's right.  And now, there may be a little bit of a follow  on today.  May I remind you that there's a delegation from Mexico in D.C.  right now, talking trade, they want to wrap up a trade deal, a bilateral  trade deal, you could possibly get some more smiling faces, not necessarily  the news conference, but some smiley faces when they walk out of the  meeting.  That could mean another small leg up for the overall market.   But, to me, the most important thing in that trade deal is that they, the  Europe (AUDIO GAP) take that China, and they're going to take a lot of our  energy, natural gas, take that Russia.  Seems to me that the Europeans  blinked and Trump won again.  That's the way it seems to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes.  We'll see.  I mean, they said that they're going to  work towards zero tariffs, but let's not forget the aluminum and steel  tariffs are still in place, and they said also, Dagen, that it's non-auto.   That's really what the sticking point was, the auto (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That rally was purely based on the fact that this is a de- escalation of tensions, it is a truce on additional tariffs, particularly  the threat of tariffs on the European automobile imports.  But, again,  we're still watching because these steel and aluminum tariffs -- what?</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, look, you're not going to have a tit-for-tat escalation with  Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, right.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's not going to happen, they agreed not to do that yesterday.   That was the heart of the good news.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But as one of our viewers just --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's when markets rallied -- yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As one of our viewers just tweeted, it's time for more go than  show.  It like let's actually get deals done and let's alleviate some of  the pain from the steel and aluminum tariffs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's doing it.  I mean, Stuart just said the Mexicans are  in the White House today and we keep hearing HHS secretary that we speak  with, Stuart, that they feel really good about a deal with Mexico over the  near-term, and they assume that Canada is going to get in line as well once  the Mexico deal is done.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, that's the way it looks.  The incoming -- the new President of  Mexico has -- his top trade advisor has publicly said, they want to wrap up  a deal, a bilateral deal with United States in a matter of months.  Now,  that's a big deal.  If that happens, well, the Canadians, they're going to  have to come on board somehow or other.  I think it's progress all around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wilbur Ross was on the show earlier, he said, look, Mexico is a  lot more complicated than Canada, and we know that, because Mexico, you  know, there are different deals in terms of workers, where car will  originate in terms of production.  So -- but he, too, was pretty optimistic  about a deal with Mexico.  Stuart, I know you're going to have a lot more  in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you got it.  Sure thing.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart in just 10 minutes' time.  But first, there's  this, Paul Ryan goes from House Speaker to standup comedian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Paul Ryan  could be a live action Disney villain. #WidowsPeak\"  They used to call me  Eddie Munster so it's not too much of a stretch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of the tweets, coming up.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Investigators are now focused on digital  information in the search for a missing college student in Iowa.  Cheryl  Casone with the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  Well, using search warrants, authorities are analyzing 20-year- old, Mollie Tibbett's digit info, that includes her Fitbit which she always  wore, her Instagram and her Snapchat data to track her whereabouts and at  least put a timeline together of her whereabouts the night that she  disappeared while out on a run.  She was last seen jogging in her hometown  of Brooklyn, Iowa about a week ago.  All the information is a key piece of  the investigation, it is not being made public, at this time, but they are  getting data off of her devices.</p><p>All right.  Well, check out this incredible video, dozens of people forming  a human chain to save swimmers from a riptide.  You can see them locking  arms up the coast of Emerald Isle, this is in North Carolina, by the way.   Emergency crews also got involved in some of these rescues.  Sadly, they  were unable to revive a 41-year-old man after they pulled him out of the  water.  The water looks, to me, it's terrifying.  Swimmers a lot of times  did not heed the beach safety warnings, so that's kind of what happened  there.</p><p>All right, Tommy Hilfiger is offering rewards to customers who wear its new  line of smart clothing that comes with a smart chip tracking how often  customers wear it.  So you earn points that can be used to buy concert  tickets or merchandise.  The brand hopes that interest in the new line is  going to create a microcommunity of brand ambassadors.  </p><p>And then, there is this, this is fun, House Speaker Paul Ryan posted a  video reading mean tweets about himself, taking inspiration from the  popular Jimmy Kimmel segment.  Watch!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RYAN:  Paul Ryan could be live action Disney villain.  #WidowsPeak.   Woodchucks eating Paul Ryan's car has given me hope for the future.  My car  dealer as well.  I want to high-five Paul Ryan's face with a shovel, just  hard enough to make him see birdies.  Take that smug look.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE:  There's the look.  With Ryan not seeking re-election in November,  maybe some of these critics are going to ease up on him.  At least he  proved he can take a serious joke or tell one, if you want to put it that  way, Maria.  It's really funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is very funny.  Maybe he's just taking it all in stride  now that he knows he's on his way out.</p><p>CASONE:  Why not?  Relax about it, all right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a break.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you much every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right back at you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Smart, hard-working lady.  The best in the business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  Have a great day.  Go seize  that day.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day.  Yes, indeed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  Let's get right  at it.  This stuff is very important for everyone.  Facebook slowing down,  and that spells real trouble for the company and its investors.

Some of the numbers have been eye-popping: JPMorgan Chase, for example,will invest $1.4 billionthis year on new mobile banking features, blockchain-related upgrades to the back office and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But these big capital outlays are rarely well received by the investment community. Consider the recent case of WSFS Financial in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>When the $7.1 billion-asset company announced on Aug. 8 its agreement to buy Beneficial Bancorp in Philadelphia, WSFS said it woulduse cost savings from the deal to invest more than $30 million toupgrade the digital consumer banking experience, its data platform, risk management and workflow automation.</p><p>The price tag is sizable for WSFS - it is virtually equal to its second-quarter profit of $28.7 million.</p><p>The market's reaction? WSFS' stock has fallen 11% to $49.35 per share since the deal announcement - a sharper nosedive than normal for a buyer in an M&amp;A deal.</p><p>Investors are very skeptical about promises that big technology investments will pay off, and that is undoubtedly the reason for the extra stock drop-off in this case, said Joe Gladue, an analyst at Merion Capital Group.</p><p>\"It's unclear whether tech upgrades really do produce cost savings long term,\" Gladue said. \"Are you just going to have to keep spending on tech, since technology is always changing?\"</p><p>Investors aren't sold that tech investments are worth the huge expense, said Frank Schiraldi, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>\"What investors have a tough time with is that the benefit is more intangible\" than other large investments that banks can make, such as hiring sales teams away from other banks, Schiraldi said.</p><p>\"It's harder to see a clear earn-back\" with technology investments, Schiraldi said. He noted that WSFS has actually been a leader among banks in making cost-effective tech investments.</p><p>WSFS made the decision to use savings from the Beneficial deal to invest in technology because \"advances and changing customer preferences are rapidly disrupting the traditional banking model,\" said Jimmy Hernandez, a spokesman for WSFS.</p><p>\"Bank management, investors and analysts are aligned about the need for technology investments,\" Hernandez said.</p><p>Constant spending to improve technology has become a fundamental cost of doing business, whether the investor community likes it or not, said Brian Johnson, CEO of the $1.3 billion-asset Choice Financial Group in Fargo, N.D.</p><p>\"Especially in terms of anti-money-laundering compliance, a lot of technology goes into that,\" Johnson said. \"You've got to invest in the back office, but the consumer expects technology upgrades as well.\"</p><p>Many equity analysts remain unconvinced that huge tech investments are worth the costs. But that view is simply the nature of investors who focus on a bank's stock, rather than its long-term performance, said Scott Durant, an analyst at Kroll Bond Rating Agency.</p><p>\"Equity markets tend to have a shorter-term focus than bank management teams,\" Durant said. \"You can't cut your way to profitability long-term. Technology like interactive teller machines will enhance earnings power long-term.\"</p><p>Since Choice Financial is privately held, Johnson said he doesn't feel the same resistance to making tech investments as the heads of publicly traded banks. But that doesn't mean Choice can spend unlimited amounts on technology. Since the bank's customers are located in a large territory, its branches serve fewer customers than banks that operate in dense, urban markets.</p><p>\"We explored the use of video tellers,\" Johnson said. \"But we have so many locations spread out in rural areas, it's difficult to make that pencil out.\"</p><p>Thus, Choice Financial opted not to upgrade to video tellers, even though the bank's customers wanted the service.</p><p>And that's the rub for many banks. Tech investments aren't always made to cut costs, Gladue said. Sometimes they're needed to just to remain competitive.</p><p>\"You've got to keep pace with your rivals,\" Gladue said. \"Even if it doesn't produce cost savings, it's still a necessary expense for survival.\"</p><p>What makes investors the most irritated is when banks invest in technology they don't need, or spend too much, said Jared Shaw, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.</p><p>\"You need to break down your technology spending into what you want to have and what you need to have,\" Shaw said.</p><p>Some banks that have been required by regulators to upgrade Bank Secrecy Act compliance systems, such asInvestors Bancorpin Short Hills, N.J., andEast West Bancorpin Los Angeles, have had no choice but to spend on tech investments, Shaw said.</p><p>\"It wasn't really an option\" for those banks, he said.</p><p>Often it makes more sense for smaller banks to adopt software that their core processors offer, Shaw said. There's no need for a smaller bank to create its own proprietary system when a prepackaged system would work just as well.</p><p>\"Investors don't like it when you are talking about spending significantly beyond the table stakes of the industry and you're trying to become more of a fintech than a bank,\" he said.</p><p>If bankers get frustrated by equity analysts second-guessing their decisions on technology, a debt analyst points out that bond rating agencies tend to take a longer view of costly investments. That might help executives sell an expensive technology outlay to skeptical board members, said Lisa Kwasnowski, an analyst at DBRS.</p><p>\"Bond investors tend to have more patience, knowing that the investment technology is critical to being competitively positioned in the future,\" Kwasnowski said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000165-6ced-d901-af7d-6fff02810000-165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3W-SS31-F06X-W0XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"960\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia, Inc.

Some of the numbers have been eye-popping: JPMorgan Chase, for example,will invest $1.4 billionthis year on new mobile banking features, blockchain-related upgrades to the back office and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But these big capital outlays are rarely well received by the investment community. Consider the recent case of WSFS Financial in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>When the $7.1 billion-asset company announced on Aug. 8 its agreement to buy Beneficial Bancorp in Philadelphia, WSFS said it woulduse cost savings from the deal to invest more than $30 million toupgrade the digital consumer banking experience, its data platform, risk management and workflow automation.</p><p>The price tag is sizable for WSFS - it is virtually equal to its second-quarter profit of $28.7 million.</p><p>The market's reaction? WSFS' stock has fallen 11% to $49.35 per share since the deal announcement - a sharper nosedive than normal for a buyer in an M&amp;A deal.</p><p>Investors are very skeptical about promises that big technology investments will pay off, and that is undoubtedly the reason for the extra stock drop-off in this case, said Joe Gladue, an analyst at Merion Capital Group.</p><p>\"It's unclear whether tech upgrades really do produce cost savings long term,\" Gladue said. \"Are you just going to have to keep spending on tech, since technology is always changing?\"</p><p>Investors aren't sold that tech investments are worth the huge expense, said Frank Schiraldi, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.</p><p>\"What investors have a tough time with is that the benefit is more intangible\" than other large investments that banks can make, such as hiring sales teams away from other banks, Schiraldi said.</p><p>\"It's harder to see a clear earn-back\" with technology investments, Schiraldi said. He noted that WSFS has actually been a leader among banks in making cost-effective tech investments.</p><p>WSFS made the decision to use savings from the Beneficial deal to invest in technology because \"advances and changing customer preferences are rapidly disrupting the traditional banking model,\" said Jimmy Hernandez, a spokesman for WSFS.</p><p>\"Bank management, investors and analysts are aligned about the need for technology investments,\" Hernandez said.</p><p>Constant spending to improve technology has become a fundamental cost of doing business, whether the investor community likes it or not, said Brian Johnson, CEO of the $1.3 billion-asset Choice Financial Group in Fargo, N.D.</p><p>\"Especially in terms of anti-money-laundering compliance, a lot of technology goes into that,\" Johnson said. \"You've got to invest in the back office, but the consumer expects technology upgrades as well.\"</p><p>Many equity analysts remain unconvinced that huge tech investments are worth the costs.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Niall Ferguson via The Spectator,[3]  Social media helped Donald Trump take the White House. Silicon Valley won't let it happen again        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/10/12/20171013_trumpfb.jpg\">http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/10/12/20171013_trumpfb.jpg</url>  In the 1962 Japanese sci-fi classic King Kong vs Godzilla, the two giant monsters fight to a stalemate atop Mount Fuji. I have been wondering for some time when the two giants of American social media would square up for what promises to be a comparably brutal battle. </p><p>Finally, it began last month - and where else but on Twitter?  'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' tweeted the President of the United States on 27 September.  Mark Zuckerberg shot back hours later (on Facebook, of course): 'Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don't like. That's what running a platform for all ideas looks like.'  A platform for all ideas? Well, maybe. Others see Facebook differently. As Zuckerberg's response to Trump acknowledged, the President is not alone in criticising him. The various inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election are turning up much that is awkward, notably that Russia bought around 3,000 Facebook ads designed to spread politically divisive posts to Americans before and after the election, as well as to promote inflammatory political protests on issues such as Muslim immigration.  It may be too big a stretch to claim that Russian Facebook ads swung the election in Trump's favour. But it seems plausible that his campaign's use of social media, particularly Facebook, gave it a vital edge that compensated for its financial disadvantage relative to Hillary Clinton's campaign. On that, if on nothing else, I suspect Steve Bannon and Clinton would agree. 'Facebook is now the largest news platform in the world,' Clinton writes in her election postmortem. 'With that awesome power comes great responsibility.'  Awesome power, yes. At the end of June, the number of active Facebook users (people who visit the site at least once a month) passed the two billion mark. WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram \u2014 all owned by Facebook \u2014 have three billion users altogether, though no doubt there is much overlap. Two- thirds of American adults are on Facebook and 45 per cent get their news from it. More than half the UK population access Facebook at least once a month. The average user is on the site for 1/16 of every day.  But great responsibility? In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Facebook briefly featured a bogus story that the shooter had 'Trump-hating' views. A fake page claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the far-left Antifa movement, saying the goal had been to kill 'Trump-supporting fascist dogs'.  Last month, the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica revealed that Facebook's online ad tools had helped advertisers to target self-described 'Jew haters' or people who had used phrases such as 'how to burn Jews'. In the words of Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg: 'The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.' Facebook 'never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way'.  What Facebook intended and how Facebook is used turn out to be very different. The company's motto used to be: 'Make the world more open and connected.' It's no longer quite so simple.  'For most of the existence of the company, this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,' Zuckerberg recently said. 'Something changed.'  What has changed is that the world has belatedly woken up to realities about social networks that were already obvious to anyone familiar with history and network science.  For most of history, it is true, hierarchies have tended to dominate distributed networks. However, there are historical precedents for technological change leading to enhanced connectedness that empowers social networks and weakens hierarchies.  The first began exactly 500 years ago, when Martin Luther launched his campaign for reform of the Roman Catholic church. Had it not been for the printing press, Luther would have been just another obscure heretic and might well have ended his life in the flames of the stake. But Gutenberg's innovation enabled Luther's message to 'go viral' \u2014 as we would now say \u2014 and it spread with remarkable speed throughout Germany and then across north-western Europe.  Luther was as much of a utopian as the pioneers of Silicon Valley in our own time. In his mind, the Reformation would create a powerful new network of pious Christians, all enabled to read the Bible in the vernacular and to establish more direct relationships with God than the indirect ones mediated by a corrupt ecclesiastical hierarchy. The vision of St Peter of a 'priesthood of all believers' would finally be realised.  But the true upshot of the Reformation was not harmony but polarisation and conflict. Not everyone was inspired by Luther's message. Some sought to go further than him. Others reacted violently against the proposed reforms. The Counter-Reformation adopted the Protestants' novel techniques of propagation and deployed them against the heretics.  Yet it proved impossible to destroy Protestant networks, even with mass executions and hideously cruel torture. If anything, persecution promoted radicalisation. Meanwhile, the constantly growing network of printed words proved itself as ready to spread madness as holiness. The witch craze of the 17th century was a classic example of a monster meme, claiming innocent lives from Scotland to Salem, Massachusetts.  There are three big differences between now and then.  First, today's social networks are vastly bigger, faster and more widespread than those of the early modern era.  Secondly, whereas the printing press was a truly decentralised technology \u2014 Johannes Gutenberg was no Bill Gates \u2014 the ownership of today's IT infrastructure is concentrated in remarkably few hands.  Finally, our networked age began by disrupting markets and later politics; only one religion, Islam, has been significantly affected.  But the similarities are nevertheless striking. Now, as then, newly empowered networks have led to polarisation, not harmony. Now, as then, the networks have acted as a transmission mechanism for all kinds of manias and panics as well as truth and beauty. And now, as then, the networks have eroded territorial sovereignty, weakening the established structures of political authority.  The US government sought to harness the power of social networks when the National Security Agency co-opted the big technology companies into its PRISM programme of mass domestic and foreign surveillance. But the new networks did not easily integrate into old power structures. Globally disseminated leaks, courtesy of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, exposed PRISM, while a new kind of populist politics flourished on social media.  A defining feature of social networks (as in the Reformation) is their tendency to divide rather than unite. Recent research on American blogs and Twitter reveals a similar pattern: the emergence of two self-segregated ideological communities, one liberal, the other conservative. Just as birds of a feather flock together (network geeks call it 'homophily') so Twitter users retweet within their political clusters. One study found that with tweets on hot-button political topics (such as gun control, same-sex marriage and climate change), the use of emotional words increases their diffusion by a factor of 20 per cent for each additional word. Ever wondered why tweets are full of expletives? Now you know.  The presidential election of 2016 was a tale of many networks. By going viral through a largely self-organised network, Trump beat Clinton's old-school, hierarchically structured campaign, which poured money into antiquated channels like local television. Isis contributed to the febrile atmosphere with its worst attack in North America (in Orlando in June last year), prompting Trump's populist (and popular) promise of a 'Muslim ban'. But the Trump network had itself been penetrated by the Russian intelligence network. Trump's campaign and, to a much smaller extent, the Russians both used Facebook and Twitter as tools to discredit his opponent and discourage potential Democratic voters.  Make no mistake: 2016 will never happen again. Silicon Valley hates Trump for too many reasons to count. The most important are his stance on immigration (on which the Valley depends for its supply of skilled software engineers) and Big Tech's need to 'virtue-signal' to its most valued user demographic: the young and affluent. They lean left. So does the otherwise capitalist Valley.  The political consequences were not immediately obvious, unless you were paying close attention, but after the Charlottesville clashes between white supremacists, neo-Nazis and their various left-wing opponents, they were there for all to see. Matthew Prince, CEO of the internet service provider Cloudflare, described what happened: 'Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the internet.' On the basis that 'the people behind the Daily Stormer are assholes', he denied their fascistic website access to the worldwide web. As Prince himself rightly observed: 'No one should have that power. We need to have a discussion around this with clear rules and clear frameworks. My whims and those of Jeff [Bezos] and Larry [Page] and Satya [Nadella] and Mark [Zuckerberg] shouldn't be what determines what should be online.' Yet that discussion has barely begun. And until it happens, it will indeed be they who decide who is allowed on the internet.  This goes to the heart of the matter. According to Zuckerberg, Facebook is 'a tech company, not a media company We build the tools; we do not produce any content'. Yet in practice, according to a recent Reuters investigation, 'an elite group of at least five senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls.' In the words of Espen Egil Hansen, the editor-in-chief of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, Zuckerberg is now 'the world's most powerful editor'.  It is not only neo-Nazi sites that find themselves on the online equivalent of the newsroom spike. Twitter has recently rejected paid-for tweets from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) on the grounds of 'Hate'. These tweets were hardly excerpts from Mein Kampf: for example: 'The fiscal cost created by illegal immigrants of $746.3bn compares to a total cost of deportation of $124.1bn.' In the words of CIS director Mark Krikorian, 'The internet is now a utility more important than phones or cable TV. If people can be denied access to it based on the content of their ideas and speech (rather than specific illegal acts), why not make phone service contingent on your political views? Or mail delivery?'  Google recently revealed that it is using machine learning to document 'hate crimes and events' in America. Among their partners in this effort is the notorious Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which maintains a list of 'anti-Muslim extremists' \u2014 including my wife, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and the British liberal Muslim Maajid Nawaz \u2014 but no list whatsoever of Muslim extremists.  'YouTube doesn't allow hate speech or content that promotes or incites violence,' declared a recent message to YouTube content creators. But who decides what is 'hate speech'? The phrase has become the 21st-century equivalent of 'heresy'. It's what you call something before you proscribe it.  Silicon Valley insists it is home to neutral network platforms. This is no longer credible. Facebook alone has, without quite meaning to, evolved into the most powerful publisher in the history of the world. Zuckerberg is William Randolph Hearst to the power of ten.  So what to do? Left-leaning Democrats have an answer: revive the progressive interpretation of anti-trust policy and break up the internet monopolies. Superficially, they have a case. Amazon controls 65 per cent of all online new book sales. Google's market share of online search is 87 per cent in the US. In mobile social networking, Facebook and its subsidiaries control 75 per cent of the American market.  Yet who seriously cares what the hipster anti-trust types say? Silicon Valley is a huge donor to the Democrats. Why would they make life difficult for Big Tech when it so openly leans left? The real question is when Republicans (and not just the President) are going to wake up to the threat they now face.  Two big battles are looming: one on the question of net neutrality (the principle that all bits of data should be treated alike, regardless of their content or value), the other on the 1996 Communications and Decency Act, which allows tech firms exemption from liability for content that appears on their platforms. A group of senators led by Rob Portman has started the ball rolling by seeking to impose liability on companies that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking on their platforms. The initial response of the Internet Association, a trade group that is essentially a mouthpiece for the Valley, was revealing: 'The entire internet industry wants to end human trafficking,' it said. 'But there are ways to do this without amending a law foundational to legitimate internet services.' Last month, however, the IA conceded the need for 'targeted amendments'.  This battle is only just beginning, but its outcome could be decisive in both the 2018 midterm elections to Congress and the 2020 presidential race. The regulatory status quo is not only highly favourable to Silicon Valley. It could also prove highly unfavourable to Republican candidates \u2014 though (so far as I could tell on a recent visit to Washington) the penny has not yet dropped with lawmakers who are accustomed to talking only about deregulation, not regulation.  In many ways, what we are about to witness will be a classic struggle between new networks and established hierarchies. Like King Kong's epic slugfest with Godzilla, however, it's far from easy to predict which side will prevail - or how much collateral damage they will both inflict on American democracy. In the old Godzilla movies, after all, the one predictable thing is that Tokyo always gets destroyed.

But the company's latest moves into entertainment services is raising red flags for antitrust experts.</p><p>\"I would caution that enforcers need to be very vigilant to make sure that Apple is not tipping the scales in its favor,\" Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, told The Hill.</p><p>Hubbard said she is concerned that Apple is \"controlling the game and playing the game too\" as the owner of both the iOS App Store and creator of the iPhone.</p><p>The new concerns over Apple are emerging as lawmakers show more interest in reining in big tech, particularly when it comes privacy and competition issues.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a 2020 contender, earlier this month released a plan to break up some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies: Facebook, Google and Amazon. She later told media outlets that she would target Apple as well.</p><p>\"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store,\" Warren said. \"It's got to be one or the other. Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time. So it's the same notion.\"</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, in particular has vowed to use his perch to crack down on tech giants' enormous market power and potential antitrust violations.</p><p>Experts told The Hill they expect Congress and regulators to watch closely to ensure Apple does not prioritize its new subscription services over competitors.</p><p>Chris Sagers, a professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, told The Hill that Apple could run into trouble legally if it tweaks its App Store rules to disadvantage competing services.</p><p>Apple's video streaming service, Apple TV+, will offer original content from celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Anniston and Steven Spielberg, among others. The company has not yet announced how much the service will cost per month, but Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Monday event said it is coming to Apple devices this fall in more than 100 countries.</p><p>It will be offered through Apple TV, which comes preloaded onto Apple products.</p><p>The service puts Apple in competition with both Amazon and Netflix, which currently dominates the streaming market.</p><p>\"Now that Apple is getting into the content creation business, there are some real questions about how it can bundle its services and how it might potentially distribute content that can only be used on its platform,\" Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, told The Hill. \"It could raise some antitrust questions.\"</p><p>Court said Apple could quickly become the \"dominant player\" in music and video streaming, potentially driving out competitors and allowing the company to raise prices for consumers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple's news subscription service, Apple News+, will offer customers access to more than 300 magazines, as well as some of the country's largest newspapers, through their Apple News app for $9.99 per month. Some newspapers that require a subscription, including The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, will be available to readers through the subscription bundle.</p><p>\"The question will be, is Apple doing anything to ease its entry that would hurt other people competing in these spaces?\" Sagers said.</p><p>Apple is already dealing with concerns over its market power abroad. Spotify, a music streaming app, earlier this month filed a formal antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union alleging the company is trying to unfairly stifle its competitors through the App Store.</p><p>Spotify in the complaint claimed that Apple is leveraging the App Store to keep competing services such as Spotify at bay, which Apple has denied. Apple offers its own music streaming app through its App Store.</p><p>Apple has tried to distinguish itself from other Silicon Valley titans by touting its robust privacy policies and, as seen at the launch event, its star power.</p><p>At the event, before a parade of celebrities spoke about Apple TV+, Apple executives repeatedly touted the privacy protections in their new subscription services.</p><p>\"Apple doesn't know what you read, Apple doesn't allow advertisers to track you,\" Apple's vice president of applications, Roger Rosnor, said, discussing the news service. \"What you read about in Apple News will not follow you across the web.\"</p><p>The presentation promoting Apple's new credit card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs, promised that Goldman Sachs \"will never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing.\"</p><p>Those efforts have garnered Apple much goodwill, but as the company expands its services it could face the same tough questions as other giants.</p><p>\"Apple has a much less destructive business model than Facebook and Google,\" Hubbard said, noting the business model of those companies requires collecting user data to target ads in a way Apple's does not.</p><p>\"But you still have the same conflict of interest problems.\"</p><p>Apple's new subscription services in gaming, television and news, as well as its new credit card, will be fully rolled out over the next year. How they compete against other established companies remains to be seen.</p><p>But as Apple expands, Congress and regulators will likely be watching closely.</p><p>\"I thought the platform in the most trouble was Amazon or maybe Facebook, but it's starting to look like it could be Apple,\" Sagers said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

ACCC boss says.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York: </emphasis>Governments around the world will hit Facebook and Google with increasingly onerous restrictions unless the tech giants drop their \"outrageous\" insistence they are neutral distributors of information, according to Australia's competition tsar Rod Sims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) boss also warned there was a risk of next year's US presidential election being undermined by the same flood of \"fake news\" that marred the 2016 campaign unless Facebook lifts its game.</p><p>\"Google and Facebook are very different businesses but the thing that strikes me is how little responsibility they take for their platforms,\" Sims told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in an interview in New York, where he is attending a meeting of the world's top competition regulators.</p><p>\"They say, ???We're just technology platforms so don't blame us.'</p><p>\"I think that's outrageous.\"</p><p>Sims said: \"They not only created these platforms but they are actively influencing them through their algorithms and making a huge amount of money out of it.</p><p>\"The longer they take the view that they are just a ???dumb pipe', the more intrusive governments and regulators are going to be.</p><p>\"The pressure for change is coming.\"</p><p>Sims said policymakers in the US and beyond had studied the ACCC's landmark digital platforms report, released in July, and had sought advice about whether the policy ideas could be introduced in their countries.</p><p>The Morrison government has backed the ACCC report which made 23 recommendations to protect consumers, encourage competition and address challenges facing traditional media outlets.</p><p>Sims said governments and regulators around the world are increasingly seized by the need to protect social media users' privacy, encourage competition and prevent the spread of online misinformation.</p><p>\"This used to be a debate of America versus Europe and that's not there anymore,\" Sims said</p><p>\"We have the whole world moving as one now.</p><p>\"We are going to solve this and a year ago I wouldn't have been confident of that.\"</p><p>Sims had an hour-long phone conversation this week with the attorneys-general of Texas and Nebraska, who are leading an investigation into Google's \"potential monopolistic behaviour\" that is backed by all US state governments.</p><p>\"It's amazing to get 50 states to agree on anything, and it shows the momentum is there,\" Sims said.</p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have also launched a major investigation into whether Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon are abusing their market power.</p><p>If anything, Sims said the American debate about tech regulation, until recently dominated by those opposed to government intervention, was swinging too far in the other direction.</p><p>Leading Democratic presidential candidates including Elizabeth Warren have called for the US government to break up Facebook and other tech giants, an idea Sims says is \"distracting\" and \"simplistic\".</p><p>\"It may eventually be concluded that breaking them up is the best thing to do but we're not there yet,\" he said.</p><p>\"I am evangelical about the idea that you can't solve all these problems through competition law alone.\"</p><p>The lobby group representing Facebook, Google and Twitter on Friday said the ACCC's proposed rules to stop the spread of fake news were \"disappointing\" and could leave websites and regulators acting as gatekeepers of truth.</p><p>The ACCC has recommended that digital platforms with 1 million or more monthly active users sign up to a new code of conduct, including rules about how they handle disinformation.</p><p>A spokesman for Facebook said the company was working on the issue \"day and night\".</p><p>\"Our teams continue to develop smarter tools, greater transparency, and stronger partnership to help us fight misinformation and prevent election interference,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>A Google spokeswoman declined to comment directly on Sims' comments but said the search platform had \"taken a number of steps to curb misinformation in our products\".</p><p>\"We know our work here isn't done, and we'll continue to evaluate our efforts to help improve our products,\" she said in a statement.</p><p>with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jennifer

In a tweet, Musk said, \"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week.\" It is anyone's guess what the new masterplan could be all about-the next evolution of autonomous cars, the Hyperloop high-speed transportation system or something completely new. Back in 2006, Musk had written a blog post titled \"The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\", and that gave the world a first glimpse at what later became the Tesla Model S four-door family car and the Tesla 3 sports sedan. We will stay tuned for this one.</p><p>Autonomous cars being investigated</p><p>The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is launching an investigation into the fatal Tesla Model S crash of 7 May, which has introduced fresh doubts about the safety of autonomous cars. The investigation will attempt to identify any basic problems with the concept of autonomous cars and whether the current set of regulations are robust enough to cover the emerging technology.</p><p>Google's post-quantum encryption</p><p>While quantum computers are still in the experimental phase at present, software giant Googleis already preparing for the worst-quantum computer generated hacking attacks. Called post-quantum cryptography, the test phase includes rolling this out to a small number of connections between the Chrome and Google's servers and the encryption key is being tested alongside the present security protocols. Matt Braithwaite, software engineer, Google, said in a blog post, \"The post-quantum algorithm might turn out to be breakable even with today's computers, in which case the elliptic-curve algorithm will still provide the best security that today's technology can offer. Alternatively, if the post-quantum algorithm turns out to be secure then it'll protect the connection even against a future, quantum computer.\"</p><p>Pokemon Go stalled, for the time being</p><p>The addictive Pokemon Go augmented reality-based game, which is a spin-off from the popular Nintendo game from the yesteryears, has been a rage in the US for the past few days, which has led to societal problems such as people crashing cars while driving far too immersed in the search for a Pokemon and someone finding a dead body while chasing a Pokemon in the game. It was expected that the game will be released globally over the next few days, but there seems to be a hitch. Game developer Niantic has said that the roll-out will resume while they \"fix server issues\". There are reports that Pokemon Go players in the US are already suffering through delays and lags, due to load on game servers.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from MINT.

In a memo to Apple's 120,000 employees on August 3, two days later, chief executive Tim Cook praised the company, but urged staff that such financial metrics were \"not the most important measure of our success\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Just as Steve always did in moments like this,\" Mr Cook wrote, drawing on the legacy of his predecessor Steve Jobs.\u00a0\"We should all look forward to Apple's bright future.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for investors, that bright future may be a little more distant for Apple and the four other tech stocks which\u00a0comprise\u00a0the so-called \"FAANGs\":\u00a0Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.</p><p>For years, their stellar performance has served as\u00a0rocket fuel for the wider US market, helping drive a bull run in stocks that has reverberated around the globe.</p><p>Yesterday however, all\u00a0five officially\u00a0entered bear market territory, meaning they have all dropped 20pc from their highest points. Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, are down 20pc, Amazon is down 25pc, Netflix 35pc and Facebook 39pc. Put together,\u00a0more than $1tn has been wiped from\u00a0their valuations since\u00a0they touched\u00a052-week highs only a few weeks ago.</p><p>The market slump\u00a0has taken a chunk out of other tech stocks, from chip makers to software providers, as concerns mount over trade tensions between the\u00a0US and China\u00a0and a\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">slowdown\u00a0in Asia h</url> as rippled through the industry.</p><p>While their\u00a0share prices have been grabbing the headlines, the giants of Silicon Valley\u00a0are facing a variety of different challenges.</p><p>Shareholders are now pondering the\u00a0extent\u00a0to which\u00a0these tech stocks are the victims of an inevitable correction after\u00a0a dizzying rise in their valuations over\u00a0recent months, and to what degree\u00a0is their\u00a0fundamental value suffering?</p><p>                   Saturation                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">Peak iPhone</url> ?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">Peak Facebook</url> ? One concern that has been plaguing some of the Big Tech names is that they are running out of momentum in key markets as rates of growth\u00a0start to slow. The Facebook app's market penetration in the US was shown to be wobbling at the start of 2018, when Daily Active Users fell for the first time to 184 million.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, has run into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">problems that are affecting all smartphone sellers</url> . The simple truth is that almost everyone who is likely to buy an iPhone already owns one. Apple has not returned to the peaks of iPhone sales it made in 2015, despite reporting record profits. While Apple's market cap hit $1tn in August, and for a while continued to climb, it has since dropped\u00a0to around $882bn.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">Tech wreck Big Tech shares have lost $1tn in value this year</url></p><p>Not everyone is downcast\u00a0on the opportunities for growth. \"Even though we have seen some saturation on the main Facebook platform, Facebook is still seen as having a stranglehold,\" says Bill Fisher, an analyst at eMarketer. \"The\u00a0parent company has Instagram, which is seen as the new Facebook.\u00a0It has been hedging its bets, it has been spreading itself around.\"</p><p>Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, is similarly confident on Apple's return to form. \"Apple are making gravity defying margins on the phones that they selling\" despite the slowdown in smartphone demand, he says. Others believe this is a strategy that may not work forever as consumers grow tired of shelling out such high sums for products which are no longer a novelty.\u00a0</p><p>                   Regulation\u00a0and reputation                   </p><p>Potentially the biggest\u00a0one-day falls in the stock price of the big tech companies\u00a0in recent weeks have stemmed from\u00a0damage to the reputation of specific companies. Facebook, above all,\u00a0has been dented by simmering\u00a0scandals over privacy, misinformation and the way\u00a0management has handled them. A string of key departures from some of its core businesses, including\u00a0the founders of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">Instagram</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">WhatsApp</url>, have not helped.</p><p>\"Facebook is down for a lot of reasons,\" says Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, a senior Wall Street digital economy expert. \"Concerns are mounting on how well the is company run and about management changes\".</p><p>The threat of further regulation to bring tech companies to heel has not abated. In the US, some states have begun implementing their own data privacy bills to mirror Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. There have also been mounting calls to break the choke hold of some of tech's monopolies - not least Facebook's domination of social media and Amazon's increasingly all-encompassing retail empire.</p><p>Rivals have also been hitting back. Netflix, which has largely been unaffected by reputational tarring that has hit Facebook, is facing growing pressure from a host of rivals - including a new streaming effort from Disney.</p><p>                   Digital ad market                   </p><p>Despite the the gloomy outlook of the past week, the digital advertising market, a core driver of Facebook, Google and increasingly Amazon's income, appears to show no signs of slowing. The latest figures from the\u00a0Interactive Advertising Bureau, a US trade body, suggested ad income grew\u00a023pc in the first half of the year.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">At a glance | FAANG stocks</url></p><p>Such figures should be cause for celebration for tech investors, but more conservative analysts have said the big picture is not as rosy. In a note to clients, Wieser said the long run for the ad market will almost certainly be hit by a slow down. \"Every passing period... means we get closer to the point in time where growth for digital media owners approaches the level we would expect to see for the overall advertising industry,\" he said.</p><p>                   The Trump effect                   </p><p>While the US/China trade war tensions may not openly impact Facebook and Google, both have been hoping to find ways to break into the Chinese market for some time now as an avenue to future growth. With the ante upped from US president Donald Trump, that possibility seems slimmer than ever. Hardware-maker Apple is likely to have felt the trade tensions most seriously, given a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">large number of its suppliers for the iPhone are based in China</url> .\u00a0</p><p>It may also be that shareholders are seeing the end of the big share buybacks that were enabled by President Trump's tax relief for big US companies to bring their cash piles home from overseas.</p><p>                   Red October becomes Red November                   </p><p>The last six weeks have hit global stocks, not just tech, with big falls across <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/recipe-trillion-dollar-company-apple-hit-jackpot/\">markets, oil indexes and asset classes</url> .</p><p>And tech stocks are just the worst hit because they have been the most overvalued, some analysts argue.\u00a0\"The large tech companies (the so-called FAANGs) have been looking frothy for a while,\" says TS Lomard analyst Dario Perkins, \"which makes their recent selloff rather unsurprising.\"</p><p>Etoro analyst Mati Greenspan concurs: \"In the tech sector we are seeing shares that are trading 100 times there earnings.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Madrid, 28 may (EFE).- El desarrollo de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas o \"big tech\", como Google, Amazon, Facebook o Apple, puede acabar transformando el sector de la banca de manera radical, estimulando la competencia a corto plazo, pero tambi\u00e9n aumentando la inestabilidad financiera e impulsando una concentraci\u00f3n a\u00fan mayor.\u00c9sta son las principales conclusiones de un art\u00edculo publicado en la revista de Estabilidad Financiera del Banco de Espa\u00f1a y en el que se analizan las implicaciones del desarrollo de las \"big tech\" para los bancos tradicionales y la competencia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Su autor, Jorge Padilla, argumenta que la entrada de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas en la actividad bancaria, sin que est\u00e9n sometidas a las mismas exigencias que los bancos, implica mayores riesgos para la estabilidad financiera, por eso propone, en primer lugar, \"nivelar el campo de juego\" y eliminar \"la brecha regulatoria\". </p><p>Se trata de la misma tesis defendida en repetidas ocasiones por los grandes banqueros, como la presidenta del Banco Santander, Ana Bot\u00edn, que ha insistido en la necesidad de que se apliquen las mismas reglas si se prestan id\u00e9nticos servicios, con independencia de que los ofrezcan bancos o nuevos competidores. </p><p>El hecho de que por el momento las exigencias regulatorias a las \"big tech\" sean menores distorsiona la competencia. </p><p>Si se acaba con esta diferencia puede ser un \u00e9xito desde el punto de vista de la estabilidad financiera, reconoce, aunque quiz\u00e1 evita que las \"big tech\" puedan competir \"cara a cara\" con los bancos tradicionales y ve muy complicado que esta medida se implemente. </p><p>LA CRISIS DEL CORONAVIRUS </p><p>La digitalizaci\u00f3n financiera est\u00e1 avanzando en esta crisis y las empresas \"big tech\" est\u00e1n jugando un papel \"crucial\" en un momento en el que muchos consumidores compran en internet y mucha gente trabaja desde casa, lo que est\u00e1 aumentando la participaci\u00f3n de estas compa\u00f1\u00edas en el sistema de pago. </p><p>Tanto es as\u00ed que, considera, puede hacer que estas compa\u00f1\u00edas tengan un papel m\u00e1s importante en la financiaci\u00f3n de hogares y pymes, acelerando la posibilidad de que tras la crisis de la COVID-19 aparezcan riesgos para la estabilidad financiera. </p><p>Por ello, aboga por que tanto legisladores como supervisores reaccionen r\u00e1pidamente para frenar los riesgos que plantea la irrupci\u00f3n de los \"bancos big tech\". </p><p>FINTECH </p><p>La revista de Estabilidad Financiera recoge tambi\u00e9n art\u00edculos de otros autores, entre ellos uno en el que participa el profesor Santiago Carb\u00f3, sobre las \"fintech\", empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas de menor tama\u00f1o que innova en materia financiera. </p><p>En comparaci\u00f3n con pa\u00edses semejantes, Espa\u00f1a tiene una elevada proporci\u00f3n de fintech, cinco por cada mill\u00f3n de habitantes, pero unos niveles de inversi\u00f3n y de cr\u00e9dito relativamente bajos, de unos 3,4 euros per c\u00e1pita. </p><p>La mayor\u00eda de estas empresas se centran en soluciones de negocio, generan sus ingresos a trav\u00e9s de comisiones y fueron fundadas por emprendedores en grandes ciudades, como Madrid y Barcelona. </p><p>La inversi\u00f3n ha aumentado principalmente por la mayor aportaci\u00f3n del capital riesgo a empresas con rentabilidades muy bajas. </p><p>Otro de los art\u00edculos tambi\u00e9n profundiza sobre el mundo de las fintech y recuerda que en Espa\u00f1a no existe un registro oficial sobre estas entidades. </p><p>Sin embargo, el Banco de Espa\u00f1a trabaja para delimitar este ecosistema a efectos estad\u00edsticos y de seguimiento de la innovaci\u00f3n financiera, identificando los distintos tipos de entidades que lo componen y algunas de sus caracter\u00edsticas b\u00e1sicas. </p><p>Por el momento, concluye, la industria fintech presenta una dimensi\u00f3n muy reducida en comparaci\u00f3n con el conjunto del sector financiero espa\u00f1ol, pero los expertos creen necesario que el supervisor espa\u00f1ol realice un seguimiento continuo de esta actividad y mantenga una estrecha colaboraci\u00f3n con la industria y con otras autoridades financieras relevantes.

Tanto a Apple como a Google j\u00e1 disponibilizaram informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre este tema.    A cria\u00e7\u00e3o deste novo imposto, criado especificamente para tributar a atividade digital, \u00e9 um tema que n\u00e3o tem gerado apre\u00e7o junto da administra\u00e7\u00e3o norte-americana, pa\u00eds de origem das chamadas big tech \u2013 Amazon, Facebook, Google e Apple. Adotado por pa\u00edses europeus, este imposto obriga as tecnol\u00f3gicas a pagar uma percentagem pelas receitas geradas no pa\u00eds.    Assim, a Apple e a Google est\u00e3o j\u00e1 a emitir avisos sobre algumas mudan\u00e7as em mercados espec\u00edficos da Europa, refletindo o custo desse imposto.    No caso da Apple, o comunicado emitido \u00e9 direcionado aos programadores, numa publica\u00e7\u00e3o onde \u00e9 a anunciada a atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os tendo j\u00e1 em conta os impostos que est\u00e3o a ser adotados em v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses. \u201cQuando os impostos ou as taxas de convers\u00e3o mudam, temos por vezes a necessidade de atualizar os pre\u00e7os da App Store\u201d, explica a Apple em comunicado, onde anuncia tamb\u00e9m novos pre\u00e7os das aplica\u00e7\u00f5es para pa\u00edses como Chile, M\u00e9xico, Ar\u00e1bia Saudita ou Turquia. \u201cAo longo dos pr\u00f3ximos dias, os pre\u00e7os das aplica\u00e7\u00f5es e das compras feitas nas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es [ in-app purchases ] na App Store ir\u00e1 aumentar para responder \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as de impostos no Chile, M\u00e9xico, Ar\u00e1bia Saudita e Turquia.\u201d No caso da Turquia o um aumento \u00e9 justificado com o novo imposto digital, que implicar\u00e1 uma cobran\u00e7a adicional de 7,5%, al\u00e9m dos impostos j\u00e1 existentes.    Se o consumidor final passar\u00e1 a sentir a altera\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os nos pa\u00edses acima, o mesmo n\u00e3o acontecer\u00e1 noutras opera\u00e7\u00f5es na Europa. \u201cAs receitas tamb\u00e9m ser\u00e3o ajustadas na Alemanha, Fran\u00e7a, It\u00e1lia e Reino Unido e ser\u00e3o calculadas com base no pre\u00e7o exclusivo de imposto\u201d, indica a Apple, refor\u00e7ando que os pre\u00e7os das aplica\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o mudar\u00e3o nas lojas destes pa\u00edses.    No caso da Alemanha, \u00e9 feita uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o na taxa a cobrar aos programadores de aplica\u00e7\u00f5es, passando de 19% para 16%, algo que j\u00e1 est\u00e1 em vigor desde julho. J\u00e1 em Fran\u00e7a e It\u00e1lia os programadores ter\u00e3o de pagar uma taxa adicional de 3%. No Reino Unido a percentagem ser\u00e1 ligeiramente mais baixa, de 2%.    Al\u00e9m da Apple, tamb\u00e9m a Google est\u00e1 a partilhar atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os efeitos dos novos impostos. Numa publica\u00e7\u00e3o para os anunciantes, a gigante da internet anuncia altera\u00e7\u00f5es para mercados espec\u00edficos, como o Reino Unido, \u00c1ustria e Turquia, a partir de 1 de novembro. \u201cOs custos operacionais regulat\u00f3rios ou taxas de impostos digitais poder\u00e3o ser cobradas al\u00e9m dos custos dos an\u00fancios em pa\u00edses espec\u00edficos. Estas novas taxas est\u00e3o associadas aos custos de fazer neg\u00f3cio nesses pa\u00edses\u201d, escreve a Google.    Assim, ser\u00e1 cobrada uma taxa adicional de 2% no Reino Unido e de 5% na \u00c1ustria devido ao imposto digital aplicado nesses pa\u00edses. No caso da Turquia, foi criada uma taxa de 5% devido \u201cao significativo aumento da complexidade e do custo de atuar em conformidade com a atividade regulat\u00f3ria do pa\u00eds\u201d.    Ainda em agosto, a Amazon adotou uma postura semelhante, indicando que passaria a cobrar uma taxa adicional no Reino Unido, tendo j\u00e1 em conta o novo imposto digital.    Esta quarta-feira, o ministro das Finan\u00e7as alem\u00e3o, Olaf Scholz, destacou a necessidade de um acordo internacional sobre o tema dos impostos a cobrar nos servi\u00e7os digitais. Em declara\u00e7\u00f5es no Parlamento Europeu, Scholz afirmou acreditar que a \u201cpress\u00e3o\u201d da crise da pandemia de covid-19 ajudar\u00e1 a que seja finalmente alcan\u00e7ado um acordo a n\u00edvel internacional relativamente a um imposto sobre os servi\u00e7os digitais.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNPT-42989783099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNWBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RT-1F11-F07F-8449-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398829</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Dinheiro Vivo</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Portuguese</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>3 Setembro 2020 Quinta-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Portugal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CYWK</classCode><className>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR169</classCode><className>SOUTHERN EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Rachel Osborne, who joined from Debenhams last month fresh from defeating chief antagonist Mike Ashley in court, has discovered that as much as \u00a325m of its stock <url normalizedValue=\"http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hf9b879c,348a16b4,348a16c0\">may not exist after all</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How serious is a blunder of this size? It's hard to say. The company won't know until an independent investigation led by magic circle law firm Freshfields and independent director Sharon Baylay has been concluded.</p><p>However, that's a lot of misplaced shirts, which doesn't bode well for a chain that has been in disarray since founder and hugger-in-chief Ray Kelvin stepped down in March<url normalizedValue=\"http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hf9b879c,348a16b4,348a16c0\">amid allegations of improper behaviour.</url></p><p>The retailer has unravelled faster than a snagged cardy, and its share price with it, tumbling by more than four fifths in just nine months following a slew of profit warnings. A fall of another 8pc yesterday leaves the shares at a decade low of 364p. The company says that the error relates to \"prior years\" and there will be \"no cash impact\" so an adjustment to historic accounts, rather than current forecasts, is expected, which is somewhat reassuring given October's shocking results.</p><p>The first-half loss, which missed expectations by a cool \u00a320m, was the first since it listed on the Stock Exchange in 1997 and boss Lindsay Page claims current trading is the worst in 30 years.</p><p>Still, as analysts at Peel Hunt point out, glitches of this nature are not unheard off. Often it is nothing more than the result of a simple systems malfunction, and for most companies would be little more than a bump in the road.</p><p>At somewhere like Ted Baker though, it will raise further questions about whether the company has spiralled out of control. There are already concerns about whether a board that includes a chairman and two non-execs, all of whom are seventy-something males, is equipped to fix a brand suspected of losing relevance among its younger customers.</p><p>It is embarrassing for Page, who served as finance director for an incredible 22 years before replacing Kelvin earlier this year. It also casts fresh doubt over the competency of KPMG which has been Ted Baker's auditor for the past 15 years.</p><p>The accountant <url normalizedValue=\"http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hf9b879c,348a16b4,348a16c0\">was hit with a \u00a33m fine last year</url> after admitting misconduct over its work in 2012 and 2013. There is speculation that Kelvin, sitting on more than a third of the stock, may be tempted to return with a cut-price buyout bid. Yet, with every fresh clanger that becomes an even bigger leap of faith.</p><p>                     CMA hard man picks Big Tech fight                   </p><p>Lord Tyrie was expected to flex his muscles as chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, and he hasn't disappointed.</p><p>Having fired an exocet into <url normalizedValue=\"http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hf9b879c,348a16b4,348a16c0\">Sainsbury's planned merger with Asda</url>, the watchdog now looks to be waging war on Big Tech.</p><p>First came the launch of an inquiry into Facebook and Google's possible abuse of dominance in the online advertising market. Then he slapped Amazon with an investigation into its plan to take a small stake in Deliveroo.</p><p>Now, the former select committee hard man has gone looking for a fight with Google in the US with a review into its $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) takeover of cloud computing services provider Looker.</p><p>This looks like Tyrie is drawing a line in the sand, saying that he won't allow the Silicon Valley giants to hoover up any smaller competitors while a full-blown investigation into the structure of digital markets is in the works.</p><p>Facebook and Google control roughly two thirds of Britain's \u00a313bn digital advertising market. <url normalizedValue=\"http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hf9b879c,348a16b4,348a16c0\">The CMA is rightly concerned</url>that the pair can abuse their dominance of customer data to shut-out competition and overcharge advertisers, who then pass the costs onto consumers.</p><p>There is a broader worry too that the cash gusher from the duopoly is used to expand and strengthen their dominance over the entire digital economy by snapping up anything that could challenge Google and Facebook. It's telling that the only company that appears to have any hope of breaking the duopoly is Amazon, an online giant bigger and uglier than either of them.</p><p>Facebook's purchase of Instagram for instance maintained its grip on young people online even as its core product became mostly a forum for grandparents to share family snaps and their views on Brexit.</p><p>Google's swoop on Doubleclick way back in 2007 gave it massive sway over the digital ad chain at a time when regulators were more concerned with local newspaper mergers. Tyrie will not want the CMA to stand by and make those mistakes again.</p><p>It can only be good news for consumers and markets if the tech giants are prevented from getting any bigger.</p><p>But it is a serious blow for any European tech start-ups who had pinned their hopes for a big payday on one of Silicon Valley's beasts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58340336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMY-F3K1-JCJY-G36D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 2, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For the better part of the past year, the Texas senator has raised the alarm about the behavior of those in Silicon Valley, whether it's challenging their legal protections for content on their platforms, anti-competitive conduct, or their alleged anti-conservative bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You know, I am encouraged to see Democrats taking on Big Tech. I think the power of Big Tech and Silicon Valley is deeply troubling,\" Cruz said during an interview with the Washington Examiner in his office in the Russell Senate Office Building. </p><p>\"You know a great illustration is: Elizabeth Warren tried to buy Facebook ads urging that Facebook be broken up under the antitrust laws, and Facebook, in what I think was a colossally foolish move, blocked the ads \u2014 refused to let her run them,\" Cruz said. The incident prompted him to retweet Warren for the first time.</p><p>One of Cruz's biggest complaints against Big Tech is its defense of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives technology companies protections against lawsuits related to content created by users on their platforms. </p><p>During a Senate Commerce Committee hearing this month, Cruz said the provision allows \"Big Tech to act with impunity, to engage in censorship of Americans whose political opinions they don't like and not to face liability for their conduct.\"</p><p>He also criticized the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade, President Trump's replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, because a section in the agreement mirrors Section 230. The clause is \"perceived by many to be a gift to Big Tech,\" Cruz said at the hearing. </p><p>Tech companies argue that the law is what allows them to moderate harmful content such as hate speech and threats on their platforms while also ensuring that the companies don't get unfairly penalized for objectionable user content.</p><p>Cruz spoke about tech regulation in his office, which features Snickers and Skittles from Texas, as well as a copy of Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham, which he once read on the Senate floor during a 21-hour anti-Obamacare talk marathon. Featured prominently is a humongous, colorful painting of President Ronald Reagan giving his \"Tear Down This Wall\" speech in front of the Berlin Wall. </p><p>The Texas Republican has a history of antagonizing the Establishment while backing small government and focusing on decentralization of authority. It plays a role in his skepticism of the growing size of Big Tech companies.</p><p>\"By almost any measure, the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil when it was broken up,\" Cruz said at a hearing on technological censorship in April.</p><p>\"If we have tech companies using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues,\" said Cruz.</p><p>During the April hearing, when Cruz asked Facebook's and Twitter's representatives whether they were neutral platforms, neither of the social media giants would give a yes or no answer.</p><p>Google, Facebook, and Twitter, however, have all emphatically denied any technological anti-conservative bias, saying no evidence shows they systematically favor one political ideology over another on their platforms. Some point to a study by Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society that suggests that, in the current media environment, conservative news and propaganda spread further and faster than news from liberal sources.</p><p>Ultimately, Cruz is convinced that the \"power and censorship of Big Tech is, I think, really dangerous,\" and he says this threat is \"only growing.\"</p><p>\"I don't think we want our democracy controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires,\" he said.</p><p>Photo Caption:Washington Examiner reporter Nihal Krishan interviews Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) the fight he's been looking for against social media platforms. After Twitter this week appended fact checks to Trump's tweets about voting by mail, Trump moved forward with a long-threatened executive order seeking to crack down on legal protections that social media companies such as Twitter enjoy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cruz, though, rests his case against those protections on a very flimsy premise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a series of tweets Friday morning, Cruz argued that companies like Twitter cede these protections when they stop acting as neutral platforms and begin policing content in a biased manner.</p><p>\"Jake, CNN can be sued for defamation,\" Cruz tweeted at CNN's Jake Tapper. \"Why should Twitter be immune?\"</p><p>Several conservatives quickly pointed out the flaw in Cruz's argument. Section 230 - the law Trump sought to recast with his executive order - doesn't make Twitter immune from being sued; it is simply immune from being sued over what its users publish. Just like traditional journalistic companies are immune from being sued over what users publish in their comments sections, Twitter is immune when it comes to comments people post in the form of tweets. If Twitter produces its own content on the platform - like CNN does - that speech is not protected by Section 230.</p><p>When this was pointed out, Cruz suggested that the law required these platforms to be neutral. When they begin banning users or applying fact-checks to users' content, he intimated, they forfeit the protections given to companies that are supposed to be allowing free discourse.</p><p>Cruz told the National Review's Charles C.W. Cooke that Congress provided Section 230 protections because \"they were 'neutral.' Now they censor.\"</p><p>He added later: \"Big Tech used to be neutral, allowing free speech. Now, they shadow ban &amp; decide what to publish.\"</p><p>The problem is that there is basically no indication that Section 230 requires political neutrality. The protection for comments from users on traditional media companies' websites, for instance, also applies to ideologically oriented outlets.</p><p>To back up his claim that the law was intended for neutral platforms, Cruz cited explanatory language in Section 230. It says, \"It is the policy of the United States ... to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.\" It also says that Congress believes that the \"Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.\"</p><p>This is an utterly strange argument from Cruz, a well-credentialed lawyer and former solicitor general of Texas who has argued cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. The text he cites is not laying out requirements; it's merely expressing the sense of the law's authors. Nor does it say anything specifically about the platforms being protected being \"neutral.\"</p><p>What's more, the law's own author has rejected this assertion - in no uncertain terms. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) explained in 2019 to Recode: \"Section 230 is not about neutrality. Period. Full stop. 230 is all about letting private companies make their own decisions to leave up some content and take other content down. You can have a liberal platform; you can have conservative platforms.\"</p><p>He added: \"There's a lot of nonsense out there about what this stuff is all about.\"</p><p>When Wyden made these comments, it bears emphasizing, Cruz had already been barking up this tree. In a 2018 hearing with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, Cruz pressed Zuckerberg on whether he was running a \"neutral public platform\" - apparently trying to pin him down and argue that Section 230 no longer protected Facebook. So you could potentially argue that Wyden was offering some revisionism to fight back against critics of his law.</p><p>But the law itself isn't terribly subtle on this point. It makes clear, in fact, that these platforms have the ability to moderate their content, within some guidelines:</p><p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of -</p><p>(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.</p><p>So when Cruz says, \"Now they censor,\" he's actually referring to something explicitly allowed by the law. This requirement only indicates that the moderation/censorship should be in \"good faith\" - a far different standard than being politically neutral.</p><p>It also allows for the content to be restricted even if it contains \"constitutionally protected\" material as long the content is \"excessively violent\" - which could very logically apply to Twitter flagging Trump's tweets about \"when the looting begins, the shooting begins\" - and when the content is \"otherwise objectionable\" - which could very logically apply to the factually dubious Trump tweets about vote-by-mail, to which Twitter has appended fact checks.</p><p>The best argument against social media companies like Twitter would be that they are somehow violating this requirement that their moderation be in \"good faith,\" but that's not the argument Cruz is making. Instead, he's suggesting that there's some kind of neutrality requirement that simply isn't in the text.</p><p>In his interview with Recode, Wyden was asked about conservatives making such an argument, and he offered a somewhat diplomatic answer. \"I never want to go after people's sincerity,\" Wyden said, but then added: \"I'm sure there's always kind of the base that gets worked up, and the base hears that somehow this is being used against them.\"</p><p>Propping up social media platforms as unfair arbiters of free speech is indeed a politically potent strategy - especially given that many of them are run by left-leaning people in California. There are few things better in politics than a sense of persecution by all-powerful political opponents like those sitting in their Silicon Valley ivory towers.</p><p>But however accurate it might be to cast any particular tech company as a boogeyman, that doesn't change how this case against them relies upon what looks a whole lot like a straw man. It's also a rather curious argument from someone like Cruz, who fashions himself a textualist relying upon the letter of the law.</p><p>The solution would seem to be to pass bills to change what the law actually says. That's something Cruz is in a position to try to make happen - and for which there may even be significant bipartisan consensus, given the posture of Democrats up to and including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).</p><p>This feels a lot more like a political argument, though, than a legal one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-25cd745cd7884b25b57c71c4d934ce69</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-0TW1-DXKP-J18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><timeReceived>5:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ted Cruz wants to take on the social media giants again, saying the tech companies are using their influence to censor free speech. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Texas Republican told the Washington Examiner Wednesday he planned to revisit his 2018 anti-censorship effort, which led to questions over whether Facebook was an online publisher or platform. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI think there is widespread concern about big tech's willingness to censor speech with which they disagree, and in this time of crisis, they've only gotten worse. YouTube, for example, is censoring discussions about this pandemic that disagree with the positions of the World Health Organization, an organization that has been roundly criticized as functioning as a mouthpiece for the propaganda talking points of the Communist government of China,\u201d Cruz said. </p><p>\u201cNow you have big tech, using its monopoly power to silence any views to the contrary. I think it is highly troubling. And I think there is growing concern and interest in acting to protect free speech,\u201d he added.</p><p>When asked if the issue of whether the tech companies would have to face being called a publisher or platform, Cruz responded: \u201cThat's certainly part of the discussion.\u201d </p><p>In April 2018, Cruz grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before the Senate Judiciary Committee, asking if he thought his company was a neutral public forum. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook was a \u201cplatform for all ideas.\u201d </p><p>Around the same time, Facebook and Twitter drew increased scrutiny, as Republicans claimed the online behemoths were taking actions against conservative users. That led to both companies' CEOs meeting with conservative activists the following year. </p><p>Cruz, however, argued in an op-ed on FoxNews.com that Zuckerberg\u2019s response was significant.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, this is not merely an academic distinction between words. Facebook\u2019s answer to the question could affect millions of users, and attract (or prevent) a lot of attention from federal regulators,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) states: \u2018No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u2019\"</p><p>That means if a person has a blogging platform and a commenter posts a terrorist threat beneath a blog post, the blogger is not treated as the person making the threat. </p><p>\u201cWithout Section 230, many social media networks could be functionally unable to operate,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>To be protected by Section 230, the online tech giants should be \u201cneutral public forums,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>Otherwise, the Texas Republican argues, they should be established as a \u201cpublisher or speaker\u201d of user posts that can be published, emphasized, or removed by company administrators for any reason. </p><p>\u201cBut if Facebook is busy censoring legal, protected speech for political reasons, the company should be held accountable for the posts it lets through. And it should not enjoy any special congressional immunity from liability for its actions,\u201d he wrote. </p><p>Cruz's interpretation of Section 230, though, has been challenged by other legal experts.</p><p>David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told WJLA in 2018 the law was intended for another reason.</p><p>\"Section 230 was passed for the specific purpose to encourage the companies to moderate content,\" he said at the time. \"At that point, they were trying to get them to filter out sexual content.\u201d</p><p>Photo Caption:Sen.

Ted Cruz ripped Facebook, Twitter and Google on Wednesday, threatening the tech giants with antitrust sanctions after charging them with stifling conservative voices and blocking right-leaning ideas from spreading \u2014 something that the companies have denied. Cruz, while leading a Senate Judiciary Committee called Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse, said reports have shown a 'consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of big tech.' </p><p>The Texas Republican then called out the companies for a 'lack of transparency,' saying that the biggest social platforms use obscure rules to crack down on 'disfavored' voices along political lines. If this continues, Cruz argued, lawmakers may be compelled to act against Silicon Valley. Also Read: Most Americans Trust Facebook Less Than the US Government[1] 'By almost any measure the giant tech companies today are larger, and more powerful, than Standard Oil was when it was broken up,' Cruz said. 'And if we have tech companies using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.' Cruz echoed the complaints of many conservatives in the last year who have said companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google overwhelmingly target right-wing users, while failing to take action against liberal users who have also run afoul of their rules. Most notably, digital shock jock Alex Jones was kicked off nearly every major tech platform last summer, with Twitter ultimately joining several of its Bay Area peers in banning Jones for 'abusive behavior'[2] in September. Twitter chief Jack Dorsey told Congress last year 'political ideology' doesn't factor into who it takes action against. His comments came only months after Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told Congress he can understand why conservatives may believe they're unfairly picked on by tech companies. Also Read: Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Could Pay for 'High-Quality News' - Should It?[3] 'I understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place,' Zuckerberg said[4]. 'And this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company is making sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about.' At Wednesday's hearing, Carlos Monje, Twitter's director of public policy and philanthropy, said Twitter is an 'impartial' platform \u2014 and pointed to data suggesting tweets from Republican and Democratic lawmakers receive the same engagement on average. 'Twitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules,' Monje told lawmakers. Also Read: 5 Lingering Twitter Questions That Jack Dorsey Dodged on His Recent Media Blitz[5] Those assertions have done little to curb the skepticism of many Republicans, including President Trump, who blasted 'biased'[6] Facebook, Twitter and Google in November. 'Something is happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter, and I do think we have to get to the bottom of it,' Trump said last month, continuing along the same topic. 'It's collusive, and it's very, very fair to say we have to do something about it.'Related stories from TheWrap: Ron Burgundy Goes All in on 'Ted Cruz Is the Zodiac Killer' Theory[7]Rachel Maddow: Ted Cruz Made His 'Repellent Personality' an Asset[8]Ted Cruz Holds Off Beto O'Rourke in Texas Senate Race[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/04/05/most-americans-dont-trust-facebook/\">https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/04/05/most-americans-dont-trust-facebook/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/twitter-permanently-bans-alex-jones-for-abusive-behavior\">https://www.thewrap.com/twitter-permanently-bans-alex-jones-for-abusive-behavior</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/04/01/mark-zuckerberg-says-facebook-could-pay-for-high-quality-news-should-it/\">https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/04/01/mark-zuckerberg-says-facebook-could-pay-for-high-quality-news-should-it/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/conservatives-press-zuckerberg-on-facebook-political-bias\">https://www.thewrap.com/conservatives-press-zuckerberg-on-facebook-political-bias</url>/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/02/18/5-lingering-twitter-questions-that-jack-dorsey-dodged-on-his-recent-media-blitz/\">https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/02/18/5-lingering-twitter-questions-that-jack-dorsey-dodged-on-his-recent-media-blitz/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/president-trump-blasts-biased-facebook-google\">https://www.thewrap.com/president-trump-blasts-biased-facebook-google</url>/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ron-burgundy-goes-all-in-on-ted-cruz-is-the-zodiac-killer-theory\">https://www.thewrap.com/ron-burgundy-goes-all-in-on-ted-cruz-is-the-zodiac-killer-theory</url>/ [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/rachel-maddow-ted-cruz-knows-that-he-had-a-repellent-personality\">https://www.thewrap.com/rachel-maddow-ted-cruz-knows-that-he-had-a-repellent-personality</url>/ [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ted-cruz-holds-off-beto-orourke-texas-senate-race\">https://www.thewrap.com/ted-cruz-holds-off-beto-orourke-texas-senate-race</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WRAP105650155493038352225176500039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRAP-5357</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVR-F771-F03R-N14C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Wrap</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ted Cruz </nameText></person>threatened social media companies Wednesday with regulation, echoing repeated charges from President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and other top GOP officials that Facebook, Googleand Twitter target the political speech of right-leaning users to limit their online reach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At issue is the opaque process with which these companies make decisions on what's allowed and not allowed on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"What makes the threat of political censorship so problematic is the lack of transparency, the invisibility, the ability for a handful of giant tech companies to decide if a particular speaker is disfavored,\" Cruz said in his opening remarks during Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on \"Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cruz said he'd consider charging \"big tech\" with antitrust violations or fraud or could remove the protection from liability provided by a decades-old federal law.</p><p> Conservatives have offered no evidence of systematic efforts to suppress political speech. The Silicon Valley tech companies say they strike a balance between users' rights to freely express themselves and keeping hate, abuse and misinformation off their platforms. They deny censorship of conservative voices but acknowledge they've made missteps in moderating content. They also concede that their staffers tend to be liberal.</p><p> Democrats have dismissed allegations of anti-conservative bias as a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" Liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America released a study this week that it says shows that right-leaning pages have roughly the same amount of engagement as left-leaning pages on Facebook.</p><p><person><nameText>Sen. Mazie Hirono, </nameText></person>a Democrat from Hawaii, said Wednesday that Congress should increase oversight of the major tech companies but not over allegations of anti-conservative bias, \"which have been disproven time and time again.\"</p><p> Last month, Trump accused all three companies of liberal bias in how they police their online platforms, saying they harbor hatred \"for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election\" and threatened regulation in response.</p><p> \"Something is happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebookand Googleand Twitter, and I do think we have to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said. \"It's collusive, and it's very, very fair to say we have to do something about it.\"</p><p> Allegations of anti-conservative bias has become a rallying cry in recent years for conservative figures such as Diamond and Silk and has been raised in multiple sessions on Capitol Hill.</p><p> White House ally Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, recently filed a lawsuit against Twitter and some of its users for defamation seeking $250 million in damages.</p><p>Facebooktook fire last month for temporarily blocking the account of Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, after mistaking it for an automated account.</p><p> \"It's time for tech companies like Googleand Facebookto start embracing the spirit of the First Amendment. Not just for their own employees, but for all of the Americans who use their platforms,\" Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said during Wednesday's hearing.</p><p> Neil Potts, public policy director at Facebook, told lawmakers that the company had spoken with dozens of members of Congress and conservative groups to assess whether it's \"unintentionally biased\" against conservative viewpoints in an inquiry into allegations of bias led by former Sen. Jon Kyl of Nebraska and a team at the Washington-based law firm Covington &amp; Burling.</p><p> \"Sen. Kyl and his team are now reviewing our external and internal policies. While conducting this review, Sen. Kyl and his team have also been engaged in reviewing and providing insights into future policy changes under consideration,\" Potts said at Wednesday's hearing. \"After Sen. Kyl has reviewed our policies and internal guidelines, he and his team will share feedback and suggestions for improvements.\"</p><p>Facebookhas been a punching bag for conservatives for years. In 2016, reports that its moderators suppressed conservative voices prompted an inquiry by the Senate Commerce Committee. Facebooksaid its internal investigation found no evidence of bias but held a meeting with big names from conservative political and media circles.</p><p> Last May, Facebook's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared on Capitol Hill to answer to the Cambridge Analyticascandal in which the data of 87 million Facebookusers was misappropriated. Conservatives capitalized on the opportunity to accuse Facebookof left-wing favoritism. \"There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebookand other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\" Cruz said.</p><p> Zuckerberg denied Facebook's policies are a product of its liberal cocoon in Silicon Valley but conceded that Facebookdoesn't always make the right call when removing conservative content.</p><p> \"With the amount of content in our systems and the current systems we have in place to review, we have a small amount of mistakes, but that's too many,\" he said at the time. \"I get how people can look at that and build that (censorship) conclusion.\"</p><p> Testifying for Twitter, Carlos Monje, the company's director of public policy and philanthropy, described Twitter as an \"impartial\" platform.</p><p> \"Twitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules,\" he told lawmakers Wednesday.</p><p> Monje said Twitter had its data scientists analyze tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate who have Twitter accounts for a five-week period. Democratic members sent 8,665 tweets and Republican members sent 4,757. Democrats on average have more followers per account and have more active followers. As a result, Democratic members in the aggregate receive more impressions or views than Republicans, Twitter said. But, after controlling for various factors, Twitter said there is no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed and a tweet by a Republican.</p><p> The social media company has had its share of scrapes with conservatives. Blackburn was barred from promoting a campaign video on Twitter because of a reference she made to Planned Parenthood. In the video, Blackburn accused the organization of selling \"baby body parts.\" Twitter said it prevented Blackburn from running the video as an ad because it was too \"inflammatory\" but later reversed that decision.</p><p> Monje repeatedly apologized to Blackburn on Wednesday.</p><p> \"Following an appeal from Sen. Blackburn's media firm, we reviewed the initial decision,\" he said. \"We relied upon additional context that there were no graphic images portrayed and that the concerning language was a very small portion of the overall advertisement. We then reversed the decision and apologized.\"</p><p> Missing at the hearing was Google, which was represented by an empty chair. The Republican-controlled committee rejected the witness the search giant offered because he did not have \"comparable seniority\" to the other witnesses, Cruz said. He pledged to hold a separate hearing on political bias with Google.</p><p>Googlehas repeatedly denied any partisanship in search results. In December, Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai testified that Googleoperates \"without political bias.\" He was hammered by Republican lawmakers who accused the search engine of manipulating results to show conservatives in a negative light or muzzle the viewpoints of right-leaning voices.</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>threatens to regulate Facebook, Googleand Twitter over charges of anti-conservative bias</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-7f5662f435c15d5c9340571f5c20e650bdff2bd8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5F6E919BEC NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-35M1-DXVP-V1JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily American<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Ted Cruz threatened social media companies Wednesday with regulation, echoing repeated charges from President Donald Trump and other top GOP officials that Facebook, Google and Twitter target the political speech of right-leaning users to limit their online reach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At issue is the opaque process with which these companies make decisions on what's allowed and not allowed on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"What makes the threat of political censorship so problematic is the lack of transparency, the invisibility, the ability for a handful of giant tech companies to decide if a particular speaker is disfavored,\" Cruz said in his opening remarks during Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on \"Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cruz said he'd consider charging \"big tech\" with antitrust violations or fraud or could remove the protection from liability provided by a decades-old federal law.</p><p> Conservatives have offered no evidence of systematic efforts to suppress political speech. The Silicon Valley tech companies say they strike a balance between users' rights to freely express themselves and keeping hate, abuse and misinformation off their platforms. They deny censorship of conservative voices but acknowledge they've made missteps in moderating content. They also concede that their staffers tend to be liberal.</p><p> Democrats have dismissed allegations of anti-conservative bias as a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" Liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America released a study this week that it says shows that right-leaning pages have roughly the same amount of engagement as left-leaning pages on Facebook.</p><p> Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said Wednesday that Congress should increase oversight of the major tech companies but not over allegations of anti-conservative bias, \"which have been disproven time and time again.\"</p><p> Last month, Trump accused all three companies of liberal bias in how they police their online platforms, saying they harbor hatred \"for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election\" and threatened regulation in response.</p><p> \"Something is happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter, and I do think we have to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said. \"It's collusive, and it's very, very fair to say we have to do something about it.\"</p><p> Allegations of anti-conservative bias has become a rallying cry in recent years for conservative figures such as Diamond and Silk and has been raised in multiple sessions on Capitol Hill.</p><p> White House ally Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, recently filed a lawsuit against Twitter and some of its users for defamation seeking $250 million in damages.</p><p>Facebook took fire last month for temporarily blocking the account of Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, after mistaking it for an automated account.</p><p> \"It's time for tech companies like Google and Facebook to start embracing the spirit of the First Amendment. Not just for their own employees, but for all of the Americans who use their platforms,\" Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said during Wednesday's hearing.</p><p> Neil Potts, public policy director at Facebook, told lawmakers that the company had spoken with dozens of members of Congress and conservative groups to assess whether it's \"unintentionally biased\" against conservative viewpoints in an inquiry into allegations of bias led by former Sen. Jon Kyl of Nebraska and a team at the Washington-based law firm Covington &amp; Burling.</p><p> \"Sen. Kyl and his team are now reviewing our external and internal policies. While conducting this review, Sen. Kyl and his team have also been engaged in reviewing and providing insights into future policy changes under consideration,\" Potts said at Wednesday's hearing. \"After Sen. Kyl has reviewed our policies and internal guidelines, he and his team will share feedback and suggestions for improvements.\"</p><p>Facebook has been a punching bag for conservatives for years. In 2016, reports that its moderators suppressed conservative voices prompted an inquiry by the Senate Commerce Committee. Facebook said its internal investigation found no evidence of bias but held a meeting with big names from conservative political and media circles.</p><p> Last May, Facebook's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared on Capitol Hill to answer to the Cambridge Analyticascandal in which the data of 87 million Facebook users was misappropriated. Conservatives capitalized on the opportunity to accuse Facebook of left-wing favoritism. \"There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\" Cruz said.</p><p> Zuckerberg denied Facebook's policies are a product of its liberal cocoon in Silicon Valley but conceded that Facebook doesn't always make the right call when removing conservative content.</p><p> \"With the amount of content in our systems and the current systems we have in place to review, we have a small amount of mistakes, but that's too many,\" he said at the time. \"I get how people can look at that and build that (censorship) conclusion.\"</p><p> Testifying for Twitter, Carlos Monje, the company's director of public policy and philanthropy, described Twitter as an \"impartial\" platform.</p><p> \"Twitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules,\" he told lawmakers Wednesday.</p><p> Monje said Twitter had its data scientists analyze tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate who have Twitter accounts for a five-week period. Democratic members sent 8,665 tweets and Republican members sent 4,757. Democrats on average have more followers per account and have more active followers. As a result, Democratic members in the aggregate receive more impressions or views than Republicans, Twitter said. But, after controlling for various factors, Twitter said there is no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed and a tweet by a Republican.</p><p> The social media company has had its share of scrapes with conservatives. Blackburn was barred from promoting a campaign video on Twitter because of a reference she made to Planned Parenthood. In the video, Blackburn accused the organization of selling \"baby body parts.\" Twitter said it prevented Blackburn from running the video as an ad because it was too \"inflammatory\" but later reversed that decision.</p><p> Monje repeatedly apologized to Blackburn on Wednesday.</p><p> \"Following an appeal from Sen. Blackburn's media firm, we reviewed the initial decision,\" he said. \"We relied upon additional context that there were no graphic images portrayed and that the concerning language was a very small portion of the overall advertisement. We then reversed the decision and apologized.\"</p><p> Missing at the hearing was Google, which was represented by an empty chair. The Republican-controlled committee rejected the witness the search giant offered because he did not have \"comparable seniority\" to the other witnesses, Cruz said. He pledged to hold a separate hearing on political bias with Google.</p><p>Google has repeatedly denied any partisanship in search results. In December, Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai testified that Google operates \"without political bias.\" He was hammered by Republican lawmakers who accused the search engine of manipulating results to show conservatives in a negative light or muzzle the viewpoints of right-leaning voices.</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ted Cruz threatens to regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter over charges of anti-conservative bias</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-4b261b5ec1311ff07d522533c762c97fb2eb162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVT-X9H1-JBCN-455T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

That\u2019s why Silicon Valley is so worried about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TikTok, which is run by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">a seven-year-old company in Beijing called ByteDance</url>, allows people to create short, snappy videos and share them around the world. That simple concept has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">fueled its rise</url> to quickly become one of the world\u2019s largest social networks and to mount the most direct incursion yet by a Chinese company into Silicon Valley\u2019s turf.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the American internet companies are pushing back. Through knockoffs, potential acquisitions and not-so-subtle references to Chinese censorship, TikTok\u2019s competitors have been trying to protect their home turf from the service\u2019s advancement. They haven\u2019t had much luck so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past 12 months, TikTok\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 750 million times, compared with 715 million for Facebook, 450 million for Instagram, 300 million for YouTube and 275 million for Snapchat, according to the research firm Sensor Tower.</p><p>But TikTok\u2019s American competitors could still get some help from their government. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States</url>, a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American firms, is now reviewing ByteDance\u2019s two-year-old acquisition of Musical.ly, the American company that became TikTok, The New York Times and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">Reuters reported</url> on Friday. Members of Congress had asked for a review last month.</p><p>A government intervention would probably be welcome news to TikTok\u2019s competitors, who have been working from their usual, crush-the-upstart playbook.</p><p>Late last year, Facebook launched a TikTok clone called Lasso. That app has been downloaded fewer than 500,000 times, mostly in Mexico, according to Sensor Tower. While many videos in TikTok\u2019s endless feed of 15- to 60-second clips have hundreds of thousands of \u201clikes,\u201d the videos in Lasso\u2019s nearly identical feed typically have a few dozen.</p><p>At YouTube, executives are also considering ways to imitate TikTok, including adding similar video-editing software within the YouTube app, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans are private.</p><p>Google, which owns YouTube, also held acquisition talks with Firework, a TikTok imitator that is aiming for older users, according to three people close to the talks who requested anonymity because the negotiations were confidential. One of those people said Google decided against acquiring Firework.</p><p>Firework, which has less than three million downloads, has also received interest from Baidu, China\u2019s biggest search engine company, and Weibo, which runs the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, according to two people close to the talks. The Wall Street Journal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">first reported</url>Google\u2019s and Weibo\u2019s interest in Firework.</p><p>\u201cThey see that TikTok right now is having a moment, and they have natural concern when any other app gains share in attention,\u201d Eugene Wei, a longtime tech and media executive who now tracks the industries, said of the big tech companies. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen another consumer app make that much headway in attention market share in recent history.\u201d</p><p>At Snap, which some analysts believe is most threatened by TikTok\u2019s rise because both target young people, the chief executive, Evan Spiegel, has argued that the companies don\u2019t compete.</p><p>TikTok largely gives people entertainment from strangers while Snapchat connects friends, he said. When asked by an analyst during an earnings call last month whether TikTok is a \u201cfriend or foe,\u201d he responded that TikTok advertises on Snapchat and has also built services for the app. \u201cI think at a high level, looking at TikTok, we definitely consider them a friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>In April, Snap began listing TikTok as a competitor in its regulatory filings.</p><p>[Get the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">Bits newsletter</url> for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, told employees in July that TikTok \u201cis really the first consumer internet product built by one of the Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the world,\u201d according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">a transcript of the meeting published by the Verge</url>.</p><p>He noted that it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">popular with young Americans</url> and had surpassed Instagram in India. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have a number of approaches that we\u2019re going to take towards this.\u201d</p><p>Lasso isn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s only hedge against TikTok. In September, an app researcher in Hong Kong named Jane Manchun Wong <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">noticed some computer code in Instagram</url>, which is owned by Facebook, that revealed the app was testing a feature called Clips. The feature allows users to edit videos much like TikTok, splicing clips together and adding music.</p><p>Copying fast-growing upstarts has been a successful playbook for Facebook. Instagram\u2019s popular \u201cStories\u201d feature, which lets users post short, ephemeral videos, closely resembles Snapchat\u2019s main function.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg suggested those short \u201cStories\u201d videos are a way Facebook can compete. In response to a question about Facebook\u2019s \u201cplan of attack\u201d against TikTok, Mr. Zuckerberg told employees in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">the July meeting</url> that Facebook was making Stories an even more central part of Instagram.</p><p>And last month, Mr. Zuckerberg seized on TikTok\u2019s Chinese roots to criticize it publicly. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">a speech at Georgetown University</url> in which he promoted Facebook as an American company eager to protect free speech, he said, \u201cChina is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\u201d</p><p>As evidence, he cited reports that there were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">few signs of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok</url>.</p><p>\u201cWhile our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that the internet we want?\u201d</p><p>Josh Gartner, a ByteDance spokesman, said that the Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content and that the app\u2019s content policies are led by a team in the United States and are not influenced by any government.</p><p>\u201cWe have said clearly that these accusations are false,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is an unfortunate attempt by Mark Zuckerberg to redirect scrutiny onto a competitor that he\u2019s failed to copy.\u201d</p><p>TikTok has faced earlier scrutiny. In February, ByteDance <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html\">agreed to pay</url> a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that Musical.ly illegally collected information on users under the age of 13.</p><p>While they plot to take on TikTok, tech executives have also tried to play down the threat. Mr. Zuckerberg told employees in July that Facebook research shows TikTok is spending a lot to acquire users, who then don\u2019t stick around for long.</p><p>Independent estimates suggest TikTok does retain fewer users than rivals. In June, about 26 percent of new TikTok users were still using the app a week later, according to estimates from App Annie, an app data firm. Facebook\u2019s retention rate was 45 percent, Instagram\u2019s was 44 percent and Snapchat\u2019s 32 percent. By September, TikTok\u2019s rate had risen to 39 percent.</p><p>\u201cIt is growing, but they\u2019re spending a huge amount of money promoting it. What we\u2019ve found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cSo the space is still fairly nascent, and there\u2019s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do.\u201d</p><p>Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas Kate Conger contributed reporting. </p><p>PHOTO: TikTok\u2019s United States launch party in August.

That's why Silicon Valley is so worried about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TikTok, which is run by a seven-year-old company in Beijing called ByteDance, allows people to create short, snappy videos and share them around the world. That simple concept has fueled its rise to quickly become one of the world's largest social networks and to mount the most direct incursion yet by a Chinese company into Silicon Valley's turf.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the American internet companies are pushing back. Through knockoffs, potential acquisitions and not-so-subtle references to Chinese censorship, TikTok's competitors have been trying to protect their home turf from the service's advancement. They haven't had much luck so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past 12 months, TikTok's app has been downloaded more than 750 million times, compared with 715 million for Facebook, 450 million for Instagram, 300 million for YouTube and 275 million for Snapchat, according to the research firm Sensor Tower.</p><p>But TikTok's American competitors could still get some help from their government. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American firms, is now reviewing ByteDance's two-year-old acquisition of Musical.ly, the American company that became TikTok, The New York Times and Reuters reported on Friday. Members of Congress had asked for a review last month.</p><p>A government intervention would probably be welcome news to TikTok's competitors, who have been working from their usual, crush-the-upstart playbook.</p><p>Late last year, Facebook launched a TikTok clone called Lasso. That app has been downloaded fewer than 500,000 times, mostly in Mexico, according to Sensor Tower. While many videos in TikTok's endless feed of 15- to 60-second clips have hundreds of thousands of \"likes,\" the videos in Lasso's nearly identical feed typically have a few dozen.</p><p>At YouTube, executives are also considering ways to imitate TikTok, including adding similar video-editing software within the YouTube app, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans are private.</p><p>Google, which owns YouTube, also held acquisition talks with Firework, a TikTok imitator that is aiming for older users, according to three people close to the talks who requested anonymity because the negotiations were confidential. One of those people said Google decided against acquiring Firework.</p><p>Firework, which has less than three million downloads, has also received interest from Baidu, China's biggest search engine company, and Weibo, which runs the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, according to two people close to the talks. The Wall Street Journal first reported Google's and Weibo's interest in Firework.</p><p>\"They see that TikTok right now is having a moment, and they have natural concern when any other app gains share in attention,\" Eugene Wei, a longtime tech and media executive who now tracks the industries, said of the big tech companies. \"And we haven't seen another consumer app make that much headway in attention market share in recent history.\"</p><p>At Snap, which some analysts believe is most threatened by TikTok's rise because both target young people, the chief executive, Evan Spiegel, has argued that the companies don't compete.</p><p>TikTok largely gives people entertainment from strangers while Snapchat connects friends, he said. When asked by an analyst during an earnings call last month whether TikTok is a \"friend or foe,\" he responded that TikTok advertises on Snapchat and has also built services for the app. \"I think at a high level, looking at TikTok, we definitely consider them a friend,\" he said.</p><p>In April, Snap began listing TikTok as a competitor in its regulatory filings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Get the </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bits newsletter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]</emphasis></p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, told employees in July that TikTok \"is really the first consumer internet product built by one of the Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the world,\" according to a transcript of the meeting published by the Verge.</p><p>He noted that it was popular with young Americans and had surpassed Instagram in India. \"It's a very interesting phenomenon,\" he said. \"So we have a number of approaches that we're going to take towards this.\"</p><p>Lasso isn't Facebook's only hedge against TikTok. In September, an app researcher in Hong Kong named Jane Manchun Wong noticed some computer code in Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, that revealed the app was testing a feature called Clips. The feature allows users to edit videos much like TikTok, splicing clips together and adding music.</p><p>Copying fast-growing upstarts has been a successful playbook for Facebook. Instagram's popular \"Stories\" feature, which lets users post short, ephemeral videos, closely resembles Snapchat's main function.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg suggested those short \"Stories\" videos are a way Facebook can compete. In response to a question about Facebook's \"plan of attack\" against TikTok, Mr. Zuckerberg told employees in the July meeting that Facebook was making Stories an even more central part of Instagram.</p><p>And last month, Mr. Zuckerberg seized on TikTok's Chinese roots to criticize it publicly. In a speech at Georgetown University in which he promoted Facebook as an American company eager to protect free speech, he said, \"China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\"</p><p>As evidence, he cited reports that there were few signs of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok.</p><p>\"While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the U.S.,\" he said. \"Is that the internet we want?\"</p><p>Josh Gartner, a ByteDance spokesman, said that the Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content and that the app's content policies are led by a team in the United States and are not influenced by any government.</p><p>\"We have said clearly that these accusations are false,\" he said in a statement. \"This is an unfortunate attempt by Mark Zuckerberg to redirect scrutiny onto a competitor that he's failed to copy.\"</p><p>TikTok has faced earlier scrutiny. In February, ByteDance agreed to pay a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that Musical.ly illegally collected information on users under the age of 13.</p><p>While they plot to take on TikTok, tech executives have also tried to play down the threat. Mr. Zuckerberg told employees in July that Facebook research shows TikTok is spending a lot to acquire users, who then don't stick around for long.</p><p>Independent estimates suggest TikTok does retain fewer users than rivals. In June, about 26 percent of new TikTok users were still using the app a week later, according to estimates from App Annie, an app data firm. Facebook's retention rate was 45 percent, Instagram's was 44 percent and Snapchat's 32 percent. By September, TikTok's rate had risen to 39 percent.</p><p>\"It is growing, but they're spending a huge amount of money promoting it. What we've found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said. \"So the space is still fairly nascent, and there's time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas Kate Conger contributed reporting. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006779351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF0-67H1-JC85-N0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
